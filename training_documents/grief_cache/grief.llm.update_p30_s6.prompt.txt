You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

4v5o | Sense of Presence
ha9e | This is the cognitive counterpart to the experience of yearning. The grieving person may think that the deceased is somehow still in the cur- rent area of time and space. This can be especially true during the time shortly after the death. In our study of bereaved children, 81% of the children felt watched by their dead parent 4 months after the death, and this experience continued for many of the children (66%) 2 years after the death. Some found this sense of presence comforting, while others did not and were scared by it (Worden, 1996).
xrnt | Hallucinations
c8ra | Hallucinations of both the visual type and the auditory type are included in this list of normal behaviors because hallucinations can be a frequent experience of the bereaved. They are usually transient illu- sory experiences, often occurring within a few weeks following the loss, and generally do not portend a more difficult or complicated mourn- ing experience. Although disconcerting to some, many others find these experiences comforting. With all the interest in mysticism and spiritual- ity, it is interesting to speculate whether these are really hallucinations or possibly some other kind of metaphysical phenomenon (Kersting, 2004).
p1l0 | 1 Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief
1i8b | There is an obvious interface between thinking and feeling, and the current interest in cognitive psychology and cognitive therapy empha- sizes this. Aaron Beck and his colleagues (1979) at the University of Pennsylvania found that the experience of depression frequently is trig- gered by depressive thought patterns. In the bereaved, certain thoughts will pass through the mind such as "I can't live without her" or "I'll never find love again." These thoughts can then trigger very intense, but normal, feelings of sadness and / or anxiety.
5sfj | Behaviors
vk4h | There are a number of specific behaviors frequently associated with normal grief reactions. These can range from sleep and appetite dis- turbances to absentmindedness and social withdrawal. The following behaviors are commonly reported after a loss and usually correct them- selves over time.
nsm3 | Sleep Disturbances
jdfw | It is not unusual for people who are in the early stages of loss to expe- rience sleep disturbances. These may include difficulty going to sleep or early morning awakening. Sleep disturbances sometimes require medical intervention, but in normal grief they usually correct them- selves. In the Harvard Child Bereavement Study, one-fifth of the chil- dren showed some sleep disturbance in the first 4 months after the death of one of their parents. Without any special intervention, this figure dropped to a level not significantly different from that of their nonbereaved matched counterparts 1 and 2 years following the death (Worden, 1996).
uc9r | After Bill lost his wife suddenly, he would wake up at five o'clock each morning filled with intense sadness and review over and over the circumstances surrounding the death and how it might have been pre- vented, including what he might have done differently. This happened morning after morning and soon caused problems because he could not function well at work. After about 6 weeks, the disorder began to cor- rect itself, and eventually it disappeared. This is not an unusual experi- ence. However, if sleep disorder persists, it may indicate a more serious depressive disorder, which should be explored (Tanimukai et al., 2015). Sleep disorders can sometimes symbolize various fears, including the fear of dreaming, the fear of being in bed alone, and the fear of not awakening. After her husband died, one woman solved the problem posed by her fear of being alone in bed by taking her dog to bed with

x815 | her. The sound of the dog's breathing comforted her, and she continued to do this for almost a year until she was able to sleep alone.
epbj | Eating Disturbances
nmn2 | Bereaved animals exhibit eating disturbances, which are also very com- mon in human mourning situations. Although appetite disturbances can manifest themselves in terms of both overeating and undereating, undereating is the more frequently described grief behavior. Significant changes in weight may result from changes in eating patterns.
g3tm | Distracted and Absentminded Behavior
tfra | The newly bereaved may find themselves acting in an absentminded way or doing things that may ultimately cause them inconvenience or harm. One client was concerned because on three separate occasions she had driven across the city in her car and, after completing her busi- ness, had forgotten that she had driven and returned home via public transportation. This behavior occurred following the death of a close friend and eventually corrected itself.
5lm9 | Social Withdrawal
wp2c | It is not unusual for people who have sustained a loss to want to with- draw from other people. Again, this is usually a short-lived phenome- non and corrects itself. I saw one young woman shortly after the death of her mother. This single woman was a very sociable person who loved to go to parties. For several months following her mother's death, she declined all invitations because they seemed dissonant to the way she felt in the early experiences of her grief. This may seem obvious and appropriate to the reader, but this woman saw her withdrawal as abnor- mal. Some people withdraw from friends perceived as oversolicitous. "My friends tried so hard that I wanted to avoid them. How many times can you hear, 'I'm sorry?'" Social withdrawal can also include a loss of interest in the outside world, such as not reading newspapers or watch- ing television. Bereaved children who have lost a parent to death can also experience social withdrawal in the early months after the death (Silverman & Worden, 1993).
us5v | Dreams of the Deceased
rs2m | It's very common to dream of the dead person, both normal kinds of dreams and distressing dreams or nightmares. Often these dreams serve a number of purposes and may give some diagnostic clues as to where the person is in the whole course of mourning (Cookson, 1990).
uz9y | 1 Attachment, Loss, and the Experience of Grief
8ov0 | For example, for several years after the death of her mother, Esther suffered from intense guilt over circumstances related to the death. This guilt was manifested in low self-esteem and personal recrimination and was associated with considerable anxiety. During one of her daily visits to her mother in the hospital, Esther had left the bedside for coffee and a bite of food. While she was out, her mother died.
mj9m | Esther was filled with remorse, and although we used the usual reality-testing techniques in therapy, the guilt still persisted. While in therapy, she had a dream about her mother. In this dream, she saw her- self trying to assist her mother to walk down a slippery pathway so she would not fall. But her mother fell, and nothing Esther could do in the dream would save her. It was impossible. This dream was a signif- icant turning point in her therapy because she allowed herself to see that nothing she could have done would have kept her mother from dying. This important insight gave her permission to shed the guilt that she had been carrying for several years. Some ways to utilize dreams in grief counseling and grief therapy are presented in Chapter 6.
94h3 | Avoiding Reminders of the Deceased
9jx1 | Some people will avoid places or things that trigger painful feelings of grief. They might avoid the place where the deceased died, the cemetery, or objects that remind them of their lost loved one. One middle-aged woman came for grief counseling when her husband died after a series of coronary attacks, leaving her with two children. For a period of time she put all pictures of her husband away in the closet, along with other things that reminded her of him. This obviously was only a short-term solution, and as she moved toward a better adaptation of her grief, she was able to bring out the items that she wanted to live with and display his picture on the piano.
