        "content": "nvfy | lymphocyte count less than one point two cells per microliter times one thousand three, which is the lower limit of normal at our institution, persisting beyond seventy-two hours after sepsis diagnosis. Clinical outcomes included the delta-SOFA score (change in SOFA score based on laboratory studies and vital signs from the twenty-four-hour period prior to the start of the intervention compared to score based on data from the twenty-four-hour period after completion of the intervention), twenty-eight-day hospital-free days, twenty-eight-day ventilator-free days, acquisition of secondary infections, and twenty-eight-day mor- tality. Secondary infections were defined as new pos- itive cultures or new antibiotics started after forty-eight hours and documentation of a new confirmed infection by the treating clinical team.\nmror | The safety outcomes of interest were vasopressor dose (expressed as norepinephrine-equivalent dose), heart rate, and respiratory rate.\nzlxc | Immunological Testing\nk0bw | Immunological testing was performed by laboratory technicians blinded to participant group allocation. Quantification of monocyte HLA-DR was performed according to the Demaret method, as previously described. Whole blood was incubated with BD Quantibrite anti-HLA-DR/anti-monocyte stain (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, California), lysed using RBC Lysis Buffer (BioLegend, San Diego, California), and fixed in two percent paraformaldehyde. Samples were acquired on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) with a five-color up- grade (CyTech, Fremont, California). Flow files were acquired and analyzed in CellQuest Pro (Becton-Dickinson). Antibodies bound per cell were calculated by standardizing HLA-DR geomean fluorescent intensity of monocytes to BD Quantibrite-phycoerythrin beads (Becton-Dickinson).\naq5a | CD3/CD28-induced IFN-y production was deter- mined using an Enzyme-Linked Immunospot assay, as previously described. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested from whole blood plated at a standardized density, five hundred thousand cells per well, using the Vi-Cell counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California) in wells coated with biotinylated capture antibody spe- cific to IFN-y. Cells were incubated overnight with Roswell Park Memorial Institute sixteen-forty media (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) containing anti-CD3/anti-CD28 (BioLegend). IFN-y was detected using a colorimetric reagent kit (Strep-AP and BCIP-NBT; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Images from the ELISpot plates\nsc5y | (made by MilliporeSigma, Burlington, Massachusetts; and acquired through Fisher Scientific, Hampton, New Hampshire) were analyzed on ImmunoSpot seven point zero plate reader and software (Cellular Technologies Limited, Shaker Heights, Ohio). The number of spots, representing cells producing IFN- y, and mean spot size were recorded. The means of two identically treated plates run in duplicate were calculated.\n0yab | Sample Size Determination\nw95z | To detect a difference in HLA-DR expression of twelve thousand antibodies bound per cell with a power of eighty percent using a two-sided alpha equals zero point zero five, a total of forty-four sepsis participants (twenty-two patients per arm) were required. The detectable difference in HLA-DR expres- sion was the magnitude of the difference in patients with who did and did not experience an increase in body temperature of one point five degrees Celsius within twenty-four hours of sepsis diagnosis in our preliminary data. Anticipating control group mortality of twenty percent prior to acquisition of the postintervention blood sample, enrollment of fifty-six participants was planned.\n0i1k | Statistical Analysis\ndqlg | Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis re- gardless of whether temperature goals were met in the intervention group. Descriptive statistics are pre- sented as counts, means, and medians, as appropriate. Temperature and care-associated variables were com- pared using t tests, repeated measures analysis of vari- ance, Mann-Whitney U tests, or chi-square tests as appropriate. The primary HLA-DR and sec- ondary serum IFN-y analyses were performed among participants who had nonmissing values for both the baseline and follow-up immune outcomes using re- peated measures ANOVA. Hospital-free days and ven- tilator-free days were compared using nonparametric tests. To ensure that any twenty-eight-day mortality difference observed was not attributable to confounding by illness severity, we conducted a post hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis, including predictors of both treat- ment group assignment and enrollment SOFA score. All analyses were conducted in Stata version sixteen point one (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas).\np6pq | RESULTS\nzse6 | We enrolled fifty-six participants (twenty-eight in each arm), with none lost to follow-up.\np2n3 | Baseline Characteristics\nohh7 | covariates at randomization. The most common source of infection was pneumonia (n equals twenty-nine), and the most common reason for exclusion was concurrent immune suppression.\nvbni | The temperature in participants randomized to ther- apeutic warming during the study period was higher than those allocated to usual care (repeated measures ANOVA) (Fig. one). Twenty-six participants (ninety-three percent) in the warming group achieved target tempera- ture, with eighteen (sixty-nine percent) reaching the target within six hours. The median time to target temperature was three hours (interquartile range, two to four hours) in the warming group. Ten participants (thirty-six percent) had warming terminated prior to forty-eight hours, with the most common reason being extubation during the intervention period (n equals five). Two participants had missing immune bio- marker values, one due to death prior to sample being drawn and one due to misplacement of the sample (these cases were excluded from immune biomarker analysis). Corticosteroid therapy was administered during the ICU stay (after randomization) for nine control participants (thirty-two percent) and eight intervention par- ticipants (twenty-nine percent).\ndgcw | Immunological Outcomes\ngvwz | HLA-DR expression at enrollment was similar be- tween the two groups (difference sixty-three point eight, antibodies bound per cell; ninety-five percent CI, negative three thousand three hundred thirty-six point eight to three thousand four hundred sixty-four point four). For our primary outcome,\nsk5m | there was no difference between treatment and control groups in monocyte HLA-DR expression following the forty-eight-hour intervention period (differ- ence, negative one thousand three hundred ten point four; ninety-five percent CI, negative four thousand five hundred thirty-seven point five to one thousand nine hundred sixteen point eight; Fig. two). Overall, patients who died had lower HLA-DR ex- pression at enrollment (mean six thousand five hundred twenty-two point four vs ten thousand four hundred thirty-eight point five).\nqws8 | (p equals zero point zero three). CD3/CD28-induced IFN-y production was similar between groups at baseline (difference, negative two hundred thirty-one point one; ninety-five percent CI, negative five hundred twenty-eight point five to sixty-six point two), and no difference was observed at three to four days (difference, negative thirty-eight point zero; ninety-five percent CI, negative two hundred twenty point four to one hundred forty-four point four). Persistent lymphopenia was similar between the groups (fifty percent vs forty-three percent; difference, negative seven percent; ninety-five percent CI, negative thirty-three to nineteen).\n877u | Clinical Outcomes",
