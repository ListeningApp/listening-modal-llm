You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

r8sm | Gendered film studies looks at the social purpose(s) of our stories and myths. Ideas and images of 'the masculine' or 'the feminine' are social constructions, and so we must attend to them as such, and ask who is creating these images. Whom do they benefit? Language is not a neutral medium of communication. Discourse/ language is the medium through which social power relations between different groups are reinforced or re-negotiated. We need to ask what kind of world the film constructs and whose values and ideas are being expressed through it. Do the film's representations challenge or affirm our own experiences of the world? Do

n1i7 | they construct a world of appearances that does not reflect our experiences? What purpose do the film's representations serve? Whose interests are best served by it? The key here is to remember that films (and other media) do not merely record the world as it is. They construct an image of the world, a mediated version of the world.
0r5m | Following theorists such as Sarah Gilligan, it should be fairly clear that women have historically functioned within mainstream cinema as the following:
ne2o | · Girlfriend.
sqxn | · Damsel in distress.
6pmo | · Angelic mother.
195r | · Whore.
kqmi | · Sexual object.
g8rd | · Erotic distraction.
nns9 | · Femme fatale/monster.
9uwy | · Castrating mother.
srly | Looking at the list above, we see that the stereotypical role of the female in the traditional Hollywood film has not been that of an agent. She does not drive the narrative action, nor is she involved in changing the storyline. As Sarah Gilligan says, 'her role within the film is to look good and to make the male protagonist look even better. Women are rarely cast in positions of power, and when they are, they are punished for their power. . . Woman's traditional role is to be helpless, need rescuing or agree with the actions and decisions of the male protagonist' (Gilligan 2003: 18).
dl6i | There should be a woman, but not much of one. A good horse is much more important. (Max Brand in Avni 2005)
89ub | Feminist critics point out that these cinematic representations are mediated through the eyes and desires of the male director. The crucial point to remember is that woman exists as both a construction and a reality. 'Woman' is both a category, defined in opposition to men, and an individual physical person. We need only look around us at a few real women to understand that the image 'woman' does not always reflect the reality, and vice versa. Real individual women can, and do, perform 'womanhood' (as an image) but this image is not one that women have traditionally had a role in constructing. She is imitating an idealised and eroticised male construction of what women 'should' be. 'Woman' comes to represent not one person of the female sex, but a stereotype, a category defined by men and in

It is in the interests of those in power to continue to stereotype those with lower status in a negative or expedient light, thus preserving the status quo (Nelmes 2003: 227).
naev | Even today, women have a relatively small role in constructing public images of womanhood'. A recent survey carried out by the UK Film Council and Skillset, the Sector Skills Council for the Audio Visual Industries, found that women in the British film industry are paid less than men even though they are better qualified. The survey found that women made up a third of the industry but 35% of women earn less than £20,000 a year, compared with 18% of men. At the same time, the number of men earning more than £50,000 nearly doubles the female figure. Women in the film industry were more likely to be graduates than men (60% compared with 39%), and while 17% of men have no qualifications, the same is true for just 5% of women. A June 2015 report by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that in 2012 only 26% of employees in the digital and creative industries were female, substantially lower than the national average of 47%, and down from 33% in 2002.2
7h0h | In her study of employment figures for behind-the-scenes women working on the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2004, Dr Martha M. Lauzen of San Diego State University found that 21% of the films employed no women directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers or editors. Yet not a single one of the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2004 failed to employ a man in at least one of these roles. The study also found that women comprised only 5% of all directors working on the top 250 films of 2004. This represents a decline of 6 percentage points since 2000 when women accounted for 11% of all directors. Women accounted for only 12% of writers working on the top 250 films of 2004. In addition, female actors generally earn less than male actors.
a64c | The majority of directors in Hollywood are male and the majority of producers are male. This probably holds true in cinemas around the world. The movies that get the publicity budgets are made within male genres-blockbusters, war, science fiction or thrillers. These films seem to feature a central male character who is facing a male villain, and has a male best friend (who often gets killed by the villain in the penultimate reel, justifying the hero's killing of the villain). The female characters are there to titillate, to be in distress and rescued, and occasionally to guarantee the heterosexuality of the hero. (Butler 2002: 42)
gi7n | Lauzen's figures for 2011 were equally grim, with women comprising only 18% of all directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers and editors working on the US top 250 domestic grossing films. This represents an increase of 1 percentage point from 1998. Women accounted for 5% of directors, which is half as many as were directing films in 1998. Ninety-four per cent (94%) of all the films

3yxv | In addition, female actors generally earn less than male actors for equivalent sized roles, with Angelina Jolie (the highest paid female actor) making $33 million per film on average, roughly the same amount as the two lowest-ranked leading men Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington. Of the 16 biggest paychecks earned by actors per film in 2013, not a single one was earned by a female actor.3 In 2015 a hack of Sony Pictures emails revealed that Jennifer Lawrence was paid only 7% of the profits of American Hustle's (2013), whereas both of her male co-stars (Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper) were paid 9%, as was director David O. Russell.
d8zj | Like other ideological constructions, representations of a society or of gender are not stable; their political and cultural importance are such that they are sites of considerable competition. As Graeme Turner has noted, 'To gain control of the representational agenda for the nation is to gain considerable power over individuals' view of themselves and each other' (Turner 1988: 136-7).
