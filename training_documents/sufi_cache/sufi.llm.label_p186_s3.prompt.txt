You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3cxo | I am reminded of the old saying: The child remarks, 'That hawk is white', while the adult asks 'How sharp are its talons?'
zxlu | And I hope that we do not forget, while we are on this subject, that most of the most prized traditions in the West are derived, and not without pride, from the Middle East, and especially the Eastern Mediterranean ...

ikzp | How does the Sufi Teach?
o2co | Q: Sufis do not teach by 'stereotypes', as you often say. How does the Sufi teach?
932d | A: The Sufi teacher has the task of communicating his message and reality. He has to reduce, not increase, the effect of his own personality, in favour of content.
eab8 | A test of the suitability of a student is to find out whether he can set aside the fixation upon a technique, person or school - and make himself open to receive a comprehensive teaching.
78uf | The Sufi teacher's mission is to be in the service of those who can learn. He does not exist to please or to displease anyone. To accord with the preconceptions of others as to appearances is irrelevant to his functions: though not necessarily, as Ibn Arabi reminds us, to his social viability.
d4u8 | He works in accordance with the prospects of his students and the possibility of maintaining the continuation of the community of Sufis.
hi2c | He does not hand out formulas nor does he insist upon the performance of mechanical procedures. His knowledge, on the contrary, makes it possible for him to prescribe apposite studies for suitable people, at an indicated time, in the proper place.
xhx2 | Most people, whatever their opinions and protestations, do not want to learn. Contrary to appearances, they tend to engage in activities which they use as a substitute for learning. These activi- ties they call 'studies'.
64tz | Sometimes this proclivity is one which has been trained into them, through books or human contact, even by well-meaning imitators. This causes it to be assumed that certain shallow ex- periences represent spirituality or the transcendent, or have some other significance which is in fact absent
myvp | If you really want to learn, do not be surprised if someone tries to teach you. And do not lightly reject the method. People who do not know the real bases of a study are, of course, likely to be
nr73 | 194
a2o9 | surprised when its methods are revealed to them.
e4rj | This revelation is what is known to Sufis as heart-knowledge. Dhun'nun says:
7u2p | What the eyes see is knowledge. What the heart knows is Certainty.
l5og | False certainty is obsession, whether implanted or otherwise.
x06y | Most people nowadays are educated by means of mechanical thinking and within very limited frameworks which, in turn, enable them only to handle certain kinds of experience. This education is excellent, but only for its own purposes. Products of this training use its impoverished and restrictive principles to 'assess' such things as Sufi learning. No wonder we get bizarre results!
lhv3 | Rumi tells of a Sufi and a grammarian who were sitting to- gether. The grammarian announced that 'A word must be one of three things' referring to the grammatical assessment. At once the Sufi went into a frenzy and cried out: 'I have struggled for twenty years in the hope that there was more to a word than this, and now you have removed my hope I'
d14u | In this way the Sufi tried to point out to the grammarian that his terms of study were far too narrow, and certainly could not be sustained without the preamble that 'this holds true in grammar' ...
w90k | There is another factor in teaching and learning, portrayed in a story.
2vn7 | IN A LIBRARY
mv86 | Three dervishes met in a library.
8miy | The first said: I am going to read all the books of Sufi wisdom. Then I shall ponder their meanings and see how they relate to me.'
h5l3 | The second said: I shall copy out the books in my own hand, so that their lessons may sink in. Then I shall review them in their inner and outer significance.'
77nj | The third said: 'I shall earn enough to buy all the books and I shall then read them. Then I shall question you two in order to profit from the parts of the books which your words and actions indicate you have not understood.'
wa9j | 195
pj74 | 'And I' said a fourth dervish, who was passing by and had stopped to listen to them, 'I shall study the third dervish in order to see if his vanity has allowed him to see what there is to see, in the books and in the products of the books.'
tv7e | The Sufi may not be able to teach by direct teaching as ordinarily understood, even though people request this teaching.
cicu | It is related by Sheikh Fariduddin Attar* that the great Samnun Muhibb was once asked, on his return from a pilgrimage, to give them a lecture.
m5cf | THE LECTURE
ug1e | When the Sufi spoke, the people were completely unmoved.
txjz | So the Sheikh addressed himself to the candles in the mosque where they were - and it was they which rolled about and burned themselves out. The Sufi drew the parallel to his audience, and left.

jk9f | Idiot's Wisdom
lu5d | Q. Can you say something about your book Wisdom of the Idiots; how the tales and quotations work?
mw2y | A: The great fraternity of Sufis claims these three things:
kba4 | That the Sufi teaching leads to a realm of higher human en- lightenment;
lxpp | That whatever its changing outward forms, Sufism is timeless. It may be said to have existed always.
xvte | That the aim of Sufi teaching is to provoke experience towards higher knowledge, not simply to supply information or to deal in emotional stimuli.
3qkr | Sufism has perfected, among other techniques, a characteristic teaching method which is almost unknown outside the ranks of the initiates of the Way. This method, called Diagrammatic of Im- pression Tales, is contained in the special use made by Sufis of oral and other literature.
5y46 | Sufi stories, though they may seem on the surface to purvey a moral, or appear intended to entertain, are not literary forms as these things are commonly understood. They are literature in- cidentally, but teaching-materials primarily. Very many of the classical poets and writers of Persia are avowed Sufis: and their works contain such inner dimensions as those to which I am referring.
9dqf | The Sufi tale, and certain Sufic quotations of other kinds, are designed, then, equally to be appreciated by the cultured, to con- vey information, to instruct and to provide what is called 'a framework for the reception of the illumination' in the mind of the student.
vugf | This book is designed with the intention of preserving in English not only the form but also the Sufi intention of the story.
7d5n | One specific thing which can be said about the Sufi tale is that
22rs | 197
bjpt | its construction is such as to permit the presentation to the mind of a design or series of relationships. When the reader's mind is familiar with this structure, he can understand concepts and ex- periences which have a similar structure, but which operate on a higher level of perception. It could be called the relationship of the blueprint to the finished apparatus.
vkpg | This method, according to Sufi teaching, can yield enlighten- ment to the individual in accordance with his capacity to under- stand. It may also form an essential part of a student's preparation- exercises.
yix9 | The process includes getting beyond the external face of a story, without inhibiting the student's capacity to understand and enjoy its humour or other outward characteristics.
iaod | In Sufi circles it is customary for students to soak themselves in stories set for their study, so that their many meanings can become available as and when they are useful for their develop- ment. This latter stage may at times require the aid of a teaching master, to indicate the time and place of such development.
t8jd | It is for these reasons that, in old-fashioned terminology, Sufi tales are said to 'imprison a priceless secret', which is 'released by the power of a teaching master'.
nz5q | To analyse these special tales deprives them of their instrumental value: just as taking a hammer to pieces would mean that it would cease to be a hammer. The tales have been used from immemorial antiquity as the bearers of knowledge and the instru- ments of understanding. But they have to be experienced aright Here is one of the few which help in this experience, and no more can be said about the matter:
a2fr | THE JOURNEY
hm2f | A man was on a journey with a Sufi teacher when night fell, and both were tired and hungry. The master asked at a humble house for food and the tenant, a poor man, gave them everything he had.
rrgl | In the morning, the Sufi said: 'Blessings upon you and your house,' and the two travellers started on their way.
yf3c | After they had gone a few steps, the disciple said:
ptp0 | 198
qtyd | 'We have surely not recompensed this man for his generosity. Could you not give him more than a mere blessing?'
ju7r | 'He has had enough. More would not be better' said the master.
ggbe | But the soft-hearted disciple hung his head and with as much politeness as he could exercise, he insisted that 'all are bound to do all they can for others ... '
vefl | 'Very well,' said the Sufi, 'I shall let you see what happens.'
k6et | He went back and called their host, saying to him:
mw5f | 'A treasure is buried in your garden. It is under that apple tree. Dig it up and flourish.'
m1ik | The two set off again, and they wandered for a year. It so happened that they were passing the same way again, hungry and tired, when they saw that the house was no longer there. It had been replaced by a palace. The formerly kindly tenant was now a great lord, and everyone around was suffering from his tyranny.
aj2w | 'What do you say now?' asked the teacher.
xhz8 | 'I understand what has happened,' said his disciple. 'But if you knew that this would happen, why did you do as I asked: in fact causing this man to become an oppressor?"
aqos | The master waved his hand; and the disciple saw that they were back in the conditions of a year before. No trace of the tyrant remained: they were looking at the smiling face of the humble cottager, waving them goodbye. It was at that moment that the disciple realised that the Sufi teacher had vanished. He has not found him since; and that was many years ago.

yrjp | Attacking Fires
hzcm | Q: In an article in a literary journal, someone has said that you get on a hobby-horse, attacking scholars. Is this true, and if not true, what are you doing?
dz5o | A: It is not only what I am doing which interests you, but what others (people in one or two literary journals) are doing. I am not an expert on them; but after someone tried to demolish me on one occasion, a well-known scholar who suffers a lot from this kind of circus sent me this, 'The Non-entity's Prayer' :-
m2rl | O Lord, make me successful enough to be attacked! But if I cannot have this, let me remain unsuccessful enough to retain the delights of attacking others !
ek0a | If you see a fireman rushing to put out a blaze, and you shout, 'Look at that man on his hobby-horse again, attacking fires!', this luckily neither stops him nor prevents other people from realising that there may be something wrong with you instead. You should also note, if you will, that in the scholarly world itself, my activi- ties seem to be well known and well understood. You should not only look at the person who is being attacked-you should look also at the attacker and form your own opinions as best you can. Although it has taken a decade and a half, there is no lack of both advanced and respected scholars to understand and support our traditional and well-tried 'attack' method as salutary and justified. Can you say the same for the few whom you are quoting?
e4tl | I have criticised unworthy and shallow scholars only. That certain academics seem to think that I mean them personally is to be interpreted by a psychologist, not by me.
voil | If you look at the thing in isolation, of course you will get a distorted picture. Scholars delight in attacking one another; and the surest way of becoming established in certain fields is to get attacked as 'no scholar*, which is a jargon word used by scholars
24g5 | 200
j1i2 | about each other.
22xo | The real scholars have a sense of humour which the shallow ones haven't. I'll never forget the occasion when a prominent literary figure was introduced to a meeting with the words, 'I have pleasure in presenting Dr. Bloggs, who has been assailed in almost every serious periodical in his field for nearly twenty years!'
ye4p | There was thunderous applause.
xdal | Rumi often points out, as do many other Sufi writers, that being an expert is not necessarily the best way to profit from something.
i4yy | THE STRONG MAN IN PAIN
3e6g | In a story related by Saadi (The Orchard: On Acceptance) a doctor visited a strong man who was writhing in pain. His opinion was that since the man had been eating vine-leaves, it would be surprising if he lasted the night. But, continues Saadi, it was the physician who died that very night. That was forty years before - and the athlete still lived!
p9wt | Scholars and specialists have the problem that subjectivity can affect their thinking. Like the doctor, they may themselves suffer through their lack of knowledge: for it seems unlikely that the physician suspected that his own death was so near-in spite of being so confident about the death of another.
bg6v | The Prophet Mohammed is reported to have said that the ink of the scholar is holier than the blood of the martyr. In spite of this, Sufis have for many centuries not shrunk from assailing shallow scholars and those who are really pseudo-scholars, wherever they are to be found. If to do this is to be on a hobby-horse, I am honoured to be counted as one who follows so noble an ex- ample.
ek18 | But, in any case, you are a little out of date. The battle has raged away from where I sit. Some scholars attacked me, then others defended me. The first lot called the second shallow, and now they are fighting it out among themselves. I have no part in this controversy, since it is between third parties.

yyzt | A Bridge and its Use
7lvc | IT will seem improbable, yet it is no exaggeration to say that people ignore, are unaware of or even sneer at materials which could be their only hope of escaping from circular thinking.
rt7z | I have learned more from people, things and ideas which are by many considered irrelevant, slight or even worthless, than from much more advertised and crudely emphasized materials.
wpui | People who cannot or will not approach these sources of know- ledge may accept them when they have been put in a manner which they are prepared to accept. This indicates the serious limitation on learning imposed by so many people's refusal to look at anything which seems to them to be unsuitable, judged from its outward face.
23tt | But this is only the first part of a process. You can 'popularise' or make palatable, but at some point you must direct attention to the original thing.
v3cv | If we have to act as a bridge, we must fulfil the function of a bridge, which is to conduct from one side of something to another side.
o6hl | DIMENSIONS OF A FOOT
pv9r | I remember the case of one person who was able to understand this, and hence to become sensitive to the existence and operation of a Sufi school imperceptible to others, by simply digesting the statement of Rumi, in Fihi ma Fihi:
3ujw | 'I am a shoemaker, with much leather. But I do the cutting and the stitching according to the dimensions of the foot'

09tz | Deterioration of Studies
ncf7 | Q: How do studies deteriorate?
