        "content": "c6hh | A more interpretable metric for fit is Mean Absolute Deviance -- the average of the absolute values of the differences between observed values and predicted values. We do not use it as a heuristic because it leads to overfitting. We include it as a measure of the improvement in the model fit.\ny7ea | Figure four illustrates A star search with AIC as the heuristic. The original model is evaluated and AIC is computed. The model is then split into a few new models by incorporating the factors. AICs are computed from each of the new models. A star selects the best one, the shaded node with value five thousand three hundred one, for the next model generation. A star does not always go down. It may go up to select a model, the shaded node with value five thousand three hundred twelve, to expand if all the new models have worse heuristic scores than a previous model has. After several expansions, it finds a best node with the lowest AIC value.\nnav4 | Five Experiments and Results\ngem8 | Five point one Experiment One\ne8nr | This experiment addresses the question -- How can we describe learning behavior in terms of an existing cognitive model? Specifically, we want to find out the learning rate and initial difficulty level of each rule, and the initial performance of students, given the data. The question is answered by fitting the logistic regression model in equation two and getting the coefficients. The coefficient estimates for the skills and students, and the overall model statistics are summarized in table four.\nk78w | The higher the intercept of each skill, the lower the initial difficulty the skill has. The higher the slope of each skill, the faster students learned the skill. Pentagon-area is the hardest skill with the intercept of negative two point one six. Parallelogram-area is the easiest skill with the intercept of two point one four. Three skills have small slopes close to\ng9du | Learning Factors Analysis - A General Method for Cognitive Model Evaluation\nf682 | zero -- Compose-by-addition negative point zero four and Parallelogram-area negative point zero one, Triangle-area point zero three. Parallelogram-area was already mastered with an initial success probability point nine five. It appears that more practice on those skills does not lead to much learning gain. Interestingly, although Pentagon-area is the hardest skill among all, it has the highest learning rate point four five, leading to bigger improvement with more practice.\nli1k | The coefficients for students measure each student's overall performance. The higher the number, the better the student performed. The AIC, BIC and MAD statistics provide a baseline for evaluating alternative models discussed below.\npbea | Five point two Experiment Two\nccpt | This experiment addresses the question -- How can we improve a cognitive model? The question is answered by running LFA on the data including the factors, and searching through the model space. The improved models by LFA with BIC are summarized in table five. The improved models by LFA with AIC is summarized in the interpretation.\n0fpw | LFA suggests better models, which make finer distinctions on some skills in the original model and identify which difficulty factors the subject experts thought would turn out to be psychologically important. All the better models found by AIC and BIC have better, that is lower, statistical scores than those of the original. For the best BIC model, its BIC is reduced by thirty-seven, and AIC by sixty-two. The fit of the new model, as measured by MAD, is reduced by point zero one two. The best AIC model reduces AIC by an even larger amount of eighty-three, and increases BIC by eighteen. Its MAD is reduced by point zero two.\ndqn8 | The improved skills common to most of the better models are Compose-by-multiplication, Compose-by-addition, Circle-area, and Triangle-area. We will discuss a few examples here.\ncop0 | All the new models suggest splitting Compose-by-multiplication into two skills - Cmarea and CMsegment, making a distinction of the geometric quantity being\nlhkq | multiplied. By examining the positions of these problems in the curriculum, CMarea at the forty-third step and CMsegement at the ninetieth. As seen in table six, although the final probability of CMarea is high point nine six, the initial probability of CMsegment is low point three two. This sudden drop in the success probability at later steps corresponds to a significant blip in the learning curve as illustrated in figure two. The distinction between different geometric quantities suggests treating the original skill differently. LFA successfully identified the blip without the need of visually inspecting learning curves.\n82ju | The subject experts thought embedding a shape into another shape would increase the difficulty of a skill and identified a factor \"Embed\", hoping LFA could make a distinction on it. LFA split these two skills by Embed in all the top AIC models. The three probabilities of CAalone and CAembed are shown in table seven. Does Embed make finding the circle area harder? Note that problems with CAembed are introduced later in the curriculum after students have had significant practice with CAalone, about the time CAalone has reached the average probability of point eight one. At this point, CAembed has an initial probability of point seven one, indicating an increase in difficulty.\ny2qo | Five point three Experiment Three\n1piq | In experiment two, LFA improved the original model by splitting skills. Experiment three addresses model improvement even further -- Will some skills be better merged than if they are separate skills? Can LFA recover some elements of truth if we search from a merged model, given difficulty factors?\n7fqw | We merged some skills in the original model to remove some of the distinctions, which are represented as the difficulty factors. Circle-area and Circle-radius are merged into one skill Circle; Circle-circumference and Circle-diameter into Circle- CD; Parallelogram-area and Parallelogram-side into Parallelogram; Pentagon-area and Pentagon-side into Pentagon; Trapezoid-area, Trapezoid-base, Trapezoid-height into Trapezoid. The new merged model has eight skills -- Circle, Circle-CD, Compose-by-addition, Compose-by-multiplication, Parallelogram, Pentagon, Trapezoid, Triangle.\nrhaz | Then we substituted the original skill names with the new skill name in the data, ran LFA including the factors, and had the A star algorithm search through the model space. The improved models by LFA with BIC are summarized in table eight. The improved models by LFA with AIC are summarized in the interpretation.\nwak1 | Learning Factors Analysis - A General Method for Cognitive Model Evaluation\nwtfz | LFA fully recovered three skills, Circle, Parallelogram, Triangle, suggesting the distinctions made in the original model are necessary. LFA partially recovered two skills, Triangle, Trapezoid, suggesting that some original distinctions are necessary and some are not. LFA did not recover one skill, Circle-CD, suggesting that the original distinctions might not be necessary. LFA recovered one skill, Pentagon, in a different way, suggesting the original distinction may not be as significant as the distinction caused by another factor. We discuss a few examples here.\nqy1i | In BIC model one, Circle is split into Circle area and Circle radius. The other two BIC models and all the AIC models split it into Circle backward and Circle forward, which are equivalent to Circle area and Circle radius because of the one-to-one relationship between forward and area and between backward and radius. Thus, LFA fully recovers the Circle skills.\n1k9e | None of the models recovered Circle-CD. This suggests that it may not be necessary to have two separate skills for Circle-circumference and Circle-Diameter. It appears that once students learn the formula circumference equals n diameter, they can fairly easily apply it in the forward or backward direction.",
