        "content": "aq7b | It is possible to modify Algorithm one to improve upon the convergence rate of Theorem three point three, albeit under stronger assumptions. This is done in Algorithm two where, by appropriate use of curvature information, we can obtain an improved complexity rate. Algorithm two shares the same inactive/active sets, line search strategies, and projection based feasibility with Algorithm one. There are, however, some main differences. A key distinction lies in the certification of strictly positive curvature nine rather than strongly positive curvature, i.e., unlike Algorithm one where we set bar varsigma greater than zero, in Algorithm two we set the NPC tolerance to bar varsigma equals zero. Another notable difference is the introduction of Type two steps. Type two steps set the active portion of the step to zero and occur when the active set optimality conditions seven a and seven b are satisfied otherwise Type one steps, i.e., steps similar to Algorithm one, are used but the inactive set tolerance seven c is unsatisfied. Because the active set termination conditions are satisfied, removing the active portion of the step is not expected to significantly impede the algorithm's progress. By the same token, we can analyse Type two steps using second-order curvature information, similar to the unconstrained Newton-MR algorithm, without having to account for the curvature related to the projected gradient portion of the step. Additionally, to achieve an improved rate over Algorithm one, MINRES inexactness tolerance must scale with epsilon sub k in Algorithm two.\nd9lc | For our analysis, we need additional assumptions including the Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian.\ncciv | Assumption three point five. There exists zero less than or equal to L sub H less than infinity that for all X,\nb47m | Y belonging to the set of positive real numbers to the power of D, norm of H of X minus H of Y is less than or equal to L sub H norm of X minus Y. Additionally, we make some regularity assumptions on the output of the MINRES iterations.\n3va3 | Assumption three point six. There exists a constant omega greater than zero, independent of X, such that the NPC direction from MINRES, P equals r to the power of T minus one, satisfies\n900o | Norm of r to the power of T minus one is greater than or equal to omega norm of G. We note that a lower bound for the relative residual is available directly prior to termination. In fact, recall that if an NPC direction is returned, the termination condition ten must not yet be satisfied. In this case, Assumption three point one and Lemma A. one together imply that norm of r to the power of T minus one is greater than or equal to eta norm of G divided by the square root of eta squared plus L sub G squared. For Algorithm one, this lower bound is directly utilised to establish convergence with no requirement for Assumption three point six. However, for Algorithm two, N depends on epsilon sub K, which could lead us to believe that the lower bound\n4am3 | Algorithm two Newton-MR TMP (Improved Rate)\nggbb | One: Input Initial point X sub zero greater than or equal to zero, active set tolerance delta sub K, optimality epsilon sub K epsilon sub K, MINRES inexactness tolerance eta equals epsilon sub K theta and theta greater than zero, search parameter rho less than one half, NPC tolerance\n51t4 | Bar varsigma equals zero.
