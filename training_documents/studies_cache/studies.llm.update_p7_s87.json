Predominantly mainland regions that were significantly underrepresented compared to other regions were Antarctica and South Sea Islands (compared to North and Central America, diff equals zero point one nine one, P equals zero point zero three), and Central Africa (compared to North and Central America,\nym66 | diff equals zero point one five nine, P equals zero point zero three one). Topics of SES investigation\nl0a3 | A word cloud analysis extracted five hundred eighteen terms that were used more than five times in two thousand one hundred ninety-eight of four thousand four hundred seventy-nine place-based studies with author-provided key words. We subsequently searched all abstracts and key words of the full dataset of articles, four thousand four hundred seventy-nine studies, for the identified key words. Searching the full dataset, and combining some key terms, changed the prominence of key terms slightly. In the final analysis, the top twenty terms differed significantly, chi squared equals five thousand three hundred twenty-six point three seven seven, DF equals twenty-five, P is less than zero point zero zero zero one, in the frequency with which they were used in the literature. The terms that were most frequently encountered in author key words were variations of \"policy\" (thirty point eight percent of publications), \"trade\" (twenty three point eight percent), \"conservation\" (twenty two point three percent), \"adaptation\" (twenty two point three percent), \"land use change\" (twenty one point nine percent), \"water\" (twenty point two percent), \"forest loss\" (nineteen point nine percent), \"sustainability\" (eighteen point eight percent) and \"urban\" (eighteen point eight percent) and \"governance and institutions\" (seventeen point five percent).\nu8nw | Methods used\nl2v9 | We grouped three hundred eleven methods, reduced from an initial list of six hundred thirty-two, into twenty-seven categories. Frequency of use in two thousand seven hundred forty-two significantly between categories, chi squared equals four thousand two hundred thirty-one point zero six eight, DF equals twenty-six, P value is less than zero point zero zero one. Spatial mapping and analysis (twenty-seven point five percent), historical profiling and reconstruction (fifteen point seven percent), interviews\nafbe | used method categories. \"Historical profile and reconstruction,\" \"futures analysis,\" \"spatial mapping and analysis,\" \"livelihood and vulnerability analysis,\" \"impact\n78r8 | analysis,\" \"network analysis,\" \"participatory modeling and planning,\" and \"decision analysis\" were the categories that were most frequently associated with the twenty most identified focus topics.\n320g | Methods addressing complexity features\ntp8g | Table four shows how well each method category scores in terms of its ability to account for each characteristic of complexity, zero being \"usually not well\" and \"x\" being \"usually well,\" along with a justification for each scoring decision. We judged \"futures analysis,\" \"comparative case study analysis,\" \"behavioral analysis,\" \"decision analysis,\" \"games,\" \"systems scoping,\" \"participatory modeling and planning,\" \"state-and-transition analysis,\" \"historical profiling and reconstruction,\" \"discourse analysis,\" and \"facilitated dialogues\" to be method categories that usually address all six features of CAS, mean score equals one. Method categories \"optimization analysis,\" \"impact analysis,\" \"quantitative pattern recognition,\" and \"statistical analysis\" were reasoned to address features of complexity least well. The features of complexity that were best addressed were \"constituted relationally,\" followed by \"contextual\" and \"dynamic,\" \"adaptive,\" \"complex causality\" and \"radically open.\"\ngxfd | DISCUSSION\ns2v1 | Our study provides insights on trends in the SES research field in terms of the terminology used, journals being published in, the type of research, where it is being done and by whom, topics being investigated, and the methods being used. Although a number of reviews exploring\njkp9 | similar issues have recently been published, our analysis takes a particularly broad view, and specifically focuses on the methods used in SES field through a list of method categories or typologies, also assessing the extent to which they account for the underlying organizing principles of CAS. Here we discuss five broad conclusions from these results, and their implications for advancing SES research.",
