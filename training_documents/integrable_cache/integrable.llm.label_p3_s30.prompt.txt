You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

awvu | Here, we are interested in the quasi-integrable regime, <LATEX>\delta ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\gamma \ll 1 .</LATEX> The first issue is the determination of the mean free path <LATEX>\ell .</LATEX> In the HPG with a diatomic mass arrange- ment, <LATEX>\ell</LATEX> corresponds to the average space travelled by a single velociton before the collisions induce a sizeable change of its original velocity. Given the mass arrange- ment, the collision types <LATEX>\left( m _ { 1 } , m _ { 2 } \right) \mathrm { a n d } \left( m _ { 2 } , m _ { 1 } \right)</LATEX> alternate and it is thereby appropriate to look at velocity changes every second iterate <LATEX>\left( u \rightarrow u ^ { \prime } \rightarrow u ^ { \prime \prime } \right) .</LATEX> From Eq. (6)
on9b | <LATEX>u ^ { \prime \prime } = \left( 1 - \delta \right) u ^ { \prime } + \delta \chi _ { 2 } = \left( 1 - \delta ^ { 2 } \right) u + \delta \left( \chi _ { 2 } - \chi _ { 1 } \right) + \delta ^ { 2 } \chi _ { 1 }</LATEX> where <LATEX>\chi _ { 1 , 2 }</LATEX> denote the velocities of the quasi-particles en- countered by the velociton u, hereby assumed to be un- correlated Gaussian variables with zero average and vari- ance <LATEX>\langle \chi _ { 1 , 2 } ^ { 2 } \rangle = v ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (neglecting the mass difference between
a8ge | the two particles). To leading order in <LATEX>\delta ,</LATEX> the map can be turned into the stochastic differential equation
h27a | <LATEX>\dot { u } = - \delta ^ { 2 } u + \sqrt { 2 } \delta v \zeta ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\zeta</LATEX> is a unit-variance white noise, while time is mea- sured in <LATEX>2 \tau</LATEX> units, <LATEX>\tau</LATEX> average collision time. As a result, the distribution of <LATEX>u</LATEX> values diffuses, its vari- ance growing initially as <LATEX>D _ { u } = 2 \delta ^ { 2 } v ^ { 2 } t ,</LATEX> so that the time needed for <LATEX>D _ { u }</LATEX> to be approximately equal to <LATEX>v ^ { 2 }</LATEX> is <LATEX>t \approx \tau / \delta ^ { 2 }</LATEX> (in physical time units) and the corresponding mean free path is <LATEX>\ell \approx v \tau / \delta ^ { 2 } .</LATEX> In other words, we expect
pdjh | <LATEX>\theta = 2 .</LATEX> Numerical results have been obtained by implement- ing the standard non-equilibrium procedure <LATEX>\left[ 1 , 2 \right] .</LATEX> Left and right edges are attached to Maxwellian heat baths at temperatures <LATEX>T _ { L } = 6</LATEX> and <LATEX>T _ { R } = 4</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( \Delta T = T _ { L } - T _ { R } \right)</LATEX> and the flux <LATEX>J</LATEX> determined from the average energy ex- changed in the steady state. For the HPG we employ the thermal-wall method as detailed, e.g., in Ref. [36].
xmgs | In Fig. 1(a) we plot the rescaled thermal conductivity <LATEX>\delta ^ { 2 } \kappa</LATEX> of the diatomic HPG, referred to the effective length <LATEX>\xi = L \delta ^ { 2 }</LATEX> [57] (the various curves correspond to different <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> values - <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> decreases from top to bottom). There is clear evidence of a ballistic regime followed by a diffusive one, as accounted for by Eq. (3). For the smaller 0's, Fourier-like trasport persists up to the maximal available <LATEX>L ,</LATEX> while a crossover to the anomalous regime is seen upon increasing <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> (see the uppermost curve). Upon decreasing <LATEX>\delta ,</LATEX> the curves converge from above towards an asymptotic shape, <LATEX>\kappa _ { N } = j _ { N } \left( \xi \right) \xi / \Delta T .</LATEX> In fact, for <LATEX>\delta \rightarrow 0</LATEX> and fixed <LATEX>\xi ,</LATEX> L increases <LATEX>\left( L = \xi / \delta ^ { 2 } \right) ,</LATEX> so that the corresponding <LATEX>J _ { A } \left( L \right)</LATEX> contribution becomes increasingly negligible.
bd9h | Then, <LATEX>j _ { \Lambda }</LATEX> is estimated from the data for the smallest perturbation amplitude (since <LATEX>J _ { A }</LATEX> is practically negligible over the explored length range). The simple formula (4)
m047 | proves remarkably accurate: see the solid upper curve in Fig. 2, to be compared with the circles, which represent the numerical HPG results.
gy8c | As a second test, we consider the diatomic Toda model [36]. For large energy densities, most of its dynamical properties are basically equal to the HPG [58] and we thus expect again <LATEX>\ell \approx \delta ^ { - 2 } ,</LATEX> i.e. <LATEX>\theta = 2</LATEX> 2. At lower ener- gies, one should estimate the soliton scattering rates due to mass inhomogeneities; however there are no reason to expect a different scaling behavior. Indeed, the typi- cal thermalization time is of order <LATEX>\delta ^ { - 2 }</LATEX> in a wide energy range [59]. The conductivities taken from Ref. [36], are reported in Fig. 1(b) after a proper rescaling. The data collapse confirms the validity of our arguments.
y4mj | Finally, we have considered the Toda model with con- servative noise. In this case, it is natural to argue that the mean free path scales as the inverse of the collision rate, <LATEX>\ell \sim \gamma ^ { - 1 } .</LATEX> This intuition is confirmed by the data reported in Fig. 1(c), where we observe the same scenario as for the previous models, after setting <LATEX>\theta = 1</LATEX> 1. For small <LATEX>\gamma ,</LATEX> <LATEX>j _ { N }</LATEX> converges again towards a function which asymptotically decays as <LATEX>1 / \xi .</LATEX> However, the heuristic formula (4) is not comparably accurate: it is necessary to add a correction term to reproduce the observed data as shown in Fig. 2 (see triangles <LATEX>\mathrm { V S } .</LATEX> the corresponding solid curve).
vpgq | So far we have tested the structure of the first ad- dendum in Eq. (2), by studying a regime where the second contribution is negligible. What about the sec- ond addendum? Once <LATEX>j _ { N }</LATEX> has been determined, one can proceed by estimating the anomalous component as <LATEX>J _ { A } \left( L \right) = J \left( L , \varepsilon \right) - j _ { N } \left( L \varepsilon ^ { \theta } \right) .</LATEX> The data in Fig. 3 indicates that <LATEX>J _ { A }</LATEX> exhibits the expected anomalous scaling already for system sizes where the direct estimates are strongly affected by the diffusive component. For the HPG the fitted slope, about -0.66, corresponds to <LATEX>\eta = 0 . 3 3 ,</LATEX> in ex- cellent agreement with the KPZ prediction <LATEX>\eta = 1 / 3 .</LATEX> For Toda we obtain <LATEX>\eta = 0 . 5 2 ,</LATEX> consistent with Ref. [35] and even closer to <LATEX>\eta = 1 / 2 ,</LATEX> the value rigorously proven for harmonic models with momentum-conserving noise [40- 42]. We thus conclude that the measurements are in full agreement with the crossover scenario from diffusive to hydrodynamic behavior proposed above.
ousl | The same scenario is expected to emerge in the pres- ence of generic momentum-conserving perturbations of the Toda chain, such as a potential of the form <LATEX>\varepsilon W \left( q \right) .</LATEX> In fact, in this case, it has been already noticed that the energy-flux correlation decays over a time scale inversely proportional to a power of <LATEX>\varepsilon</LATEX> [53]. A preliminary evidence of a diffusive regime for small <LATEX>\&</LATEX> was also given in Ref. [60].
m4ju | More in general, we argue that the crossover from normal to anomalous regimes of the <LATEX>\mathrm { F P U T } - \alpha \beta</LATEX> model [37, 38] is fully accounted for by the above described sce- nario. Indeed, the <LATEX>\mathrm { F P U T } - \alpha \beta</LATEX> (at low enough energies) can be regarded as a perturbed Toda chain over very long time scales, on which the Toda actions are only weakly perturbed [61]. We surmise that other model potentials
a0mb | should display the same phenomenology, if their form is "close enough" to
ki8m | <LATEX>U _ { T } .</LATEX> What can we say about the simplest model of a perturbed harmonic chain? This textbook case de- serves a special consideration. Numerical analysis of the FPUT-3 model at very low energy, i.e. below the strong stochasticity threshold, does not reveal any sig- nature of an intermediate diffusive regime, but rather a direct crossover from ballistic to anomalous regimes [62]. More compelling evidence of the absence of a diffusive regime comes from the study of the harmonic chain with conservative noise [41] in the limit of vanishing noise, i.e. <LATEX>\gamma \rightarrow 0 .</LATEX> It has been found analytically [40] and confirmed numerically [63] that <LATEX>J _ { A } \left( L , \varepsilon \right) ,</LATEX> exhibits a singular depen- dence for <LATEX>\varepsilon \rightarrow 0</LATEX> (here <LATEX>\gamma \rightarrow 0</LATEX> in the form of a divergence of the coefficient <LATEX>c _ { A }</LATEX> in Eq. (5), <LATEX>c _ { A } \approx \gamma ^ { - 1 / 2 } ,</LATEX> which im- plies that <LATEX>J _ { A }</LATEX> prevails over <LATEX>J _ { N }</LATEX> across the entire range of system sizes.
km8w | Hence, the different behavior displayed by weakly per- turbed harmonic oscillators can be traced back to a diver- gence of the anomalous component, which is itself a con- sequence of the nonlinearity of the dynamical equations. While this counter-intuitive phenomenon requires further clarifications, it does not however jeopardize the general scaling theory developed in this Letter, which provides a convincing explanation of the seemingly normal diffusion observed in several models of nonlinear chains.
