You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

byu8 | To assess the impact of <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { c }</LATEX> on the Kok effect, <LATEX>C _ { c }</LATEX> has to be known. To that end, we estimated <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> using all data from com- bined gas exchange and Chl fluorescence measurements. <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> is known to vary with temperature (Bernacchi et al., 2002), but whether <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> varies with <LATEX>\widehat { C _ { i } \mathrm { o r } \mathrm { w i t } }</LATEX> <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> is uncertain. Further- more, recent literature suggests the necessity to dissect mesophyll resistance into its components (Tholen et al., 2012) and to con- sider the intracellular arrangements of organelles (Yin & Struik, 2017; Ubierna et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2020). Here we consider three <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> modes: mode i assumes that <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> varies only with temper- ature, but not with either <LATEX>C _ { i }</LATEX> or <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> mode ii assumes that gm varies with all these factors; and mode iii is similar to mode ii but uses an additional factor <LATEX>m</LATEX> that lumps subresistance propor- tions and several intracellular properties of mesophyll organelles (Yin et al., 2020). For mode i, we estimated <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> by fitting, the NRH-A method based on the non-rectangular hyperbolic equa- tion for CO2-assimilation, described by Yin & Struik (2009) to all data (including A-C; curves). Like photosynthetic rate, <LATEX>g _ { m }</LATEX> has generally an optimum response to temperature (e.g. Bernacchi et al., 2002; Warren & Dreyer, 2006; but with caution, see von Caemmerer & Evans, 2015), and we assumed that this response followed a normal distribution function, with an optimum tem- perature of 30℃: <LATEX>g _ { m } = g _ { m 3 0 } \exp \left\{ - \left[ \left( T - 3 0 \right) / \Omega \right] ^ { 2 } \right\} ,</LATEX> which has a minimum number of parameters to estimate. We incorporated these relationships into the NRH-A method to fit parameter <LATEX>\Omega .</LATEX> For modes ii and iii, we used an equation described by Yin et al. (2009), <LATEX>g _ { m } = \delta \left( A + R _ { d } \right) / \left( C _ { c } - \Gamma ^ { * } \right) ,</LATEX> which can semi-empirically accommodate the response (if observed) of <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> to <LATEX>I _ { \mathrm { i n c } } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>C _ { i } ,</LATEX> <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and temperature. Here, it is the unitless coefficient <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> that is an explicit parameter to be estimated, and <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> represents the carboxylation resistance : mesophyll resistance ratio (Yin et al., 2020). For each mode, the simultaneously estimated parameters together with <LATEX>g _ { \mathrm { m } }</LATEX> or <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> were: the calibration factor(s) that converts Chl fluorescence-

(2002) as the activation energy for <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * }</LATEX> (using other activation-energy estimates (e.g. Walker et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2014) had little impact on our calculated <LATEX>\Gamma ^ { * } / C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> ratios). In view of the reasoning of Farquhar & Busch (2017), we used <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { D 1 } }</LATEX> of each curve as input for the <LATEX>R a</LATEX> term of the model in fitting. The fitting procedures for three modes were implemented using the GAUSS method in PROC NLIN of SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA), and the SAS codes can be obtained upon request. The SAS output gave the fitted <LATEX>A</LATEX> for each measurement point, with which <LATEX>C _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> was then solved from the model of Farquhar et al. (1980) as:
xnth | <LATEX>C _ { c } = \Gamma ^ { * } \left[ J / 4 + 2 \left( A + R _ { d } \right) \right] / \left[ / 4 - \left( A + R _ { d } \right) \right] .</LATEX> Results

d6r4 | decelerating decrease' scenario also generated the Kok effect but without the abrupt break point (Fig. 3d). For an 'accelerating decrease' scenario, <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> was also progressively suppressed by light, but this scenario generated an A-Labs curve where the slope did not decrease but increased (Fig. 3e), thereby being unable to reproduce the Kok curve. Finally, an 'abrupt suppression' sce- nario cannot be ruled out, but this scenario generated two linear discontinued segments with the same slope (Fig. 3f), thereby being unable to reproduce the Kok effect either.
9mrz | As illustrated in Fig. 3, the difference in scenarios also has implications for the estimation of <LATEX>\Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } } .</LATEX> Only in the second 'bi- linear' scenario (Fig. 3c) and the abrupt-suppression scenario (Fig. 3f) can <LATEX>\Phi _ { \mathrm { C O 2 } }</LATEX> be reliably estimated by the Kok method as the slope of the <LATEX>A - I _ { a b s }</LATEX> curve above the break point. For other scenarios, the slope represents the combined yield of photosyn- thesis and of the component of light suppression of <LATEX>R _ { 4 } .</LATEX> In fact, it is the scenario of Fig. 3(c) that the Kok method relies on to esti- mate <LATEX>R _ { \mathrm { d } }</LATEX> and
