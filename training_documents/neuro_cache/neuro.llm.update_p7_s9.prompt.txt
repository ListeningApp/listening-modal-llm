You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

mror | A crucial aspect of this logic is that the patterns of acti- vation arising from the two strategies must actually be different. It is not enough to show that, relative to a base- line, in one task areas X-Y are activated, whereas in another task areas P-Q are activated. 'Activation' is a continuous variable, and sub-threshold activation is common. Thus, even though activation in an area might be significant in one task (relative to baseline), and not in another, there might be no difference between the two when they are directly compared. Thus, one must compare the tasks directly, not simply rely on visual comparisons of what was and was not over the threshold under separate conditions.
zlxc | 3. WHEN ARE SPECIFIC TYPES OF INFORMATION PROCESSING USED?
k0bw | One virtue of beginning by asking questions about how information processing is implemented in the brain is that the answers can later be used as a basis for asking and answering other types of questions. We can distinguish two broad classes of questions that can be asked about when specific processing is used. First, one can ask simply whether a given process or structure was drawn upon
aq5a | while subjects engaged a particular ability. Second, 'when' need not be a constant: one can ask how practice, fatigue or some other state can alter when a particular process or structure is used. We explore both classes of questions below.
sc5y | (a) Inferring processes from brain activation
0yab | Two distinct types of logic of inference can be used to infer that a particular process or structure is used when subjects perform a specific task.
w95z | (i) Inferring processing from the presence of activation
0i1k | It is commonplace in the discussion sections of neuro- imaging studies to see post-hoc interpretations of proces- sing based on the set of areas found to be activated. In the ideal case, if one knows which processes or structures are implemented in a given part of the brain, one can argue subsequently that activation in that area while subjects perform a particular task is prima facie evidence that these processes or structures were drawn upon while subjects performed that task. To the extent that a particular process or structure has been identified with a particular neuroanatomical locus, this logic of inference is defen- sible. For example, the function of area Ml is understood well enough to allow us to infer that if it is activated, then motor processes were present as one performed the task (assuming that it can be shown that the activation is not an artefact of the baseline comparison).
dqlg | For example, it is known, largely from animal research (see, for example, Checetto & Saper 1990), that the ante- rior insula is the major cortical recipient of input from the autonomic nervous system. We therefore asked whether visual mental images of strongly aversive pictures could induce such feedback from the body; it is well- known that mental images can engage the autonomic nervous system (see, for example, Lang et al. 1980). Kosslyn et al. (1996a) asked subjects to visualize either very aversive pictures (e.g. of a baby with a large tumour over one eye, or a battered body) or neutral pictures (e.g. of a truck, a lamp), mostly drawn from Lang's set (Lang et al. 1988). PET scanning was conducted while subjects visualized each picture and determined whether a state- ment was an appropriate description of it; the statements were selected to require imagery to evaluate, and thus to encourage subjects to visualize the pictures (e.g. 'the baby has a tumour over his left eye'). When rCBF in the aversive condition was compared with that in the neutral condition, additional activation was documented bilater- ally in the anterior insula, as expected. (Other areas, such as Area 17, were also activated, but this is not to the present point.) This led us to infer that images of aversive objects can engage the bodily structures that in turn feed back to activate this area.
p6pq | We can discover whether the structures or processes implemented in a particular area have a functional role in conferring an ability by studying the effects of disrupting that area. In this case, patients who had damage to areas that have no essential role in the ability of interest would still retain the ability (assuming that they are alert enough to be engaged in the tasks used to assess the ability); similarly, TMS delivered to the area would not disrupt this ability. In contrast, if an area does indeed underlie a particular ability, the ability should be
zse6 | impaired after both damage to the area and temporary disruption of the area induced by TMS (Pascual-Leone et al. 1997; Kosslyn et al. 1999). However, without such data, there is no way to know whether any given area implements a structure of process that contributes to the performance of the task of interest.
p2n3 | In addition, a problem with the logic of inferring proces- sing from activation is that a given part of the brain can implement more than one process. This could conceivably be true even for highly constrained sensory and motor cortices; we simply do not know enough to exclude the possibility of multiple roles for any piece of cortical real estate. Thus, the activation of a given brain area does not necessarily implicate specific processes that were previously found to activate it; some other process could in fact be at work. The finding of activation in a particular brain area during a particular task can therefore only be taken as either (i) the basis for the hypothesis that a specific process or structure is at work (to be tested, in part, by observing the effects of disrupting the area), or (ii) one piece of converging evidence for such an inference.
ohh7 | (ii) Using variations in activation to predict performance
vbni | A completely different logic of inference can be used to discover whether a specific process or structure contributes to how well one can make use of a specific ability. First, however, it is important to be clear on what question is being asked here. We are no longer asking whether a process or structure (implemented in an area) confers an ability. Instead, we are asking whether variations in the efficacy of a structure or process are related to variations in the performance of the relevant tasks. That is, we can divide processes and structures into two general types. The first type of processes or structures are not taxed by the task, to the extent that, if they func- tion at all, they function well enough to allow one to perform a class of tasks. The second type are the 'rate- limiting steps'. They are taxed when one draws on a particular ability; the more effectively they function, the better one will perform the relevant tasks. By analogy, keys on a keyboard are designed so that minimal strength is required to press them down; therefore, finger strength in excess of this amount is irrelevant (and hence finger strength would be analogous to the first type of process). However, the ease of typing a sequence of letters depends on their arrangement, and setting up motor commands to execute some sequences is difficult; thus, better ability to programme complex motor movements will lead to better performance on this task (this is a rate-limiting step).
dgcw | For example, in the task of Kosslyn et al. (1996b), subjects were asked to visualize, with eyes closed, capital letters. After 4s they heard a probe (such as 'straight side') and were to decide, as quickly and accurately as possible, whether the visualized letter had that property. Both response times and accuracy rates were recorded as the subjects performed the task while being PET-scanned. After both behavioural and rCBF data had been collected from 16 subjects, the rCBF values in each brain were normalized to the same mean. For each brain, we then measured deviations from the mean for each region of interest (ROI) found previously to be activated during visual imagery (as summarized in §2). These areas were previously interpreted as implementing the functions
