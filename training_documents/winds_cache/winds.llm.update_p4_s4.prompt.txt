You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

A further 186 individuals washed up on Cable Beach were measured for maximum bell width on 5 October 2012 by collecting all jellyfish from an area 4 by 8 m quadrat at 17.933556°S, 122.208500°E. Biomass in terms of wet weight to size was determined as above, and dry weight and ash-free dry weight (AFDW) were determined by drying samples of jellyfish tissue (principally from the bell) of known wet weight in a Labconco Freezone 2.5 freeze dryer at -40℃ until constant weight was achieved and then reweighing before ashing at 450℃ for 4.5 h and reweighing (Larson, 1986). Jellyfish tissue was not rinsed in freshwater before drying, so some residual salt may have remained when dried. The mean ratios of wet to dry and wet to AFDW were then used to calculate biomass for the full-size range of

xxr8 | jellyfish sampled. Total organic carbon, total nitrogen content and stable isotopes (13C and 15N) were assessed using freeze-dried tissue. Samples were analysed for 815N and 813C, using a continuous flow system consisting of a Delta V Plus mass spectrometer connected with a Thermo Flush 1112 via Conflo IV (Thermo-Finnigan/Germany) following the methods of Paul et al. (2007) and Skrzypek et al. (2010).
rl4j | To determine the biomass of jellyfish washed up on the Cable Beach (Fig. 1iii), we counted all jellyfish in twelve 20-by-1 m transects at six sites on 8 October 2012. The transects were set out in pairs along 2.5 km of beach heading south from a site seaward of the Broome Surf Life Saving Club (BSLSC). The location of the first transect was at 17.932639°S, 122.208833°E. The sites were 500 m apart along the beach, and at each site, two transects were conducted parallel to the shoreline. One transect was near the water's edge, and one transect was near the high-water mark so as to capture the range of densities at each site across the width of the beach. Figure 2iii shows the apparently even distribution of jellyfish across the beach on the day of sampling. The density of jellyfish from both high and low transects was calculated. To calculate total average biomass on the beach, the mean density was calculated from all 12 transects, and this density was converted to wet weight based on the size distribution measured on the same beach 3 days earlier and the relationship between size and wet weight. To enable the density of jellyfish on the full width of beach to be estimated, we used a conservative estimate of 100-m width based in two measurements made from aerial photographs (averaging 115.5 m) of the width of the beach adjacent to the BSLSC (127.5 m) and 3 km to the south (103.5 m). These measurements were made between the high (6.85 m) and low (3.32 m) tide points for 8 October 2012. A more extensive visual survey of jellyfish on the beach was made by driving a 4WD vehicle south from the BSLSC for 5 km to Gantheaume Point (17.970083°S, 122.191000°E) and north for 10 km to Coconut Wells (17.838611ºS, 122.209028°E) (Fig. 1ii). This 15 km survey recorded the southern extent of the strandings, but they may have extended further north as the beach extends a further 7 km to a creek and then a further 13 km north after that. At one-km intervals along with this 15 km section of beach, a visual assessment and photograph along with the GPS position were recorded. This survey confirmed that densities measured over the 2.5 km
vz32 | stretch south of the BSLSC were representative of the entire beach.
ncb0 | To examine for diet, samples of live C. mastigophora were collected (as per the description above) from two locations on 19 September 2012: Offshore of Gantheaume Point at 17.966944°S, 122.178989°E and near Dampier Creek in Roebuck Bay at 17.967536°S, 122.243281°E. The jellyfish were mea- sured (as per above) and placed in plastic bags and then on ice. The method of determining prey items followed that of Browne & Kingsford (2005) except it was necessary to freeze the samples in order to transport them to the laboratory where 14 individuals were thawed over 1-2 h in seawater filtered through What- man® glass microfiber filters (0.6-0.8 um) and then washed in the container to dislodge any prey items adhering to oral arms. Much of the jellyfish disinte- grated during this process but otherwise large pieces of intact jellyfish were removed and washed with a wash bottle containing filtered seawater before all the remaining liquid was filtered through 1 mm and 63 um sieves. The filtrate was fixed in 5% formalin before later being searched under a dissection micro- scope Leica M 205 C, magnification 6.3, objective 10x. Prey items were identified to the lowest taxonomic unit possible by an experienced zooplankton biologist (JS). The method used does not permit gelatinous prey items to be identified.
