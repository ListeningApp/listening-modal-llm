Radical Democracy, Radical Markets\nex5k | However, cautious but increasingly ambitious experimentation seem warranted given the potential of QV to create a truly radical democracy in several senses. First, and most mechanically, QV may also be viewed as individuals receiving votes equal to the square root or radical of the voice credits they spend. Second, QV gets to the roots of what the framers of modern democratic institutions, such as Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Condorcet and Jeremy Bentham, viewed as the aim of democracy: to ensure the state serves the general happiness of the people maximally. Third, QV radically expands the rights of citizens to fully and freely express their political views, liberating them from the straight jacket of one person, one vote influence rationing. In this sense, it shows how mechanism design can suggest fundamental and yet also practical reforms of social institutions.\n9d4o | Yet Vickrey's vision has nearly as much to give to markets for private as public goods. A follower of Henry George, Vickrey was skeptical of private property and the central argument of his one thousand nine hundred sixty-one classic was that auctioning assets ensured their efficient allocation, which Myerson and Satterthwaite show this is impossible beginning from private ownership. One can imagine many assets (other than personal property) being continuously auctioned for rental according to Vickrey's favored English auction, much as occurs with internet advertising slots. However, rather than the revenue being appropriated by a web platform, it could be returned to the public in equal shares as a social dividend, much as envisioned by George. Such a Vickrey Commons would on the one hand take the logic of the free market to its furthest extreme, while on the other hand abolishing private property and most inequality. It is the natural private goods markets analog of the radical market logic of QV.\ncjq2 | As with the direct application of Vickrey's schemes to collective decisions, a Vickrey Commons would face a host of practical challenges and variations on it, such as those proposed by Weyl and Zhang, are of greater practical relevance. Yet as a thought experiment it, along with QV, illustrates the potential to break the deadlocked ideologies of left and right that plague our society. For mechanism designers to\n5esx | realize this potential, they will have to broaden their horizons beyond both narrow applications and impractical theory, to learn to be at once idealistic and pragmatic, to deploy rigor flexibly and to account for sociological, psychological, legal and other factors that they have traditionally shied away from given their analytical intractability. Here we tried to illustrate briefly the challenges and promise of such an approach.\nm5ka | QUADRATIC VOTING",
