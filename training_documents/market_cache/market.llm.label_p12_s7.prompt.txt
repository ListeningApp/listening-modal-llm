You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wcd0 | Figure 2 shows the mean real price per square foot. The data indicate that there is some variation over time between settle- ments in average prices. Las Lomas is the oldest colonia and shows generally lower prices (compared with the other selected sub- divisions) during the 1980s (when prices were low), with a moderate increase in the
caos | 1990s and a drop at the end of the period. Mike's colonia has consistently higher land prices than most settlements throughout, but also shows an increase in the mid 1990s, while Share 52 colonia has the most dramatic 'spike' of all in the mid 1990s. This alerted us to the possibility that the upward peak noted earlier in Figure 1 for the mid 1990s may have derived from the Share 52 data entering the data-set at that time, but further analysis in the colonia revealed that this represented only 5 cases for 1994 and 1995, and that excluding Share 52 data from the overall trend did not change the curve significantly.
qrvy | Local Survey Data and the Determinants of Land Prices
pn9j | Thus far, the analysis has focused exclu- sively upon the larger CRG records, and we now turn to the more detailed data-set de- rived from the questionnaire survey. How- ever, because of the limited sample size, these data are usually analysed for the whole
1pmc | 2633
5z6q | sample, occasionally broken down either by colonia or into two groups-the 'Control Group', most of whom live in Las Lomas, and the 'Study Group' which comprise the other colonias and some (23 cases) from the unplatted area of Las Lomas (Santa Cruz 1 and NW Industrial Park).
yeoh | We will not repeat the findings from the household survey; suffice to say that the household data show an almost identical cyclical pattern in real (1983) prices (see Figure 3, pecked line) to that described above for the larger CRG database with a similar sharp peak in 1994/95. (The full line indicates nominal or unadjusted prices.) Overall, taking the real price of lots and land units from the late 1970s through to late 1990s, prices remained fairly 'flat' over time. Statistically, no correlation was found be- tween rising prices and the progression of years through the 1980s and 1990s, either for all cases combined, or differentiated between the 'Control' and the CRG-intervened 'Study' Groups. However, Control Group lots do appear to be slightly lower in price
b8hf | 2634
hntf | than those of the Study settlements and this is consistent with the generally lower price of land in Las Lomas (where most Control Group households lived) and the earlier pe- riod of that cluster of colonias' development (see also Table 3). Differentiating between the two groups continued to show a lack of any clear relationship between price and yearly progression and, although the corre- lation coefficient is positive (0.114), it is not statistically significant. Moreover, disaggre- gating the data by cohort or period of pur- chase does not seem to make any difference either: there is a low negative correlation for the 1989-94 period, and only if one takes the 1979-94 period does one observe a positive correlation of + 0.157 (significant at the 5 per cent level).
99fo | Tracking prices since CRG intervention (1995 onwards). In summary, the survey data reveal some small hint of a real price in- crease over time, but only for the overall period 1979-94 and not for the rush of lot sales during 1989-94. Between 1995 and 2001, there is a negative correlation between prices-when they actually decline quite sharply (see Figure 3)-as we saw earlier. However, the number of cases is rather
y5r7 | small: examining the price paid for land in the last few years (1995-2001) embracing the period of CRG intervention (1997-2002) we have a total of 35 cases, but with only 3-4 cases each year in the most recent pe- riod. Our conclusions are tentative, therefore. The results (not displayed here) show a sharp decline in 1997, picking up again from 2000 onwards, but not getting back to 1995 and 1996 levels. While it is possible that CRG intervention actually drove prices down- wards, it must be stated this is likely to have been in combination with a number of fac- tors, some of which were alluded to earlier (i.e. less well articulated price-setting, the reduction of scarcity by title clearance and the opening up of a supply of lots that were somehow previously impeded from being sold), but it is not possible to be conclusive.9 Further research is required to track prices for a much larger number of cases since 1997 and to analyse in detail whether the resulting changes are related to CRG intervention and titling. Prima facie it appears that the prom- ise, or the likelihood of title transfers being provided by the CRG, has not had an inflationary impact upon land values: indeed, the trend is in the opposite direction. But in order to be sure, it is necessary to analyse
lrry | more cases exclusively for the post-interven- tion period since 1997 and to conduct further follow-up studies for the period 2001-05. Put simply, although it is probably too soon to ascertain definitively whether title provision has had a significant direct impact upon land prices, our initial assessment is that it has not had a significant effect.
hvhm | The costs and affordability of land acqui- sition in Rio Grande City. Earlier in this article, we observed that Starr County is among the poorest in Texas and we were interested to know how far the land market was constructed in such a way as to ensure that even here land for self-help housing remained affordable. Lot prices and square foot prices are shown in Table 3. The overall trimmed mean (1983) price is $2552 (me- dian = $2122), equaling 45¢ and 42¢ per square foot respectively.10 (In order to ex- press in 2002 values, multiply by 1.735-see Table 3). These costs of land are broadly comparable in unit price terms with other Texas colonias studied using an almost identical methodology (Ward et al., 2000, p. 109). Where those other study colonias showed significantly lower unit prices, it was usually due to their much larger average lot sizes (reducing the overall bid prices). For example, Pueblo Nuevo colonia in Webb County (outside Laredo) had a trimmed mean price of 13¢ per square foot (excep- tionally low), but these were for average lots of almost 1 acre in size; while Sparks colonia in El Paso County had a median cost of 35¢ per sq ft on lots that averaged twice the size of those in Starr County (around 11 000 sq ft compared with 5000 sq ft). Cameron Park in Cameron County-a better point of compari- son, given its Lower Rio Grande Valley loca- tion and similar land properties-had a median of 39¢ per sq ft, with average lot sizes of 7000 sq ft. Thus, we are confident in concluding that Starr County unit land prices are broadly similar to equivalent colonia lots found elsewhere in the border area.
863b | The data show that overall lot prices in Starr County are 'cheaper' (or more afford- able) than those of most other counties and
fj24 | 2635
uz3c | cities due in large part to their smaller unit lot size. For example, compared with Sparks and Cameron Park where the median cost of a lot (in 1983 prices) was $3744 and $3362 respectively, the corresponding median for all the survey settlements in the Rio Grande City study was $2346-more than one-third less. Moreover, as we saw in Figure 2, there is often considerable settlement variation be- tween the survey settlements. In our ques- tionnaire data, the higher prices charged in Mike's colonia have the effect of inflating the overall average considerably (especially given the larger number of data points in that settlement). The averages and median vary somewhat between those in the Control and Study Groups respectively, with Study Group colonias usually being somewhat higher (by $300-400 or 2-3 cents per sq ft). But, as Table 3 shows, prices vary markedly between colonias, with the outliers being Mike's which has a higher trimmed mean (Tx =$3628), and West Alto Bonito, es- pecially if one takes sq ft costs in that colo- nia (around 50 cents per sq ft). In conclusion, while unit land prices are more or less the same in Starr County as in other border counties, the actual cost of purchasing a lot is considerably less. Selling smaller-sized lots in Starr County was the way in which devel- opers sought to adjust supply to the potential demand, ensuring affordability in a region that, as we observed earlier, is an exception- ally poor part of the Texas border.
d5bi | The determinants of land price differentials. The comparison between the 'Control' and 'Study' Groups suggests that neither the presence or absence of title deeds, nor the provision of clear land titles, makes any ap- preciable difference to land prices. Thus, one might reasonably ask, what does make a difference? As an important sidebar analysis, we are interested, therefore, in trying to ex- plain why settlements seem to vary so much in average lot prices. Is it 'location, location, location'-the classic assertion; or is it loca- tion in combination with other physical site characteristics? Alternatively, given that these are poorly serviced communities, does
ba4l | 2636
ffx8 | the actual level of infrastructure provision or community-generated improvements shape the price of land?
s6su | On the face of it, location and proximity to RGC do not appear to play any role at all since prices are highest in Mike's and West Alto Bonito, which are the most distant, while Las Lomas, which is much closer in, has lower lot prices. Nor did any of the colonias have any particular servicing advan- tage at the outset that could explain higher prices, although the expectancy that services might come on line more readily from the mid 1990s might have affected land prices as discussed earlier, but this would only be reflected in those settlements in which lots were sold primarily during this phase. Physi- cal conditions might help to explain the lower cost in B & E, which is steep and relatively inaccessible, tucked away as it is behind another colonia La Puerta No. 2. But West Alto Bonito also has a major negative externality of a (sometimes) flooding arroyo running through it, although buyers would almost certainly not have known this when they purchased, so it probably did not affect the asking price.
y219 | Thus, we need to explore other variables in order to try to explain what influences land price-setting in colonias and we turn here to explanations that are sometimes referred to in the academic literature as 'socially deter- mined' (Ward et al., 1993; Varley, 2002). Interestingly (and unexpectedly for the study researchers), the single best explanation of the variation on lot and unit prices appears to relate to who developed the colonia in the first instance, and the period of development. As we observed earlier, responsibility for developing these colonias rested primarily with two men-Blas Chapa and Elías López. According to the CRG database, Blas Chapa developed almost half (682) of the total lots in the 15 settlements, while Elías was re- sponsible for 18 per cent (254) and they sold 91 lots (6.5 per cent) in partnership. Some 27 per cent of lots were recorded as having been sold by 'others'-either smaller developers or by individuals (re)selling their lots (as traspasos). Moreover, while both Blas Chapa
06ht | and Elías López were actively engaging in lot sales from the late 1970s, either individu- ally or in combination, Elías' major involve- ment only truly kicked in between 1989 and 1994. After 1995-the prohibition on devel- oper sales of this nature-sales are exclu- sively by 'others' (largely traspasos).
v3r2 | Like most colonia developers, Blas Chapa and Elías López were intimately engaged in the planning and sale process, and yet unlike most formal real estate developers they re- tained very close day-to-day ties with the residents, so much so that despite their illegal lot-sale shenanigans they continued to be quite well regarded by those to whom they had sold lots (Blas Chapa especially). Both men felt close personal ties to the settle- ments, so much so that they often named the settlements for themselves or their relatives: B & E (for "Blas and Elías"), Mike's (for Elías' son) and Amada Acres (for Elías' wife). West Alto Bonito and Mike's were developed primarily by Elias López who al- most always sold lots through Contract for Deed and, while both Blas and Elías devel- oped B and E jointly, Blas undertook the actual business side of the development.11 Blas Chapa was much more involved in the remaining colonias, but he was less likely to offer purchasers a Contract for Deed, but sold lots much more informally, keeping an accounts' book and giving out receipts. He was also known to be more amenable to making more casual deals, taking into ac- count other criteria-such as the buyer being a personal friend or coming recommended by friends and relatives whom he knew and liked. Perhaps he was just softer: certainly, people seem to have fonder memories or enjoyed better relations with Blas Chapa than they did with Elías López-a point that came through strongly in focus group discussions that also formed an important part of the study methodology (see Ward et al., 2003, ch. 3).
nv42 | Several interesting and important findings emerge from Figures 4 and 5. First, the his- tograms show quite clearly that lots sold by Blas Chapa were much cheaper than those sold by Elías López; indeed, they were under
