You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

gy8c | All the learning we have discussed involves memory. But people are most likely to remember what they have used and maybe invented, not what they have had drilled into their heads. Marshall and Albert began learning French in the sixth grade, but six weeks into the fall semester, Albert's parents moved to Paris, taking the young boy and his sister with them. By the time he graduated from high school, Marshall had taken six years of French, memorizing vocabulary and usually acing the exams. His parents drilled him, using all the sophisticated procedures of spaced repetition. It doesn't take much imagination or insight, however, to guess which one of the two boys read, spoke, and wrote French with almost perfect fluency when they met for a reunion right before going off to college, and which one struggled to keep up with the chatter.5 People learn deeply by doing in authentic situations.6
y4mj | Students are more likely to remember what they understand. When we comprehend we make rich associations between ideas and informa- tion, and the network of connections we lay down in our brains
vpgq | enhances our memories. If through speculation, someone has invented a solution, that person can more easily recall its steps and why you should take those steps than if the person had picked up the solution from watching someone else perform the process.
ousl | To engage in the difficult business of learning deeply people often need help. This is a tricky matter because it doesn't mean simply pro- viding them with "correct answers." That's largely what traditional lec- tures do. Rather students require assistance in constructing insights and inventing ways to solve problems. Maybe the help comes as a ques- tion that sparks thought and understanding, rather than as an explana- tion. Students need an opportunity to try, fail, and receive feedback. Novice learners who have recently struggled with the same problems can often provide the best assistance to the absolute beginner. Those novice learners remember the tough parts while experts have forgotten the potholes along the route. The scholar often uses shortcuts in think- ing while the neophyte may need to think through every step. But stu- dents also need far more than intellectual assistance. Emotional help is often crucial, not simply because humans harbor anxiety and misgiv- ings, but also because struggling with deeply held paradigms can prove traumatic.
m4ju | If learners must meet new standards, they may require assistance in understanding them and practice in applying the criteria to their own work. To remain motivated, people need to believe that their work will matter and that it will have lasting consequences for themselves and perhaps for others, and that the standards will be applied honestly and fairly. That process begins with clearly defined standards and lots of practice in comprehending the criteria.
a0mb | Going Bad
ki8m | What can go wrong beyond those pitfalls we've already mentioned? Let's explore threats that emerge from a couple of strong social forces. You may have noticed that we've made no mention of "intelligence" as a factor in learning, even though many traditional educators have relied almost exclusively on that concept to explain who succeeds and who
km8w | comes up short. "It doesn't matter what I do in class," a math professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York Univer- sity once told us. "The gifted students will get it, and the weak ones won't." This genius theory of education pervades schools on all levels, but it doesn't set well with everyone, or with some important research on human development.
wzno | When Carol Dweck finished her doctorate in psychology at Yale in 1972, she had one burning question on her mind. Why do some people melt in the face of failure while others zip right through adversity, even using it to improve their work? "I grew up in an . .. era that worshipped IQ" she told her campus newspaper recently, "and thought that" it largely determined your future. "My sixth grade teacher even seated us around the room in IQ order."7 After more than forty years of research, the Lewis and Virginia Eaton Professor of Psychology at Stanford Univer- sity has found that people's conception of intelligence has more influence than does anything you might measure as an IQ. "If you believe your intelligence is just a fixed trait," Dweck explained, you're likely to de- velop a sense of helplessness. If you think you don't know and can't learn, you're not apt to try something. But that feeling of helplessness can also emerge among people who think they are smart and also be- lieve human brains can't grow.
xagm | Imagine a kid who has heard all his life, "You're really brilliant." He may then build his whole self-image around being a genius. Soon he may grow afraid to try anything new for fear he will fail and prove he's not so sharp after all. In contrast, "if you think .. . your talents, abilities and intelligence . .. can grow" then "you want to jump in and develop them," Dweck summarized. That can make a huge difference in some- one's learning.
iwn5 | Thus, people who believe their intelligence is fixed for life often have difficulty embracing failure. They tend to recoil from their mistakes rather than learning from them. If a teacher tries to put them in a situa- tion where their mental models do not work (creating a "model fail- ure"), they resist and learn little because they cannot stand to fail. Mean- while, students flourish with challenges to their thinking if they believe intelligence can grow.
uooz | Fortunately, Dweck and her colleagues have found that fixed and growth mindsets, as she calls them, come from conditioning, not from any innate qualities of someone's brain or personality. They can change. In a series of powerful experiments, she and her colleagues discovered certain experiences that cause children to develop one mindset or an- other. People who hear a steady stream of person praise ("how smart you are"), for example, often grow a fixed view of intelligence and a feeling of helplessness, while those who encounter task-oriented feedback ("you must have worked hard on this") build a strong growth mindset. In her research, Dweck found that students with the fixed view gave up easily, sometimes complaining that they were "not a math person" (or 'writing person"), and growing easily bored with school, especially if they failed. Furthermore, and this is probably the most disturbing re- sult, their abilities actually decline in the face of failure. Meanwhile, students with growth perspectives sail right through adversity and often deliberately seek hard challenges.8
pxbq | None of this means we've discovered a magic cure. We continue to face enormous problems in changing anyone's mindset, especially as people grow older. Yet some of the Super Courses we will explore have devised some innovative approaches with promising results. They de- serve additional trials and careful research to find out what works and what doesn't.
jfsr | Stereotype Threat
u15r | Joshua Aronson and Claude Steele found different social forces shaping learning outcomes.9 If you are a member of a group about which there is a popular negative stereotype, that common belief can influence your performance in school and elsewhere even if you personally reject it. Obviously, if you accept the negative idea that "people like you" can't do something, you will give up easily. Failure will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. But you don't have to accept the negative stereotype for it to affect you. On a subconscious level it may simply bother you that others think of you in terms of that popular image, even if you never internalize a sense of inferiority. In a silent and unspoken dash to exonerate yourself
lq35 | and others, tensions grow. Nervousness increases, and your academic performance tanks.
3g9w | Margaret Shih knew that research but asked a brand new question. We have lots of stereotypes in our culture, she noticed. Some positive. Others more negative. Many people believe, she pointed out, that women can't do higher mathematics as well as men can. At the same time, many Americans also think that people of Asian descent possess some kind of "math superiority" gene. But what about Asian American women? Which stereotype, negative or positive, will influence their performance?10
d09o | To find out, she created three comparable groups of Harvard under- graduates. They were all females and Asian Americans, were majors in mathematically oriented fields, and wanted to attend graduate school in their discipline. In other words, she had fairly reliable evidence that if she gave the advanced portion of the Graduate Record Examination in math to everyone in her sample, the group performances would be sta- tistically indistinguishable. But that's not what happened. Shih's inter- vention changed the outcome. It was her experiment.
ylhz | She asked each woman in her three groups to fill out a questionnaire before taking the test. It looked fairly innocent: name, telephone num- ber, and so forth, about a dozen items of seemingly innocuous ques- tions. But the first group had an inquiry designed to trigger a subcon- scious reminder of their gender. The second group didn't have that question but had another one meant to prompt a reminder of ethnicity. Psychologists call this process making something salient. The third group had neither of the subconscious triggers. You now have the data you need to predict how the three groups did. The group that had the reminder about ethnicity performed better than the other two; the one with the prompt about gender came in last. Little things a teacher does can have a huge influence on students' learning, lives, and academic performance. So much for the genius theory so popular at places like the Courant Institute!11
