        "content": "mdnj | The regulator term becomes more complicated for this action and we do not reproduce it here, see for details of this. Following their approach one arrives at the LPA plus wave function renormalization flow equations:\nmwy0 | Partial derivative with respect to K of V subscript K of chi equals Upsilon divided by four times one over K plus second partial derivative with respect to chi of V subscript K of chi equation ninety-five.\nhg8q | Partial derivative with respect to K of zeta subscript comma chi equals Upsilon divided by four times P divided by zeta subscript comma chi times D squared equation ninety-six.\nrcyg | D is equivalent to V subscript comma chi chi plus K zeta subscript comma chi squared. P is equivalent to four zeta subscript comma chi chi V subscript comma chi chi chi divided by D minus zeta subscript comma chi chi zeta subscript chi subscript comma chi minus three zeta subscript comma chi squared V subscript comma chi chi chi squared divided by four D squared equation ninety-seven equation ninety-eight.\nbj8l | which now consist of the previous LPA equation for the effective potential eighty-eight as expected, augmented by one more flow equation for the wavefunction renormalisation\ncygk | zeta subscript comma chi. As before we will integrate the LPA equation eighty-eight by discretising along the chi direction and solving the resulting set of coupled ODEs in K. Once the effective potential V subscript K of chi has been obtained the second PDE can be solved zeta subscript comma chi in a similar way. It is worth pointing out here approach differs slightly from in that the effective potential obeys the same equation as in the LPA approximation even with the inclusion of wave function renormalization. This is because the equilibrium state is described exactly by the LPA equation as we mentioned above and explicitly recall in Appendix A. The LPA flow equation was first solved in, while more recently wave function renormalization was included for a double well potential in.\nrtk7 | Four. The Effective Equations of Motion.\n1wc3 | A standard formulation of classical mechanics involves the principle of least action. If one considers the classical action\n333g | Script S: Script S equals the integral dt L of x, dot x, minus jx equation ninety-nine.\n6kja | where L of x, dot x is the Lagrangian and a source term has been added, one can obtain the equations of motion by requiring the variational derivative of Script S to be zero:\nfmi5 | the fraction delta Script S over delta x equals j equation one hundred.\nbqn5 | The Effective Action EA Gamma is so named because its definition makes it look like a classical action but includes the effect of fluctuations that have been integrated out. Defining\n4lyq | e to the power of Script W of J equals the integral D Phi e to the power of negative Script S of Phi plus the integral dt J Phi equation one hundred one.\njzqz | the effective action Gamma of X is then defined as\n0uje | Gamma of X equals the integral t J X minus Script W of J equation one hundred two.\napx3 | where\nkcrm | X equals the expected value of Phi. equation one hundred three.\nmbsp | We then have\nzynb | the fraction delta Gamma over delta X equals J equation one hundred four.\n8h0u | Therefore Gamma, the central object of the functional renormalization group, leads to effective equations of motion that incorporate the aggregate effects of the thermal fluctuations.\nb09f | A. The Effective Equation of Motion for the one point function.\nzutp | In a similar way to how the classical action Script S of x can yield the classical equations of motion through variational derivatives, so too does Gamma of chi yield the effective equation of motion for the one point function (or average position)\nqgmy | chi: the fraction delta Gamma over delta chi of t equals zero equation one hundred five.\n40wi | Here we have assumed there are no external sources (J equals zero). Under the I P A equation one hundred five is:\na418 | the fraction delta Gamma subscript K equals zero over delta chi of t equals second partial derivative of chi minus partial derivative with respect to chi of V subscript K equals zero of chi partial derivative with respect to chi squared of V subscript K equals zero of chi equals zero equation one hundred six.\ne9lu | where the final equality comes by assuming that source terms have been set to zero (i.e J of t equals zero).
