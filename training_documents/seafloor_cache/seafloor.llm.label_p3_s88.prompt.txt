You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

h2l3 | high-resolution (50 m or better) regional bathymetric data are lacking, and most of the region is unexplored, particularly in the north. The first indication of hydrothermal venting in the Jean Charcot troughs was a methane anomaly detected in the water column near the Starfish seamount during the KAIYO 89 cruise (Urabe et al., 1990). This anomaly was investigated on the SOLAVENTS cruise, which recovered fresh and

Additional cruises in the area included the SEAPSO Leg 2 cruise (Récy et al., 1986), a GLORIA side-scan sonar survey (Johnson et al., 1992), and the SOPACMAPS cruise (Kroenke, 1995). More recent work has been aimed at exploration for SMS deposits. The Tinakula deposit was discovered by Neptune Minerals, Inc., in Sep- tember 2011 during the ASHR Leg 2 cruise aboard the MV Dorado Discovery. It is located in the Temotu Province within the exclusive economic zone of the Solomon Islands, approxi- mately 890 km east-southeast of Guadalcanal. The discovery was initially made by locating the source of a seafloor-hugging hydrothermal plume, followed by dives with a remotely oper- ated vehicle (ROV), which located sulfide chimneys. Addi- tional mapping, ROV grab sampling, and shallow drilling occurred during four subsequent (2011-2012) cruises.

bd9h | The Tinakula SMS deposit is located at depths of 1,070 to 1,204 m b.s.l. on the flank of the Starfish stratovolcano (Fig. 1B). The geology of the Tinakula area has been interpreted from seafloor observations and sampling during ROV dives,

vpgq | Volcanoes in the Tinakula area are composed of basaltic andesite (53.4-57.3 wt % SiO2) and dacite (63.0-67.9 wt % SiO2) (Anderson, 2018) and include composite cones, cinder cones, and the submarine equivalent of maars (craters without cones) (see App. Fig. Al). The morphologies of these edifices are broadly similar to those of subaerial volcanoes, but the edifices are consistently smaller than their subaerial equiva- lents. In the central part of the map area, the volcanic cones are aligned along a large (~1.6 km long) NS-trending fissure (Fig. 2, inset). The southern part of the fissure is dominated by a large composite cone with bimodal lava flows and blocky volcanic talus. This is followed northward by a 900-m-long row of cinder cones, on which the deposit is centered, and two small maar-like craters at the northern end of the fissure. The volcanic material making up the cinder cones consists of vari- ably altered basaltic andesite with vertical and lateral facies variations over several meters, including changes in clast size, shape, composition, and degree of sorting (Figs. 3, 4; App. Figs. A2-A18). The breccia facies include the following: (1)

ki8m | monomict breccia characterized by clasts with glassy curvi- planar margins, flow-banded phenocrysts, and local jigsaw-fit textures (Figs. 3A, B, 4B); (2) monomict breccia composed of vesicular volcanic clasts associated with variable amounts of juvenile clasts, glass shards, and crystal fragments and rare blocks or bombs (Figs. 3C-E, 4C); and (3) polymict breccia associated with mass-flow bedforms with rounded to suban- gular clasts, ranging from relatively unaltered to completely clay altered clasts (Fig. 3F). The predominant facies is mas- sive to crudely bedded monomict breccia (lapillistone) with clasts containing up to 20% vesicles (uniformly distributed) and no evidence of welding. Basaltic-andesitic lava flows were the last products to be erupted along the row of cinder cones at Tinakula. These facies are consistent with cinder cones on land, which form via Strombolian-type eruptions, progressing from cone-building activity to lava flows during the waning stages as the magma loses most of its gas (Vergnoille and Man- gan, 2000). Cinder cones of the type at Tinakula are generally considered to be monogenic, having formed during one erup- tive cycle over a period of days to months (e.g., Wood, 1980).
km8w | Dark-colored mafic(?) volcaniclastic sediment covers most of the map area around the Tinakula deposit, interpreted to be fallout from nearby eruptions. The material ranges from coarse sand- to pebble-sized, with a few larger volcanic frag- ments or bombs (with elongate vesicles and quenched mar- gins) and no fine ash-sized fraction. The sediment ranges in thickness from 1.5 to >8 m and is massive to crudely bed- ded with weak grading. Abundant ripple marks are observed in the sediment, with large-scale dunes (up to 7 m wide and 124 m long) visible in the bathymetric data.
wzno | Two large (55-87 m tall and 327-512 m wide) composite cones with dacite lava flows in the northwest corner of the mapped area (Fig. 2) appear to be unrelated to the central fissure. Large dacitic lava flows in the southwest corner of the map have a distinctly different morphology, with sinuous ridges that are characteristic of channelized flow. The relative ages of the flows are interpreted from ROV dive observations of sediment thickness, with higher degrees of sediment asso- ciated with older relative ages. The ages of these flows relative to other eruptions in the area are unknown.
xagm | Deposit Geology
iwn5 | The Tinakula SMS deposit consists of a series of over 900 chimneys and mound complexes distributed over a strike length of ~1,050 m along the row of cinder cones and com- posite cones (Fig. 2). The chimneys and mounds are located mainly at the tops and along the flanks of the cinder cones, as well as inside the summit craters (Fig. 5). They also occur in the center of each of the maar-like craters in the north. West of the row of cinder cones, over a strike length of ~400 m, the chimneys and mounds are not spatially associated with observable volcanic features at the seafloor but instead appear to occur along two partially buried northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast structures (between sites F and D and between sites F and E; Fig. 2).
uooz | The chimneys at Tinakula are <1 to 15 m high (typically 2-8 m) and include typical multispired sulfide structures with central vent orifices (Fig. 6A, B) and, more commonly, chim- neys with irregular morphologies (bulbous, drooping, with smooth or popcorn-textured outer surfaces; Fig. 6C, D). The
pxbq | 863
jfsr | bulbous chimneys lack central orifices and have a morphol- ogy similar to those of beehives or flange-type chimneys (e.g., Koski et al., 1994; Zhu et al., 2007). The chimneys are com- monly surrounded by sulfide talus and grow on top of low- relief hydrothermal mounds that typically rise ~2 to 3 m from the seafloor. The extent of these mounds is largely unknown due to burial by volcaniclastic sediments, but they appear to make up the bulk of the mineralization at the seafloor, accounting for about two-thirds of the total amount of iden- tified massive sulfide. Individual chimney mound complexes can be traced for up to 70 m on the seafloor. Where exposed, the mound material is distinctly laminated with layers of bar- ite and sulfide minerals up to 0.5 m thick, and they have unex- pectedly smooth surfaces (Fig. 6C). The layered barite-sulfide mounds are most similar to features described by Hein et al. (2014) from the East Diamante caldera in the Mariana arc. The sulfide deposits are mostly inactive, and the surrounding volcaniclastic sediment is widely indurated and locally miner- alized (Fig. 6D). Active venting is limited to a few sites with shimmering water at the base of chimneys or along fractures in the indurated sediments, associated with bacterial mats (Fig. 6A). Venting of white to gray smoke from chimney spires is rare (Fig. 6B). Fe-Mn oxides are widespread along fractures in the seafloor, extending up to 100 m away from the chim- ney complexes and mounds (Fig. 2). Abundant <1-m-tall Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide chimneys and silica-rich chimneys are associated with bacterial mats (Fig. 6E) and occur along the fractures (Fig. 6F).
u15r | The surface expression of hydrothermal precipitates cov- ers ~77,000 m2, including ~ 13,800 m2 of active chimneys and mounds, 51,800 m2 of inactive chimneys and mounds, and 9,300 m2 of partially buried chimneys and mounds (Fig. 2). Areas of low-temperature venting, dominated by Fe and Mn oxides, occur over an additional 130,000 m2 (91,000 m2 of Fe oxides and 38,000 m2 of Mn oxides), although these areas commonly overlap those of the chimneys and mounds. The area of subseafloor sulfide mineralization is not completely known, so the full size of the deposit could be much larger. The areal extent of this deposit is significant compared to others discovered along mid-ocean ridges and along arcs and back-arc basins; fewer than 10% have dimensions larger than 5,000 m2 (Hannington et al., 2010). Modern sulfide deposits with comparable sizes (by area) include the Solwara 1 deposit in the Eastern Manus basin (90,000 m2) and the Mir zone, Ashadze-1, and Ashadze-2 deposits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (50,000 m2 each) (Hannington et al., 2010, 2011). It should be emphasized, however, that the large areal footprint of the Tinakula deposit may not necessarily correlate with a large tonnage of massive sulfide.
