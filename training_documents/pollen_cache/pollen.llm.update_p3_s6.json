Or flowers may offer a reliable meeting site for mates or hosts or prey, or for females an oviposition site providing shelter for eggs and larvae. More rarely they are used as a warming-up site by insects in cold climates, usually because the flowers trap some incoming solar radiation, which enhances their own ovule development, but occasionally because a few flowers can achieve some metabolic thermogenesis that warms their own tissues.\nko3c | Three. How Do Flowers Encourage Animal Visitors?\nxek3 | Many plant attributes contribute to attraction of visitors: J. Thomson usefully groups these as plant presentation. Some of these attributes are readily apparent to visitors, and these may be features of individual flowers (e.g., color, shape, scent, reward availability, or time of flowering) or features of whole plants or groups of plants (e.g., flower density, flower number, flower height, or spatial pattern). The more readily apparent plant presentation traits can be divided into attractants (advertising signals), dealt with mainly in chapters five and six, which discuss visual and olfactory signals, and rewards (usually foodstuffs), dealt with in chapters seven through nine. Aspects of the timing and spacing of flowers, and how these might be affected by competition between different flowering plants, are given more in-depth treatments in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two.\nbbpr | Other floral attributes are more cryptic to the visitor and may only determine the reproductive success of the plant in the longer term; these might include pollen amounts, ovule numbers, the genetic structure of the plant population, the presence and type of incompatibility system, etc.\n5zyf | It is generally in the plant's interest to support and even improve its visitors' efficiency, encouraging them to go to more flowers of the same species (so ensuring that only conspecific pollen is taken and received) and to go to flowers with fresh pollen available and/or with receptive stigmas for pollen to be deposited upon. Many flowers therefore add signals of status to their repertoire, via color change, odor change, or even shape change. Visitors are thereby directed away from flowers that are too young or too old or already pollinated. Instead they will tend to concentrate their efforts on those (fewer) flowers per plant that are most in need of visitation, thus also being encouraged to move around between separate plants more often and to ensure outcrossing rather than selfing. Reasons for favoring breeding by outcrossing (i.e., with other plants) are covered more fully in chapter three.\n9own | Four. What Makes a Visitor into a Good Pollinator?\nbqfb | In many ways this is the crucial theme running through this book. It relates to what is probably the major\nwwdt | current debate in pollination ecology, that is, to what extent pollination it is a generalist process and to what extent it is a specialist one. Pollination has in the past nearly always been categorized in terms of syndromes, with particular groups of flowers recognized as having particular sets of characteristics (of color and scent, shape, timing, reward, etc.) that suit them to be visited by particular kinds of animals; and it is implicit in this approach that these suites have often been arrived at and selected for by convergent evolution in plant families that are unrelated. Thus most authors have used terms such as ornithophily to describe the bird pollination syndrome, or psychophily for the butterfly pollination syndrome. Flower characteristics would be listed that fit each syndrome, and an unfamiliar flower's probable pollinators could therefore be predicted. Flowers in each category were seen as having a degree of specialization that suited them to their particular visitors, with some syndromes being more specialized than others. Nearly all earlier works on pollination were organized around this theme of syndromes, and it served as a useful structure for understanding animal-flower interactions for nearly two centuries. Without knowing this background it would be nearly impossible to follow the current debates that are a major focus for pollination ecologists, and it would also be very difficult to structure the information on flower attractants and flower rewards in chapters five through nine. This book thus retains a syndrome-based approach throughout its early chapters and explicitly considers the evidence in support of a syndrome approach in chapter eleven; then it unashamedly covers each of the syndromes in turn in chapters twelve through nineteen, providing all the core materials on which later criticisms might be based.\nmn1r | The criticisms and debates focus around the reality of syndromes and how far they have been overplayed in the previous literature, perhaps blinkering or biasing our perceptions. Many authors now regard flower pollination as a much more generalized phenomenon, where most flowers get many different kinds of visitors and have not been and are not being heavily selected to specialize for the needs of one particular \"best\" visitor. This approach is specifically addressed in chapter twenty. It will be a major argument there that the issue has been clouded by an as yet insufficient distinction between flower visitors and pollinators. So what does make a visitor into a good pollinator?\n5vqw | Physical Factors\nmeyw | Any animal that is to be an effective pollinator must have the ability to passively pick up pollen as its body moves past the anthers of a flower that it visits and carry that pollen to another flower. Normally this will be aided by the animal being a good physical fit in terms of size and shape, so that in alighting on the flower surface, or when inserting its tongue or beak of appropriate length, some specific part of its body touches the anther. Additionally pollen pickup and carriage will be aided if the animal has appropriate surface structures; pollen adheres well to feathers, fur, and hairy or scaly surfaces in insects but does not get transported well on shiny or waxy surfaces (and may even be damaged by certain surface secretions). Hence a small shiny beetle taking some nectar by crawling into the lower surface of a large tubular corolla where the anthers are in the corolla roof may well be a regular visitor to that flower but is unlikely to be an effective mover of its pollen; in effect, it is acting as a \"cheat\" as far as the flower is concerned and may be termed an illegitimate visitor.\n2e62 | Behavioral Factors\n75y3 | Different animals land on and forage at flowers in very different fashions. There are many aspects of behavior that will affect whether a given animal is going to be a good pollinator. Pollinators will seldom have a complete perception of all the aspects of plant presentation mentioned above, but they will respond to at least some of them in ways that are useful to the plant:\n```",
