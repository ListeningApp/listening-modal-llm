        "content": "vbni | Embedded librarianship is one specialized method for offering outreach where librarians have an information intermediary role in a team or community. For example, public librarians can be embedded personally or virtually in local government or community organizations and can serve as a great resource in times of crisis. Academic outreach librarians, also called liaison librarians, may have office hours or get embedded in online classes (see also Chapter nine: Learning and Research Institutions: Academic Libraries), and they can serve as resources on curriculum planning committees at the departmental and university levels. Embedded librarians have also developed a variety of collaborative relationships with patrons, city administrators, and even medical teams doing hospital rounds. In fact, embedded librarians serve as information resources for everyone from local boards doing city planning to rapid response teams during medical emergencies.\ndgcw | A more traditional but still successful application of embedded librarianship is when information professionals collaborate in team-taught information literacy components of online courses and face-to-face classes. Providing just-in-time individual instruction and research assistance for students ensures that an information professional is available at the point of need in classes. Whatever their specific role is, embedded librarians are there to provide relevant information for students, teams, and the community whether it is in person or on demand asynchronously.\ngvwz | Supporting the educational mission of schools, community colleges, universities, and more is another important role of information intermediators. Reference librarians play an educational role in person and virtually by helping users learn how to locate, navigate, and evaluate information. For example, library staff support the information needs for the College Depot at the Phoenix Public Library in addition to providing homework help and tutoring services for local school students and homeschoolers alike. During the COVID-nineteen pandemic when schools and institutions of higher education had to pivot most or all their classes online, librarians were already positioned to use streaming media to deliver virtual reference transactions and library instruction at the point of need for students.\nsk5m | Information professionals are also stepping up and using their information skills to take a more active community service role. In his book Palaces for the People, Eric Klinenberg discusses how libraries can help address social inequality in civic life by helping with information needs in community hubs during times of crisis. For example, librarians can help communities address everything from hurricanes and wildfires to food insecurity and a global pandemic or by providing on-demand information via mental health kiosks (see Textbox thirteen point four).\nqws8 | Helping individuals use new technologies and develop new skills is another role for reference librarians. Brian Kenney addresses this issue in his article, \"Where Reference Fits in the Modern Library,\" when he argues that users are looking for ways to do everything from using three-D printers to doing genealogy research rather than simply locating information. Libraries offer technology help in\n877u | Information Intermediation and Reference Services\nrzhj | TEXTBOX thirteen point four\nbfax | Case Study: Reference Services for People in Crisis\nf2y8 | A woman who was pregnant, homeless, and quarantined in a hotel with COVID-nineteen had no food and no one to assist her obtain food. She contacted her local library looking for information on how she could obtain food assistance. The person at the reference desk contacted a local food bank, explained the situation, and was able to get back to the woman in crisis with contact information needed for immediate community assistance.\no7qm | person and more recently virtually to help people use various technologies such as Kindles and iPads and answer questions about social media, e-books, audiobooks, and the web. Likewise, help with information on how to do things also takes place in makerspaces and beta spaces that foster innovation and experimentation.\nd52l | A unique challenge for information professionals is that their roles have had to constantly change and adapt as today's modes of services also change and evolve. This means that twenty-first-century information professionals need the flexibility to deal with rapid political, health, climate, and work-related changes and to learn new processes and procedures in support of their service philosophy for the communities they serve. For example, while information professionals were pivoting to provide services virtually during the COVID-nineteen pandemic, they were also simultaneously challenged to reimagine how their information services would be provided in the postpandemic new normal. This means that reference librarians and information intermediators of all kinds need to be creative, innovative, and technologically skilled, and information intermediators need new skill sets to offer the high-tech reference services their users want.\nqlbb | For example, school librarians were frequently the go-to people as technology integration leaders when schoolteachers and students had to switch to online instruction during the twenty twenty to twenty twenty-one academic year. In addition, school librarians assisted with everything from helping configure and distribute Chromebooks to students and helping teachers learn to use various learning management platforms such as Canvas on one hand to expanding online learning resources for online classes on the other.\nnhsg | Academic, public, and special librarians all faced similar challenges when figuring out how to safely offer reference services while working from home, using Zoom for instruction, meetings, and reference interviews, and developing online tutorials, Bitmoji virtual libraries, and subject guides. However, no matter which delivery model is used or what type of information organization is involved, information professionals have demonstrated that they are prepared to integrate intermediation services and technology skills with other parts of their organizations to pivot and address the information needs of users in and outside of those organizations.\nhy0l | No matter which delivery model is used or what type of information organization is involved, information professionals have demonstrated that they are prepared to integrate intermediation services and technology skills with other parts of their organizations to pivot and address the information needs of users in and outside of those organizations.\n4jmz | The array of job titles other than the term \"reference librarian\" reflect the wide range of jobs that entail helping users find and access information that they need. For example, job titles can range from emerging technology librarian to community librarian to student success librarian. These emerging roles also can address interdepartmental responsibilities that range from managing learning resources centers in schools and institutions of higher educa-\nb7cq | tion to using learning management systems that provide access to digital resources and reference services.\n0b39 | Check This Out",
