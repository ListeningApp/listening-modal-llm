        "content": "3g9w | Here, we are interested in the quasi-integrable regime, delta much less than one. The first issue is the determination of the mean free path ell. In the HPG with a diatomic mass arrangement, ell corresponds to the average space traveled by a single velociton before the collisions induce a sizeable change of its original velocity. Given the mass arrangement, the collision types left parenthesis M one, M two right parenthesis and left parenthesis M two, M one right parenthesis alternate and it is thereby appropriate to look at velocity changes every second iterate left parenthesis U goes to U prime goes to U double prime right parenthesis. From equation six.\nd09o | U double prime equals left parenthesis one minus delta right parenthesis U prime plus delta chi two equals left parenthesis one minus delta squared right parenthesis U plus delta left parenthesis chi two minus chi one right parenthesis plus delta squared chi one where chi one and two denote the velocities of the quasi-particles encountered by the velociton U, hereby assumed to be uncorrelated Gaussian variables with zero average and variance the average of chi one and two squared equals V squared (neglecting the mass difference between\nylhz | the two particles). To leading order in delta, the map can be turned into the stochastic differential equation\na3td | U dot equals negative delta squared U plus the square root of two delta V zeta, where zeta is a unit-variance white noise, while time is measured in two tau units, tau being the average collision time. As a result, the distribution of U values diffuses, its variance growing initially as D sub U equals two delta squared V squared T, so that the time needed for D sub U to be approximately equal to V squared is T approximately equal to tau over delta squared (in physical time units) and the corresponding mean free path is ell approximately equal to V tau over delta squared. In other words, we expect\nex5k | theta equals two. Numerical results have been obtained by implementing the standard non-equilibrium procedure. Left and right edges are attached to Maxwellian heat baths at temperatures T sub L equals six and T sub R equals four with delta T equals T sub L minus T sub R and the flux J determined from the average energy exchanged in the steady state. For the HPG we employ the thermal-wall method.\n9d4o | In Figure one A we plot the rescaled thermal conductivity delta squared kappa of the diatomic HPG, referred to the effective length xi equals L delta squared. The various curves correspond to different delta values - delta decreases from top to bottom. There is clear evidence of a ballistic regime followed by a diffusive one, as accounted for by equation three. For the smaller values of delta, Fourier-like transport persists up to the maximal available L, while a crossover to the anomalous regime is seen upon increasing delta. Upon decreasing delta, the curves converge from above towards an asymptotic shape, kappa sub N equals J sub N left parenthesis xi right parenthesis xi over delta T. In fact, for delta approaching zero and fixed xi, L increases left parenthesis L equals xi over delta squared right parenthesis, so that the corresponding J sub A left parenthesis L right parenthesis contribution becomes increasingly negligible.\ncjq2 | Then, J sub Lambda is estimated from the data for the smallest perturbation amplitude (since J sub A is practically negligible over the explored length range). The simple formula four\n5esx | proves remarkably accurate: see the solid upper curve in figure two, to be compared with the circles, which represent the numerical HPG results.\nm5ka | As a second test, we consider the diatomic Toda model. For large energy densities, most of its dynamical properties are basically equal to the HPG and we thus expect again ell approximately equal to delta to the power of negative two, i.e. theta equals two. At lower energies, one should estimate the soliton scattering rates due to mass inhomogeneities; however, there are no reasons to expect a different scaling behavior. Indeed, the typical thermalization time is of order delta to the power of negative two in a wide energy range. The conductivities taken from the reference are reported in Figure one B after a proper rescaling. The data collapse confirms the validity of our arguments.",
