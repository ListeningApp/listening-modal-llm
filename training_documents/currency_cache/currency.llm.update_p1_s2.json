In spite of this, governmental policies have created barriers to its full success. This paper examines local currency from a community development perspective, reviews the policy environment in the United States, and identifies policy changes that can support local currencies. Four major types of local currency proxy, fiat, local exchange trading systems, and time banks are described. Federal policy barriers in the U.S. Constitution, statutes, and tax regulations as well as state prohibitions to local currency are examined.\nao6z | Introduction\nq0m5 | Throughout American history, local communities have promoted the wellbeing of their members by developing and utilizing economic, social, environmental, and human capital. Local governments and community-based organizations engage in community development to provide economic opportunities, safe environments, education, and social support. Two important community development approaches are people-centered and bottom-up. People-centered community development emphasizes local control and self-efficacy. Bottom-up community development arises from the citizens and is based on local resources and perspectives. These approaches allow communities to tailor initiatives to their visions and values.\nyhdc | In impoverished locales, one of the major challenges of community development is the lack of financial resources. To the frustration of concerned citizens, there may be resources available in the community-underemployed individuals with available time, vacant lots that could become\njte4 | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\n61c4 | community gardens, yoga classes with room for more students-yet there is not enough money to engage this capacity. Vacant lots stay vacant, classes stand empty, and human potential remains underutilized. A study of community development corporations in Detroit, Michigan found they faced difficulty funding their initiatives. Many of the CDCs reported that available grant funding did not match the true needs of their communities. Instead, the CDCs molded their missions to meet funders' visions; this \"top-down nature of the grant process\" precluded CDCs from setting their own community-based agendas, impeding people-centered and bottom-up approaches to community development.\nkesh | Since twenty eleven, federal funding for many community programs such as tutoring, job training, education, and meals for elderly citizens has been cut. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development reduced spending on Community Development Block Grants, which are designed to encourage citizen participation and improve low- to moderate-income communities, from four point four five billion dollars in twenty ten to two point seven nine eight in twenty fourteen. Even public libraries are experiencing lean times, requiring cuts to collections, staff, and hours of operation. Though much of the funding for social services still originates from the federal government, increased responsibility is being placed in the hands of local communities. However, smaller geographies are often at the mercy on the national and global economy and have limited influence on their own economic wellbeing.\nd8t0 | A people-centered, bottom-up tool that has the potential to give local communities more control over their development efforts is local currency. Described\n6kpu | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\neeeo | in detail below, local currency can take a variety of forms and operates in conjunction with the national currency. Local currencies have existed in the United States since colonial times and recent decades have seen a resurgence in their use. In nineteen ninety-one, the Ithaca HOURS printed currency was introduced in Ithaca, New York. Since then, over two hundred local currency systems have started in the United States. Though touted as way to reduce poverty and empower individuals and communities, local currencies are often inhibited from fully flourishing by governmental policies. This paper examines local currencies from a community development perspective, reviews the policy environment in the United States, and identifies policy changes that can support local currencies and their promise for community development and poverty reduction.\nqukw | Local Currency as a Community Development Tool\n0hrs | Local currencies are a form of complementary currency that operate in conjunction with national legal tender and are not intended to supplant it, but to complement it. From airline mileage points to the online currency Bitcoin, complementary currencies facilitate the exchange of goods or services. Local currencies are a specialized type designed as a public good in geographic areas to help promote community goals for cultural, human, social, and economic capital and infrastructure.\nr8pf | Like community gardens and alternative financing, local currency is a part of a re-localization movement and aspires \"to increase exchange activity at the local level and support all of the positive cultural and social outcomes of greater local employment, mutual self-help and cooperation.\" Local currencies are crafted to reflect the unique characteristics of a community because backing a currency with local goods or services promotes those products. For example, a community currency in Philadelphia bases its currency creation\nr5hm | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT\no949 | on volunteerism and a food-based currency in Montpelier, Vermont, increases supply and demand for locally produced food.\nyc87 | The literature indicates that local currency helps develop social and human capital. Local currency has been shown to build relationships and increase social support, increase community pride, help people develop new skills, and enhance personal growth, wellbeing, and mental health. Promoters of local currencies also see them as a way to improve economic conditions and resiliency, support community values, empower communities and citizens to meet specialized as well as basic needs, and assist economically marginalized citizens. Economic resiliency and monetary theory suggests community currencies have the potential to make a significant economic impact. Research has shown modest, though important, economic effects including increased local wealth, improved business infrastructure and local economy, and altered spending patterns. Nonetheless, scholars concur that in the present policy environment, local currencies face barriers to increasing their economic impact beyond a small to moderate scale.\nonea | Currency Designs",
