You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ug1e | 118 that ApoE4 reduces the threshold at which Tau aggregates by ~ 25-fold compared to ApoE3 and
txjz | 119 ~200-fold compared to ApoE2, thereby dramatically elevating risk for Tau aggregation due to
tahh | 120 neuroproteasome dysfunction. Neuroproteasome-inhibition-induced endogenous Tau inclusions
rja2 | 121 migrate as a high molecular weight species, which is typically reported only in the AD brain or
jk9f | 122 with seeding-competent Tau(43-46). Using quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis supported by
lu5d | 123 imaging in primary neurons and in vivo, we find that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the
mw2y | 124 phosphorylation of Tau at sites consistent with pathological aggregated Tau in the AD brain. We suggest that neuroproteasomes serve as a pivotal proteostasis factor, mechanistically distinct from canonical degradation systems, directly linking ApoE to the formation of endogenous Tau aggregates.

7d5n | 133
22rs | 134 We sought to purify the neuroproteasome directly out of the mouse brain. Our attempts to do this out of wild-type (WT) tissue proved challenging due to lengthy preparations which caused low
bjpt | 135
vkpg | 136 yields. To circumvent this, we built a transgenic mouse line to endogenously tag the 20S
yix9 | 137 proteasome for affinity purification. The proteasome is comprised of the 20S catalytic core
iaod | 138 particle which, as part of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation system, can be terminally
t8jd | 139 associated with either one or two 19S regulatory particles, referred to as the 26S (20S+19S) or 140 30S <LATEX>\left( 2 0 S + t w o \quad 1 9 S \right)</LATEX> proteasome respectively. The 20S core is characterized by four axially 141 stacked heptameric rings: the outer alpha subunit rings which gate substrate entry and the inner
nz5q | 142 rings which contain the catalytic beta subunits. The 19S caps contain subunits to bind
a2fr | 143 ubiquitylated substrates and ATPases to unfold said substrates into the 20S core. Therefore,
hm2f | 144 modifying the 20S with affinity tags allows us to isolate any complex containing the core
rrgl | 145 proteasome, such as free 20S, singly-capped 26S, doubly-capped 30S proteasomes, or the
yf3c | 146 neuroproteasome. We modified the C-termini of nearly every core proteasome subunit with
ptp0 | 147 either 6X-His or Strep-II tags and screened out constructs based on low expression and
qtyd | 148 interference with proteasome function (Fig S1A). Of the remaining two constructs, we found that
ju7r | 149 only the C-terminal modification of Psma3 was compatible with proper proteasome assembly
ggbe | 150 and function and did not adversely affect cell health (Fig S1B). Based on these data, we
vefl | 15: generated a 20S-FLAG transgenic line by adding flanking loxP sites surrounding the final exon
k6et | 152 (Exon 11) of the Psma3 gene followed by the same sequence with a linker containing a 3X-
mw5f | 153 FLAG tag (Fig 1A). By crossing 20S-FLAG transgenic mice with a line expressing Cre
m1ik | 154 recombinase driven by the pan-neuronal Actlb6 (BAF53b) promoter(47), we generated mice that
aj2w | 155 expressed FLAG-tagged proteasomes selectively in neurons (Fig 1B). Brains from 20S-
xhz8 | 156 FLAG/BAF53b-Cre mice and Cre-only littermate controls were processed and FLAG-tagged
aqos | 157 cytosolic proteasomes were isolated on beads with a nanobody against the FLAG epitope.
209y | 158 Simultaneously, 26S proteasomes were isolated using the GST-UBL affinity isolation
yrjp | 160 <LATEX>\mathrm { m e t h o d } \left( 4 8 \right)</LATEX> and all samples were immunoblotted using antibodies raised against multiple 19S

dz5o | 161 and 20S subunits. We find that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the proteasome and we fail to detect any FLAG in the Cre-only littermate controls (Fig 1B).
m2rl | 162
ek0a | 163 We next measured the catalytic activity of the FLAG-tagged proteasome compared to
e4tl | 164 unmodified proteasomes by monitoring the cleavage of a model substrate, Suc-LLVY-AMC(49).
voil | 165 An increase in fluorescence reflects the proteasome-dependent cleavage of this LLVY substrate
24g5 | 166 which mobilizes the free fluorescence of AMC. We find that the catalytic activity of isolated 26S
j1i2 | 167 proteasomes from mice expressing 20S-FLAG are indistinguishable from the unmodified
22xo | 168 proteasomes isolated from controls (Fig 1C). We find that FLAG affinity purified proteasomes 169 are catalytically identical to 26S affinity purified proteasomes (Fig 1C). We fail to detect FLAG
ye4p | 170 expression in the livers from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre mice, nor can we affinity isolate
xdal | 171 proteasomes using the FLAG epitope handle from the liver, indicative of the selective and
i4yy | 172 173 inducible nature of the 20S-FLAG transgene (Fig S1C, D). Overall, we find that mice expressing 20S-FLAG appear indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. These extensive
3e6g | 174 characterizations support the conclusion that epitope tagging of the 20S with FLAG is inert and
p9wt | 175 does not disrupt native proteasome function.
bg6v | 176
ek18 | 177 To test whether the 20S-FLAG was efficiently incorporated into the neuroproteasome, we
hdkt | 178 performed surface biotinylation experiments out of both primary neurons and hippocampal tissue
yyzt | 179 from 20S-FLAG transgenic mice. This is a well-established method for measuring
7lvc | 180 neuroproteasome surface localization(3, 50, 51). Hippocampi from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre mice
rt7z | 18: were incubated with a cell-impermeable sulfonylated Biotin-NHS-Ester to label surface-exposed
wpui | 182 amines and surface proteins were pulled down on streptavidin beads. We observe strong FLAG
23tt | 183 expression in the surface fraction, indicating that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the
v3cv | 184 neuroproteasome (Fig 1D). We fail to detect cytosolic proteins such as Actin in our surface
o6hl | 185 fraction, validating our surface-labeling approach, and fail to observe FLAG expression in 20S-
pv9r | 186 FLAG mice without Cre (Fig 1D). By blotting using an antibody which detects six of the seven
3ujw | 187 alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome including a7, the subunit coded for by Psma3, we can
ekyb | 188 clearly distinguish the modified a7 subunit overlaying with the FLAG signal, denoting
09tz | 189 modification of the endogenous protein (Fig 1D). Next, we used surface biotinylation to assess if
ncf7 | 190 our transgenic system was functional in primary cultures. Primary neurons from 20S-FLAG mice
qd2c | 191 were cultured and transduced with AAVs to express Cre recombinase at days in vitro (DIV) two
in7g | 192 and then processed for surface biotinylation at DIV14 (Fig S1E). We did not detect FLAG
1sn7 | 193 without AAVs to express Cre, supporting our conclusion that the 20S-FLAG transgene is 194 inducible and not leaky.

rnxf | 197 plasma membranes from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre brains and then gently extracted membrane
