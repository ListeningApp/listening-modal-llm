Testosterone action on the developing germ cells is mediated by the Sertoli cell.\nspl6 | iii) LH is the gonadotropin responsible for the regulation of testosterone biosynthesis. LH binds to receptors on the Leydig cell and results in the activation of the enzymes involved in the conversion of cholesterol to testosterone. Therefore, LH indirectly affects spermatogenesis by stimulating sufficient levels of androgens to be produced.\n7wzm | iv) Prolactin synergizes with LH to stimulate testosterone production. Leydig cells have receptors for prolactin. Prolactin causes an increase in the numbers of LH receptors on Leydig cells and may function in this way to potentiate LH action.\ne9xj | v) Retinoic acid acts directly on the germ cells to stimulate their entry into the meiotic pathway and also to affect Sertoli cell cyclicity.\n9vl6 | vi) Thyroxine regulates Sertoli cell numbers during development.\nc2fd | Fourteen) TEMPERATURE REGULATION OF THE TESTIS\njzvp | a) The testes in humans are located outside the body and are contained in a sac-like structure called the scrotum. The scrotum is a highly specialized structure which is designed to keep the intratesticular temperature at a constant thirty-four degrees Celsius, which is several degrees cooler than normal body temperature. This cooler temperature is absolutely crucial for maintaining normal spermatogenesis.\nf71y | b) In order to ensure proper intratesticular temperature, the cremasteric muscle in the scrotum raises the testes closer to the body when the ambient temperature is low and relaxes to lower the testes away from the body when the ambient temperature is hot. The\n31e1 | scrotum also has sparse hair and is rugose (\"wrinkled\"), which serves to increase surface area allowing further cooling of the testes.\n40ry | c) The pampiniform plexus (see Figure 1) is a network of interconnected veins, which drain the blood from the testes. The pampiniform plexus plays an important functional role in maintaining testicular temperature in the appropriate range for sperm production by cooling blood in the testicular artery before it enters the testes. Abnormalities of the pampiniform plexus, such as seen with a varicocele (varicose veins in the spermatic cord of the scrotum), can have adverse effects on spermatogenesis by interfering with the cooling mechanics of the plexus. It can also negatively affect spermatogenesis through a variety of other poorly understood factors.\nd1j2 | Fifteen) MALE GENITAL TRACT\nwstc | a) The Epididymis: The efferent ducts fuse to form the ductus epididymidis of the epididymis. The epididymis is characterized by a scalloped outline. This is a single highly coiled tube (four to six meters in length). This canal is surrounded by connective tissue and blood vessels. It is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium (rounded basal cells and columnar cells). The cells are supported by smooth muscle cells characterized by peristaltic contractions that move the sperm along the duct. The surface of the epithelium is covered by microvilli called stereocilia (these cells absorb fluid) and ciliated cells that contribute to the transport. The epididymal duct system is about twenty feet long while the vas deferens is about eighteen inches in length. The glandular portion of the vas deferens is called the ampulla. The ampulla contributes a small amount of fructose to the ejaculate. The secretions from these glands are the third in sequence to be expelled during ejaculation and contain the spermatozoa.\nba1e | b) Functions: The epithelium uptakes and digests the residual bodies remaining after spermatogenesis. During transit through the epididymis, the sperm acquire the ability to be motile (progressive motility required for fertilizing capacity). There are three regions: the head or caput, the body or corpus, and the tail or cauda. The height of the epithelium varies in thickness depending upon which portion of the epididymis is examined (increasing thickness from head to tail). Sperm epididymal maturation requires approximately ten days. Thus, the period of time from the initiation of spermatogenesis to the release of mature sperm into the lumen of the tubules (sixty-four days) plus the time required for sperm to migrate to the head of the epididymis (ten days) is approximately seventy-four days.\nen95 | The epididymis (Figure nineteen) is comprised of several ductuli efferentes that empty into a single, highly coiled ductus epididymidis, which ends as the straight ductus (vas) deferens. The epididymis is divided anatomically into the caput (head), the corpus (body), and the cauda (tail). Sperm transport through the epididymis takes approximately sixteen days in humans. This amount of time added to the seventy-four days defined above suggests that a total of approximately ninety days is required from the time of initiation of spermatogenesis to the time when mature sperm are ready for ejaculation. Therefore, the adverse effects of any insult to the testis (fever, etc.) that results in damage to spermatogenesis may not be seen in the ejaculate for as long as three months.\nl3do | During the time of epididymal migration, spermatozoa undergo maturation, gain the capability of motility, and gain the capacity to fertilize. The sperm are then stored in the cauda epididymis and the vas deferens. Depending on the frequency of ejaculation, there is equilibrium between the breakdown of aged spermatozoa and the fullness of the epididymis.\nu9bo | c) The epididymis serves several functions in the male:\n7avo | i) Maturational Changes of Spermatozoa: As spermatozoa emerge from the testis and appear in the caput epididymis, they possess no progressive motility and have no in vivo fertilizing capacity. Sperm acquire these two properties gradually during transit through the epididymis. Maturation may involve deposition of specific glycoproteins on the sperm surface. Additional changes include a change in net sperm surface charge; alterations in sperm-lectin binding properties; changes in immunoreactivity and iodination characteristics; acquisition of an increased capacity for glycolysis; modification of adenylate cyclase activity; alterations in cellular phospholipid and phospholipid-like fatty acid content; formation of disulfide bonds within the nucleus and tail and oxidation of sperm membrane sulfhydryl groups; and an increased ability to adhere to the zona pellucida. Full fertilization capacity and motility of spermatozoa is probably not achieved until they reach the cauda epididymis. The motility and fertilization capacity of epididymal sperm is regulated by androgens.\nuzo6 | d) Release of Spermatozoa: The release of spermatozoa during ejaculation is mediated by short, adrenergic contractions of the cauda epididymis and vas deferens. Spermatozoa are then mixed with the secretions of the accessory glands.\n89b4 | e) Elimination of Aged Spermatozoa: Although the epididymal environment is favorable for survival of sperm, they are not preserved indefinitely and gradually age and lose their viability.\n```",
