The activity of MSNs is modulated by inputs from cholinergic and GABA-ergic interneurons as well as glial cells. All of these different cell types within the NAc express insulin receptors. Hence, insulin can activate a complex signalling pathway in downstream DA target areas independent of its action in the VTA.\nuow2 | Two point three point one. Insulin increases DA release and reuptake\n```",
