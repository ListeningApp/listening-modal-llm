You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

m3cp | Common questions and misconceptions about creatine supplementation: what does the scientific evidence really show?
mq4s | Abstract
95el | Supplementing with creatine is very popular amongst athletes and exercising individuals for improving muscle mass, performance and recovery. Accumulating evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation produces a variety of beneficial effects in older and patient populations. Furthermore, evidence-based research shows that creatine supplementation is relatively well tolerated, especially at recommended dosages (i.e. 3-5 g/day or 0.1 g/kg of body mass/day). Although there are over 500 peer-refereed publications involving creatine supplementation, it is somewhat surprising that questions regarding the efficacy and safety of creatine still remain. These include, but are not limited to: 1. Does creatine lead to water retention? 2. Is creatine an anabolic steroid? 3. Does creatine cause kidney damage/renal dysfunction? 4. Does creatine cause hair loss / baldness? 5. Does creatine lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? 6. Is creatine harmful for children and adolescents? 7. Does creatine increase fat mass? 8. Is a creatine 'loading-phase' required? 9. Is creatine beneficial for older adults? 10. Is creatine only useful for resistance / power type activities? 11. Is creatine only effective for males? 12. Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to monohydrate and is creatine stable in solutions/beverages? To answer these questions, an internationally renowned team of research experts was formed to perform an evidence-based scientific evaluation of the literature regarding creatine supplementation.
a0a5 | Introduction
gocl | Creatine (methylguanidine-acetic acid) is endogenously formed from reactions involving the amino acids argin- ine, glycine and methionine in the kidneys and liver [1]. Exogenously, creatine is primarily consumed from meat and/or as a dietary supplement. According to PubMed (archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine) there are over 500 peer-refereed publications involving various aspects of creatine
ob1z | supplementation. Based on the enormous popularity of creatine supplementation, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) published an updated position stand in 2017 on the safety and efficacy of creatine sup- plementation in exercise, sport, and medicine [2]. This comprehensive paper provided an evidence-based review of the literature examining the effects of creatine supple- mentation on performance, recovery, injury prevention, exercise tolerance and rehabilitation, neuroprotection, aging, clinical and disease state populations, and preg- nancy. Importantly, the safety profile of creatine was also reviewed. As of September 1, 2020, the paper has been viewed 179,000 times and cited 100 times (according to Web of Science). Furthermore, Altmetric data indicates
m4cb | that the paper has been mentioned in 19 news outlets, 4 blogs, 492 tweets, 54 Facebook pages, and been uploaded 69 times in video posts. Instagram stories and posts are not included as Altmetric data.
m61y | Despite the widespread outreach of the 2017 ISSN position stand paper [2], along with other evidence- based review/meta-analysis papers involving various as- pects of creatine supplementation published after the 2015 Creatine in Health, Sport and Medicine Conference in Germany [3-34], questions and misconceptions involving creatine supplementation still remain. These include, but are not limited to: 1. Does creatine supple- mentation lead to water retention? 2. Is creatine is an anabolic steroid? 3. Does creatine supplementation cause kidney damage / renal dysfunction? 4. Does creatine supplementation cause hair loss / baldness? 5. Does cre- atine supplementation lead to dehydration and muscle cramping? 6. Is creatine supplementation harmful for children and adolescents? 7. Does creatine supplementa- tion increase body fat? 8. Is a creatine supplementation 'loading-phase' required? 9. Is creatine supplementation beneficial for older adults? 10. Is creatine supplementa- tion only useful for resistance/power type activities? 11. Is creatine supplementation only effective for males? 12. Are other forms of creatine similar or superior to mono- hydrate? Is creatine stable in solutions/beverages? To ad- dress these questions, an internationally renowned team of research experts, who have collectively published over 200 peer-refereed articles involving creatine supplemen- tation, was formed to perform an evidence-based scien- tific evaluation of the literature. Each question was answered by one researcher, chosen according to her/his expertise on the topic. Then, the final version of this manuscript was reviewed and approved by all authors, therefore reflecting the group opinion.
u2ob | Does creatine lead to water retention?
2gnm | The purported myth of creatine supplementation in- creasing body water (TBW) is likely due to early re- search which showed that creatine supplementation at 20 g/day for six days was associated with water retention [35]. It does appear that the most common adverse ef- fect of creatine supplementation is water retention in the early stages (first several days) [36]. For example, studies have shown that three days of creatine supple- mentation increased TBW and extracellular body water (ECW) [37] and intracellular water (ICW) [38]. Unfortu- nately, based on these short-term responses, this notion that creatine increases water retention over the long- term has been widely accepted [39].
emgw | Creatine is an osmotically active substance. Thus, an increase in the body's creatine content could theoretic- ally result in increased water retention. Creatine is taken up into muscle from circulation by a sodium-dependent
xaqt | creatine transporter [1]. Since the transport involves so- dium, water will also be taken up into muscle to help maintain intracellular osmolality. However, considering the activity of the sodium-potassium pumps, it is not likely that intracellular sodium concentration is dramat- ically affected by creatine supplementation [39].
