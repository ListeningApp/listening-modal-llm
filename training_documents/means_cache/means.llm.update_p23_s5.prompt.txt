You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

rut3 | . Observed power: This option provides an estimate of the probability that the statistical test could detect the difference between the observed group means (see Section 2.9.7). This measure is pointless because if the F-test is significant then the probability that the effect was detected will, of course, be high. Likewise, if group differences were small, the observed power would be low. Do power calculations before the experiment is conducted, not after (see Section 2.9.8).
m3cp | · Parameter estimates: This option produces a table of model parameters (b-values) and their tests of significance for the variables in the model (see Section 13.6.2).
mq4s | · Contrast coefficient matrix: This option produces matrices of
95el | the coding values used for any contrasts in the analysis, which is useful for checking which groups are being compared in which contrast.
a0a5 | · Homogeneity tests: This option produces Levene's test of the homogeneity of variance assumption (see Section 9.3). You'll have seen by now that I think this test needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.
gocl | . Spread vs. level plot: This option produces a chart that plots the mean of each group of a factor (x-axis) against the standard deviation of that group (y-axis). This plot is useful to check that there is no relationship between the mean and standard deviation. If a relationship exists then the data may need to be stabilized using a logarithmic transformation (see Chapter 6).
ob1z | · Residual plot: This option produces a matrix scatterplot of all combinations of pairs of the following variables: observed values of the outcome, predicted values from the model, standardized residuals from the model. These plots can be used to assess the assumption of homoscedasticity. In particular, the plot of the standardized residuals against the predicted values from the model can be interpreted in a similar way to the zpred vs. zresid plot that we have discussed before.
m4cb | · Heteroskedasticity tests: There are four tests for heteroscedasticity that you can select (two variants of the Breusch-Pagan test, White's test and an F-test). For the same reasons that I don't recommend Levene's test, I also don't recommend these (that is, because they are significance tests your decisions based on them will be confounded by your sample size).
m61y | · Parameter estimates with robust standard errors: This produces one of 5 methods (HC0 to HC4) to estimate standard errors (and, therefore, confidence intervals) for the model parameters that are robust to heteroscedasticity. These methods are described clearly in Hayes and Cai (2007). In short, HC3 has been shown to outperform HC0 to HC2 (Long & Ervin, 2000) but HC4 outperforms HC3 in some circumstances (Cribari- Neto, 2004). Basically choose HC3 or HC4.

wkbn | 13.6 Interpreting ANCOVA 13.6.1 What happens when the covariate is excluded?
ftfg | Output 13.5 shows (for illustrative purposes) the ANOVA table for these data when the covariate is not included. It is clear from the significance value, which is greater than 0.05, that puppy therapy seems to have no significant effect on happiness. Note that the total amount of variation in happiness (SST) was 110.97 (Corrected Total), of which the therapy condition accounted for 16.84 units <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { M } } \right) ,</LATEX> while 94.12 were unexplained

w8r5 | 13.6.2 The main analysis
ybik | The format of the ANOVA table in Output 13.6 is largely the same as without the covariate, except that there is an additional row of information about the covariate (Puppy_love). Looking first at the significance values, the covariate significantly predicts the dependent variable <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 3 5 , \right.</LATEX> which is less than 0.05). Therefore, the person's happiness is significantly influenced by their love of puppies. What's more interesting is that when the effect of love of puppies is removed, the effect of puppy therapy is significant <LATEX>\left( p = 0 . 0 2 7 , \right.</LATEX> which is less than 0.05). The amount of variation accounted for by puppy therapy has increased to 25.19 units and the unexplained variance <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { R } } \right)</LATEX> has been reduced to 79.05 units. Notice that <LATEX>\mathrm { S S } _ { \mathrm { T } }</LATEX> has not changed; all that has changed is how that total variation is partitioned.5
gii5 | This example illustrates how covariates can help us to exert stricter experimental control by taking account of confounding variables to give us a 'purer' measure of effect of the experimental manipulation. Looking back at the group means from Table 13.1, you might think that the significant F-statistic reflects a difference between the control group and the two experimental groups - because the 15-and 30-minute groups have very similar means (4.88 and 4.85) whereas the control group mean is much lower at 3.22. However, we can't use these group means to interpret the effect because they have not been adjusted for the effect of the covariate. These original means tell us nothing about the group differences reflected by the significant F. Output 13.7 gives the adjusted values of the group means (which we calculated in Section 13.3), and we use these values for interpretation (this is why we selected Display Means for in Section 13.5.6). From these adjusted means you can see that happiness increased across
