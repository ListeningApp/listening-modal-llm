In the treatment group, time taken on the post-treatment task drops by ten minutes (thirty-seven percent) relative to the control group, who take an average of twenty-seven minutes. Average evaluator grades in the treatment group increase by zero point four five standard deviations, with roughly similar increases for overall grades and specific grades for writing quality, content quality, and originality.\nma93 | Figure one Panels (c) and (d) show that these effects are not limited to specific pockets of the time or grade distributions: the entire time distribution shifts to the left (faster work) and the entire grade distribution shifts to the right (higher quality). At the individual worker level, Figure two shows that treated workers who received a low grade on the first task experience both increases in grades and decreases in time spent, while workers who received a high grade maintain their grade level while substantially reducing their time spent.\nc6hh | These results are virtually identical across our two main incentive schemes, covering eighty percent of respondents: a \"linear\" scheme in which respondents are paid one dollar for each point they receive\ny7ea | on each submission (each of which is graded on a one-seven point scale), and a \"convex\" scheme in which respondents are additionally paid three dollars for earning a grade of six or seven, giving them an extra incentive to produce high-quality output.\nnav4 | Two supplementary interventions allow us to probe further. In one arm involving twenty percent of participants, we require participants in both the treatment and control group to spend exactly fifteen minutes on each task. This holds effort fixed across the treatment and control groups, allowing us to interpret any difference in grades as a pure effect of ChatGPT access on productive capacity. In this arm, the treatment increases grades by a similar zero point three nine standard deviations, albeit imprecisely estimated and with a slight imbalance in pre-treatment\ngem8 | outcomes.\ne8nr | In another arm involving thirty percent of the treatment group, after completing the second task, respondents are shown their first-task output and given the opportunity to edit or replace it using ChatGPT if they wish. Twenty-three percent choose to replace their response with ChatGPT's output and twenty-five percent use ChatGPT to edit their original response, suggesting that participants view ChatGPT as a way to improve output quality in addition to a convenient way to save time.\nk78w | Two point three Productivity Inequality\ng9du | The control group exhibits persistent productivity inequality: participants who score well on the first task also tend to score well on the second task. As Figure two Panel (a) shows, there is a correlation of zero point four nine between a control participant's average grade on the first task and their average grade on the second task.\nf682 | In the treatment group, initial inequalities are half-erased by the treatment: the correlation between first-task and second-task grades is only zero point two five. This reduction in inequality is driven by the fact that participants who scored lower on the first round benefit more from ChatGPT access, as the figure shows: the gap between the treatment and control lines is much larger at the left-hand end of the x-axis.\nli1k | Two point four Human-Machine Complementarity\npbea | ChatGPT could increase workers' productivity in two ways. On the one hand, it could substitute for worker effort by quickly producing output of satisfactory quality that workers directly submit, letting them reduce the time they spend on the task. On the other hand, it could complement workers' skills: humans and ChatGPT working together could produce more than the sum of their parts, for example if ChatGPT aids with the brainstorming process, or quickly produces a rough draft and humans then edit and improve on the draft. In our experiment, evidence for the complementarity story could come in two forms: (a) we could observe treatment-group participants choosing to expend significant time editing ChatGPT's output or repeatedly prompting ChatGPT in anticipation of earning higher grades, and (b) we could observe that treatment participants' essays receive higher grades than ChatGPT's raw output, suggesting that human input adds value.\nccpt | We observe neither of these pieces of evidence, suggesting that ChatGPT is increasing productivity primarily by substituting for worker effort. Sixty-eight percent of treated participants report submitting ChatGPT's initial output without editing it, and on average treated participants are active on the task for only three minutes after we first observe them pasting in a large quantity of text (presumably from ChatGPT). There is also no correlation between how long a participant is active after pasting in the ChatGPT text and the grade they ultimately receive, and treated\n0fpw | respondents do not receive higher average grades than raw ChatGPT output that we give to evaluators to grade, meaning we find no evidence that human editing is improving the ChatGPT output. This is true even when participants are given strong pecuniary incentives to do so, in the convex incentives group.\ndqn8 | Two point five Task Structure\ncop0 | As suggested by the preceding discussion, ChatGPT substantially changes the structure of writing tasks. Figure three Panel A shows that prior to the treatment, participants spend about twenty-five percent of their time brainstorming, fifty percent writing a rough draft, and twenty-five percent editing. Post-treatment, the share of time spent writing a rough draft falls by more than half and the share of time spent editing more than doubles.\nlhkq | Two point six Skill Demand\n82ju | If ChatGPT is especially helpful to those with poor writing and communication skills relative to their other skills, it could have major labor market implications by expanding the available occupational choices and raise the earnings of individuals with strong idea-generation skills who struggle to effectively get those ideas onto paper.\ny2qo | We perform several tests of this hypothesis. We construct two measures of a person's relative writing skills. First, at the beginning of the experiment, we ask participants to rank from one to three their skills at communication (writing and speaking), problem solving, and creativity. Second, in addition to assigning overall grades, evaluators separately assess each piece of output based on writing quality, content quality, and originality; the gap between a person's first-task overall score and their writing score affords another measure.\n```",
