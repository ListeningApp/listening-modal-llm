You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

f50c | This result becomes prettier using the thermal wavelength A = h(8/2mm)1/2
8x23 | Then we get simply
nf5i | V A3
6f7n | Z =
r0bb | Now that we've worked out the statistical mechanics of a classical particle in a one- dimensional box, it's easy to copy everything for a three-dimensional box of any shape. We start with the partition function. The energy of a free particle of mass m is p. p/2m, so the partition function is the integral of exp(-p . p/2m) over all possible positions and momenta. Integrate over momentum and you get
ucxa | - e-B(p?+p3+p3)/2m dp1dp2dp3 h3 (10 -30/2m Ap) = = h 2mm β 3
dpzv | In terms of the thermal wavelength this is just 1/A3. Integrate over position and you multiply this by the volume of the box, say V. So we get an incredibly simple final answer:
p3zg | Z = X- V
dcq6 | And this sort of calculation works in any dimension: there's nothing special about the number 3 here.
4onb | PARTICLE IN A 3D BOX: ENTROPY
j6i2 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a 3d box of volume V has expected energy
su8b | (E) = kT 2 3
ap79 | and free energy
o2lj | A3 V
9ksk | F = - kT In
3rje | where A = h/V2xmkT is the thermal wavelength. But entropy S is ((E) - F)/T, so
1ib3 | S = k ln (MAS +3)
lokq | The entropy of a particle in thermal equilibrium in a three-dimensional box works very much like our earlier calculation for a one-dimensional box, with a couple of ad- justments due to the dimension. Since the particle's energy is now a quadratic function of 3 variables, the equipartition theorem now says its expected energy is
i9g3 | 〈 E>= kT.
aprs | We can work out its free energy from its partition function, which we computed in the last tweet:
nna4 | V
83b6 | F =- kT ln Z =- kln
ph9z | 13.
muji | Thus its entropy is
glmb | S = (E) - F T
saqe | The meaning of the two terms here is very similar to that for the particle in the one-dimensional box. The first term is k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states, as always for the Gibbs entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium. Here the number of accessible states is V/A3. The second term is 2k thanks to the equipartition theorem, since the particle's expected energy depends quadratically on 3 degrees of freedom. When V >> A3 this second term is a small correction to the first. As this ceases to be true, the second term becomes more important-and when A3 is comparable to V, quantum corrections to our calculation also become significant.
e6o9 | A TALE OF TWO GASES
wgep | The entropy of an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a box of volume V is
71hf | Sa = kN (In V + -InkT + - Inkl+ In Im + 2mm 3
efpl | 2
01ri | while for indistinguishable particles it's
1lfn | Si ~ KN In + InkT + In m +
3lvh | 2
6ub3 | 2
n712 | where the corrections are small compared to N as N > 0.
lxns | Now we are finally ready to tackle the entropy of a gas. We start with a 'monatomic ideal gas', which means N free point particles bouncing around in a box. But there's a subtlety! We'll get different answers depending on whether we think of these particles as distinguishable or indistinguishable. That is: do we count the state of the gas as different if we switch two particles, or not?
4afc | The formulas look very similar. There are three differences:
px1t | · For distinguishable particles we'll get an exact formula, while for indistinguishable particles we'll get an approximate one, where the corrections are small compared to N when N become large.
ehz9 | · The entropy for distinguishable particles has a term equal to 2kN, while for indistinguishable particles it has a term equal to 2kN.
qrj5 | · Most importantly, there's a huge difference in the volume dependence! Where the distinguishable particles have a term in the entropy equal to kN ln V , the indis- tinguishable ones have a term equal to kN In ~, so their entropy is considerably smaller for large volumes.
mwd5 | The last difference makes the entropy behave strangely for distinguishable particles, so in practice the physically important case is the gas of indistinguishable particles. But we'll do the calculations in both cases, because the distinguishable case is easier, and interesting.
gng6 | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: PARTITION FUNCTION
fjnz | The partition function of an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a 3d box B of volume V is
15hc | Za = JBN J 1. IRON e -B i=1 N 2m d3 p1 . . . d3PN d3 q1 . . . d3 qN
mkzd | pi · Pi h3N
uhjq | 27Tm β 3N/2
6sbj | = VN h3N
d8m4 | Thus Za = 3N A3N VN
x6o5 | where A = h(8/2Tm)1/2 is the thermal wavelength.
iw9a | Suppose we have a system of N distinguishable classical free particles in a three- dimensional box B of volume V. The state of this system is described by N positions q1, ... , qN E B and N momenta Pi, ... , PN E R3. If each particle has mass m, the energy of the ith particle is equal to
dni7 | Ei = pi · Pi 2m
uhfc | and the energy of the system is
x4b2 | E = SEi. i=1 N Let's call the partition function of this system Za. To compute this we integrate exp(-BE) over the space of states, obtaining
pbg2 | Za = LAN JARON BN JR3N exp(-ßE) d3 p1 . . . d3pNd3q1 . . . d3qN h3N .
0oy0 | Above, I proceeded to compute Za directly by doing the Gaussian integral over momenta and integrating each position over the box. Here's a slightly different way. Because
lr84 | exp(-(E) =exp(-ßE1) ... exp(-BEN),
0vq1 | the partition function Za is a product of integrals which are all equal:
gkya | BJR3 e-Bp·p/2m d3pd3q h3 .
c2iz | Za =
ya41 | The integral in the parentheses is the partition function of an single particle in a box. We have already seen that this equals
aa56 | JB JR3 e - Bp.p/2m ď3pd3q _V h3
qfgp | A3
yu1c | where A is the thermal wavelength. Thus we have
1j33 | Za =
k3a8 | We can also do this calculation with a lot less work using Puzzle 36. This implies that when we build a new system from N identical noninteracting copies of some old system, the partition function of the new system is the Nth power of the partition function of the old system. What I just did is show this in a special case.
