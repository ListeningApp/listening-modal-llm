        "content": "a63r | Output thirteen point ten shows the result of the contrast analysis specified in Figure thirteen point six and compares level two (fifteen minutes) against level one (control) as a first comparison, and level three (thirty minutes) against level one (control) as a second comparison. The group differences are displayed: a difference value, standard error, significance value and ninety-five percent confidence interval. These results show that both the fifteen-minute group (contrast one, P equals zero point zero four five) and thirty-minute group (contrast two, P equals zero point zero one zero) had significantly different happiness compared to the control group. Output thirteen point eleven shows the results of the Sidak corrected post hoc comparisons that were requested in Section thirteen point five point six. The bottom table shows the bootstrapped significance and confidence intervals for these tests and because these will be robust we'll interpret this table. There is a significant difference between the control group and both the fifteen- P equals zero point zero zero three and thirty-minute P equals zero point zero two one groups. The thirty-and fifteen-minute groups did not significantly differ P equals zero point five five eight. It is interesting that the significant difference between the fifteen-minute and control groups when bootstrapped P equals zero point zero zero three is not present for the normal post hoc tests P equals zero point one three zero. This anomaly could reflect properties of the data that have biased \ndqvj | the non-robust version of the post hoc test.\nr17u | Thirteen point six point four Interpreting the covariate\n3c47 | I've already mentioned that the parameter estimates (Output thirteen point eight) tell us how to interpret the covariate: the sign of the B-value tells us the direction of the relationship between the covariate and outcome variable. For these data the B-value was positive, indicating that as the love of puppies increases, so does the participant's happiness. Another way to discover the same thing is to draw a scatterplot of the covariate against the outcome.\ng345 | Anxious people tend to interpret ambiguous information in a negative way. For example, being highly anxious myself, if I overheard a student saying 'Andy Field's lectures are really different,' I would assume that 'different' meant rubbish, but it could also mean 'refreshing' or 'innovative'. Muris, Huijding, Mayer, and Hameetman addressed how these interpretational biases develop in children. Children imagined that they were astronauts who had discovered a new planet. They were given scenarios about their time on the planet (e.g., 'On the street, you encounter a spaceman. He has a toy handgun and he fires at you...') and the child had to decide whether a positive ('You laugh: it is a water pistol and the weather is fine anyway') or negative ('Oops, this hurts! The pistol produces a red beam which burns your skin!') outcome occurred. After each response the child was told whether their choice was correct. Half of the children were always told that the negative interpretation was correct, and the remainder were told that the positive interpretation was correct.\nsvhz | Over thirty scenarios children were trained to interpret their experiences on the planet as negative or positive. Muris et al. then measured interpretational biases in everyday life to see whether the training had created a bias to interpret things negatively. In doing so, they could ascertain whether children might learn interpretational biases through feedback.\noaen | The data from this study are in the file Muris et al two thousand and eight. The independent variable is Training (positive or negative) and the outcome is the child's interpretational bias score\n5u67 | (Interpretational_Bias) - a high score reflects a tendency to interpret situations negatively. It is important to adjust for the Age\ndvms | and Gender of the child and also their natural anxiety level (which they measured with a standard questionnaire of child anxiety called the SCARED) because these things affect interpretational biases also. Labcoat Leni wants you to fit a model to see whether Training significantly affected children's Interpretational_Bias using Age, Gender and SCARED as covariates. What can you conclude? Answers are on the companion website (or look at pages four hundred seventy-five to four hundred seventy-six in the original article).\nqrd3 | Thirteen point seven Testing the assumption of homogeneity of\nrxrg | regression slopes\ntf43 | Remember that the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes means that the relationship between the covariate and outcome variable (in this case Puppy_love and Happiness) should be similar at different levels of the predictor variable (in this case in the three Dose groups). Figure thirteen point three shows that the relationship between Puppy_love and Happiness looks comparable in the fifteen-minute and control groups, but seems different in the thirty-minute group. To test the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes we need to refit the model but customize it to include the interaction between the covariate and categorical predictor. Access the main dialog box as before and place the variables in the same boxes as before (the finished dialog box should look like\nfcco | Figure thirteen point five). To customize the model, click Model to access the dialog box in Figure thirteen point nine and select Custom. The variables specified in the main dialog box are listed on the left-hand side. We need a model that includes the interaction between the covariate and grouping variable. To test this interaction term it's important to also include the main effects otherwise variance in the outcome (happiness) may be attributed to the interaction term that would otherwise be attributed to the main effects. To begin with, then, select Dose and\n8uji | Puppy_love (you can select both simultaneously by holding down Control, or Command on a Mac), change the drop-down menu to Main effects, and click\ndf3e | to transfer the main effects of Dose and Puppy_love to the box labelled Model. Next specify the interaction term by selecting Dose and\n53eu | Puppy_love simultaneously (as just described), change the drop-down menu to\na5u1 | Interaction and click to transfer the interaction of Dose and Puppy_love to the box labelled Model. The finished dialog box should look like\nry7u | Continue\n5mda | Figure thirteen point nine. Click\ni4li | to return to the main dialog box and\nr8sm | OK\ncuin | to run the analysis.\nn1i7 | Output thirteen point eleven shows the main summary table for the model including the interaction term. The effects of the dose of puppy therapy and love of puppies are still significant, but so is the covariate by outcome interaction (Dose by\n0r5m | Puppy_love), implying that the assumption of homogeneity of regression slopes is not realistic (p equals zero point zero two eight). Although this finding is not surprising given the pattern of relationships shown in Figure thirteen point three, it raises concerns about the main analysis.\nne2o | Figure thirteen point nine Model dialog box for GLM univariate\nsqxn | When the linear model is used to compare several means adjusted for the effect of one or more other variables (called covariates) it can be referred to as analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).\n6pmo | Before the analysis check that the covariate(s) are independent\n195r | of any independent variables by seeing whether those independent variables predict the covariate (i.e., the covariate should not differ across groups).",
