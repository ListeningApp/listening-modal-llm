        "content": "pfrt | Chapter Four\niws8 | Highlight tables are often thought of as heat maps to the industry, as they use color gradient depth, saturation, or hue to highlight a quantity measure (such as highs and lows). The difference between a highlight table and a heat map is the lack of shape and size marks and the ability to see the underlying details in the highlight table. The following screenshot is an example of a highlight table. Note that the darker the color hue, the greater the percentage of spending to the total. The sum percentage of total spending is duplicated in the Marks card for both the Color shelf and the Text shelf. This allows the color hue to be affected in proportion to the numeric value and also lets the value itself be shown in the rows and columns.\nn452 | The colors used, and the other borders and elements, are completely customizable in the tables described in this section. The colors of this chart can be easily customized for each graph by double-clicking on the gradient color bar titled (in this case) sum percentage of total spending. The filters that have been created are identical to the first table named the text table in this chapter section:\nztct | Visualization - Tips and Types\nenir | Bar charts\ne4d4 | Bar charts are used to compare values and are perhaps the most useful of the chart types. Bar charts allow you to compare values across categorical dimensions (such as age groups, sex, race, cities, states, expense categories, departments, and so on; the list is endless), but they do not display the underlying data details as can be done in a table. Bar charts are used to compare values across dimensions. As we discussed in an earlier section in this chapter, length can be easily and naturally interpreted by readers. Therefore, bar charts are one of the more commonly used and appreciated charts used today.\nd8ta | The global population data used in the following section was downloaded from the World Bank by visiting the World Bank website.\nc9cw | There are several types of bar charts in Tableau - horizontal bars, stacked bars (they compare parts to a whole and are the same as pie charts), side-by-side bars (they compare two categories), Gantt charts, histograms (they measure the frequency of events and plot distribution diagrams), and bullet graphs (a relatively new compact chart invented by Stephen Few, a visualization expert; you should become familiar with his work). In this section, we will only talk about a couple of these bar charts, but I invite you to experiment on your own and learn about these other chart types if you find them appealing.\nb93o | The following screenshot shows a horizontal bar chart that depicts the top ten countries by population. The chart reveals that China and India are the two largest countries by population (with over one billion citizens each), followed by the USA, Indonesia, and other countries with a much lower population:\ntjqy | Chapter Four\n58xg | Some key design elements that should be pointed out in the previous horizontal bar chart are we used Country as the dimension and sum population as the measure. To limit the graph to the top ten countries in terms of population, we added the Country field to the Filters shelf and chose to filter the top ten countries by population in the descending order, as shown in the following screenshot:\n70zf | After filtering the data to get information about the top ten countries in the year twenty ten, we sorted the bars by clicking on the quick-sort button on the x-axis to sort the countries in descending order by total population.\nxnbe | Visualization - Tips and Types\nuv86 | The chart shown in the following screenshot is a stacked bar chart. In this chart, we have pivoted several fields in the previous two exercises to show, by region, the ten most populous countries in the world. The stacked bar chart is a part-to-whole comparison chart that often works better than a pie chart because it relies on the bar's lengths rather than an interpretation of the angles:\ngksi | Stacked bar charts are best used when there are just a few different dimensions, because too many dimensions and corresponding colors are difficult to interpret. We created this stacked bar chart by performing the following steps:\noh7q | One. Drag the Region field from the Dimensions pane to the Columns shelf.\n6gn8 | Two. Drag Population: Total count from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.\nyun5 | Three. Maintain the filters on Year for twenty ten and the top ten countries according to the total population.\nvdx2 | Four. Drag Country from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.\n4k9e | Five. Click on the Color shelf on the Marks card and add a black border, which separates the bars more definitively.\nkeds | Six. Click on the ABC icon in the toolbar to see the mark labels.\nugy5 | Chapter Four\nyhw8 | Geographic maps\no7zq | Geographic maps are a useful chart type that can answer various questions related to locations. Before you select this chart type, consider the fact that having geographic data elements such as longitude, latitude, state, county, city names, or addresses does not mean that you have to use them in every case. Sometimes, a bar chart or another chart type can express a data story as well as a geographic map in, case map data does not actually add value. For example, sometimes it is better to group states, counties, or cities into regions and treat those as categories by using bar charts.\nhqd5 | Tableau Public has a powerful geocoding function that is built-in and requires no additional programming. Geocoding is the process of recognizing geographic data, such as addresses, cities, counties, state country names, latitude, longitude, and so on, with the help of software and automatically encoding text strings and numeric values as geographic dimensions.\nsu3f | We built the following map to show the maximum life expectancy by country in the World Bank Indicators data set by performing the following steps:\ns1l7 | One. Multi-select Country in the Dimensions pane and Life Expectancy at Birth total in the Measures pane.\n12yz | Two. Click on the Show Me card.\n0xfx | Three. Select the filled map.\nbg91 | Four. On the Marks card, click on the context menu for Life Expectancy at Birth total and change it to a maximum, which means that it shows the maximum value for each country within the data set.\nbsog | Visualization - Tips and Types\no7e8 | Five. Click on the context menu for the Color Legend, click on Edit, and select a color palette that's friendly to people who are color-blind, as shown in the following screenshot:\nxjy8 | From this map, we learned that the countries of central Africa have relatively worst life expectancies in the world.\n6746 | When the data is loaded in Tableau Public, the software automatically encodes geographic fields with their average latitude and longitude. When you select one of these newly encoded fields, a small globe icon will be associated with the data element. You can click on one of the map icons on the Show Me dialog box, or you can double-click on any of those fields to add it to the visualization pane. The filled map icon is the most commonly used one for data visualizations.\nr5zg | Scatter plots\nhk56 | Scatter plots are a type of chart that show relationships between two measures to establish correlations and comparisons, find trends in data, and expose outliers. Scatter plots are one of the most effective forms of communicating mathematical relationships, and they are one of the seven basic tools of quality control.\n29ac | Chapter Four\nno4d | You can build a scatter plot by adding a measure to the Rows shelf and a measure to the Columns shelf, or double-clicking on each of the measures in succession- the first measure will be placed on the Rows shelf and the second one on the Columns shelf. You can swap the measures (rows swapped with columns) by pressing the control key and clicking on the measures and select the Swap menu command icon. Alternatively, you can right-click and click on Swap on the shortcut context menu. Then, add one or more dimensions to the Marks card, dragging various dimensions to the various shelves, such as Color, Size, or Shape. This will put the scattered measures in context with the dimensions and allow for an analysis of the relationships.",
