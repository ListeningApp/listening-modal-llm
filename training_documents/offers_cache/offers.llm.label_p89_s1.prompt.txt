You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

hthe | I took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point going forward, whenever someone said "but what about eating out ?? " I had the solution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more "one things" to prevent my sales. This lesson has stuck with me to this day. Don't get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that's so good, people just can't say no. And that's what we're building here.
otjm | Note: You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That's not to say that if you don't, you won't sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have. And that's the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest possible price, with the highest possible margin.
q0fv | Step #5: Trim & Stack
v9vo | Now that we have enumerated our potential solutions, we will have a gigantic list. Next, I look at the cost of providing these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low value items.
rwty | If you aren't sure what's high value, go through the value equation and ask yourself which of these things will this person:
ki97 | 1. Financially value
099j | 2. Cause them to believe they will be likely to succeed
m7zf | 3. Make them feel like they can do it with much less effort and sacrifice
2ghw | 4. Help them accomplish their goal and see the result they want with far less time investment.
hnfy | What should remain are offer items that are 1) low cost, high value and 2) high cost, high value.
w6d9 | Example: Let's say I moved in with someone and did their shopping, exercising, and cooking for them. They would probably believe they would definitely lose weight. But I am not willing to do that for any amount of money short of a gazillion dollars.
lbm8 | The next question becomes, is there a lesser version of this experience that I can deliver at scale?
krjy | Just take one step back at a time until you arrive at something that has a time commitment or cost you are willing to live with (or, obviously, massively increase your price so it becomes worth it for you - i.e., the gazillion dollars to live with someone).
n7dw | If there's one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it's creating high value, "one to many" solutions. These will be the ones that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value. For example, before I started my first gym, I had an online training business. I created a small excel sheet application that after inputting all of someone's goals, automatically generated over 100 meals perfectly suited to their macronutrient and calorie needs. Better yet, depending which meals they selected, would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts, and how to prepare them in bulk for their exact amounts. It took me about 100 hours to put the whole thing together. But from that point going forward I sold truly personalized eating plans for very expensive prices, but they only took me about 15minutes to make. High value. Low cost.
9nt1 | These types of solutions require a high, one-time cost of creation, but infinitely low additional effort after. (Fyi - This is exactly why software becomes so valuable).
fr45 | That doesn't mean you don't ever want to do something in a small group or one-on-one model. After all, I do 1-on-1 with all of my portfolio company CEOs that we help scale past $30m+. You just want to make sure you save those high cost items for big value adds only. If you think you can accomplish the same value with a lower cost alternative, then do that instead.
s2ty | When I was running my gym, I went through this exercise and created: bulking blueprints, an eating-out system, a travel eating and workout guide, meal plans for every bodyweight and gender, a grocery list calculator, plateau busting meal plans (for when they got stuck), fast cooking guides partnered with meal prep services, and did in-person nutrition orientations with every client one-on-one.
3cdb | Many of the "one to many" solutions require more up front work. Once created, however, they become valuable assets that create value in perpetuity. It's worth putting in the time to create these because they will create high margin profit for years to come.
6hsm | Real talk: the meal plans I made for my gym have been used by 4,000+ gyms now and literally hundreds of thousands of
om5d | people. They are simple and easy to follow. So they have provided ample return for the week or two of dedicated time I spent making them.
0svq | And if you ever have the desire to build a repeatable business model, something that scales, these assets you create will become the bedrock. This book, for example, is a high-value asset that is low cost overall. Sure, it costs me a lot up front, but each additional book I sell after my first one costs me very little and provides tremendous value.
1too | The Final High Value Deliverable
pti9 | Let's sum this up before we configure our final high value deliverable.
4mtx | Step #1: We figured out our prospective client's dream outcome.
rgxy | Step #2: We listed out all the obstacles they're likely to encounter on their way (our opportunities for value).
vsq9 | Step #3: We listed all those obstacles as solutions.
d5a1 | Step #4: We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions.
qtb8 | Step #5a: We trimmed those ways down to only the things that were the highest value and lowest cost to us. All we have to do now is ...
g395 | Step #5b: Put all the bundles together into the ultimate high value deliverable.
wfvy | So let's go back to the example. We see our prospects struggled with the following:
7yfb | I'm going to display each problem-solution set as:
3mmm | Problem -> Solution Wording-> Sexier Name for Bundle .

boyi | Total value: $4,351 (!) All for only $599.
9lwd | Author Note Most of our facilities now sell this bundle for longer periods of time for $2,400 to $5,200. Wild. As we got better at creating and monetizing value, the prices and profit of our facilities skyrocketed. Once you start down this value creation process, each additional piece of value you create stacks on top over time. This is why it is important to begin.
d2vd | Can you see how much more valuable this is than a gym membership? The bundle does three core things:
ow2p | 1. Solves all the perceived problems (not just some)
q5v1 | 2. Gives you the conviction that what you're selling is one of a kind (very important)
ty34 | 3. Makes it impossible to compare or confuse your business or offering with the one down the street
gzzp | Whew! We finally have what we are going to deliver in all its glory. That being said, it is unlikely we would present it in this way. Depending on whether we sell one on one or one to many, we would present this differently. I will address how to present each of these bundled items in the bonus section (next section).
kh7y | Summary Points
7xl2 | We went through this entire process to accomplish one objective: to create a valuable offer that is differentiated and unable to be compared to anything else in the marketplace. We are selling something unique. As such, we are no longer bound by the normal pricing forces of commoditization. Prospects will now only make a value-based rather than a price-based decision on whether they should buy from us. Hoorah!
53tr | Now that we have our core offer, the next section will be dedicated to enhancing it. We will employ a combination of psychological levers: bonuses, urgency, scarcity, guarantees, and naming.

nk6u | EVERY INFOMERCIAL IN THE 90S
ils9 | May 2019. Arnold Scwarzenegger's home.
jnec | A fter School All Stars Fundraiser. The line of cars outside Arnold's house was around the corner ... and we were in one of them. We were sitting in our Uber when a security guard with an earpiece, black suit, and black sunglasses knocked on the driver's window. It was like straight out of a movie.
hxy3 | The driver rolled down the window. "Name?" "Alex and Leila Hormozi."
3jn8 | He scanned the list on his clipboard, nodded, then checked off our names. "Great," he said. His demeanor transformed from stern to inviting. "Welcome to the fundraiser. Stay in this line. You'll make a left, then security will escort you the rest of the way."
sxz7 | The security guard talked into his walkie talkie to the next post down the road, signaling our car was approved.
o1qm | Pulling up to the front of the estate was like entering into a Bond movie. Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Ferraris, and brands of cars that are too expensive to even speak of. Old guys with young, scantily-clad girls. A-List Actors. Celebrities with millions of followers who were recording themselves as they arrived, talking through their iphones to their audiences. And us.
0wlv | The fundraiser was $25,000 per ticket to attend, with an invite list of only 100. There was a red carpet and all. Every year, the fundraiser culminated in a big auction for memorabilia and items some of the business owners in the audience gave away for charity.
d6bc | We walked around looking at the entertainment stations purposely devised to get donors in the "giving mood." We saw $10,000 scotches . . . $500 cigars . . . pre-released items from major brands that wouldn't be available to the public until months later. And, of course, the most expensive cuisine you could imagine. Leila and I were just soaking it all in. It was a wonderful night. We definitely felt like cool kids.
z27p | Ben, the CEO of the charity, saw us looking lost and walked over. He took me by the arm to introduce me to some of the other donors. These were all men who were older than me and donating $100,000 and up without a second thought.
7sdk | The man he introduced me to was one of the charity's biggest donors. He had built an ultra-high end jewelry and watch business. I'm talking $100,000, $500,000, $2,000,000+ rare status symbols that people buy only so other .001 percenters know they belong. He had donated upwards of $700,000 in merchandise as prizes for the fundraiser that evening.
r5ct | "Alex and Leila, meet George," Ben said. "He's been very generous with his time and money to the cause. George, this is Alex and Leila Hormozi. They're donating $1,000,000 tonight to ASAS. I figured you are both good people and wanted to connect you two."
t5nr | "Nice to meet you both," George said with calm, weathered eyes. He was in his late sixties, tall and sturdily built. You could hear his eastern block origins in his accent. He sounded like a man who had fought tooth and nail to be here, but had softened his demeanor for gatherings such as these. But the tiger with teeth and claws remained under the surface, ready to be called upon at a moment's notice. I felt like I understood this guy.
xiwq | Ben broke the ice. "So .... George was the one who got me to raise the price from $15,000 per ticket to $25,000. We had more demand than ever this year. But I took his advice. I cut the amount of tickets we sold and raised the prices."
iivy | "That's right," said George, content that his sage business advice had been followed.
kn8m | "When demand increases, cut supply." He perked up slightly as we talked about money.
vqoi | This man had built his business from nothing and had found ways to sell things for extraordinary profits by understanding human psychology. I had long learned about supply and demand, but this guy was using its psychological underpinnings to fuel a fundraising. You could take the tiger out of the jungle, but not the jungle out of the tiger.
