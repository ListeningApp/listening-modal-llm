        "content": "lqjf | One important aspect in working with your inner critic and being able to reduce the impact of its harsh ways is learning how to translate its message. When we engage in dialogue with this part of us and inquire into why it is so persistent, more times than not, we find that it is trying to protect us-from harm, from looking\n7z7b | bad, from being disliked or from failing in some way. Stated more positively, this part of us is usually trying to keep us safe and to assure us that we are getting some form of love, acceptance or social inclusion. The irony here is that even though its intention is positive, its methods of self-scolding, shoulding or shaming are seriously counterproductive to the cause. However, when we are able to identify the positive and protective intention that our inner critic has for us, we can gain the power to translate its intention.\ntv8z | Let's look at an example. When I hear my inner critic say that bringing up that I'm hurt by something to my partner is petty of me and that I'm being overly sensitive or needy, I can get curious about what this part of me is trying to do. In this case, my inner critic is trying to keep me from getting further hurt based on the fear that if I reveal myself, I won't be cared for and listened to in the way I need and I will ultimately lose the relationship for having needs (yes, this is a history of neglect speaking). At that moment, if I am mindful of it, I can first give myself what I need, which is acknowledgment and acceptance of what I'm feeling and some self-care. I am able to translate the inner critic and then be my own safe haven through some self-connection and soothing. This then allows me to approach my partner from a position of advocating for my needs, rather than from the voice of the inner critic.\nwj6v | Dick Schwartz, the developer of the Internal Family Systems Model, makes an important distinction that in relationships we can speak for our parts, but should be careful not to speak from them. When I speak directly from my inner critic, I am likely to be blaming my partner or myself, which pushes us further apart. If I am able to speak for the part of me that has been hurt, more possibility opens up for both of us to be understood and get our needs met. Initially, doing the work of translating our inner critic takes diligence. The inner critic is usually a persistent old habit that is well-established in the neural networks of our brains, so expecting change overnight is not realistic. But identifying the inner critic's larger intention, not believing what it says and translating its voice over and over again eventually pays off and is well worth the effort.\nax4d | Managing triggers is another important component of creating secure attachment with yourself. Triggers are events that happen in the present that activate painful or traumatic experiences from our past that have some resemblance to what's happening in the present moment. When this happens, it's extremely difficult to tease apart what we are reacting to in this moment that is real and legitimate and what past stuff is coloring our interpretation and reactivity.\ngtbn | Millions of years of evolution have wired into us a stress response that is meant to keep us alive in life-threatening situations. When we feel threatened, our primitive reptilian brain and our emotional mammalian brain systems fire up to either fight and defend ourselves, flee and quickly escape, freeze and play dead, or appease and submit. This has been a very necessary system to help us first detect if our environment is safe or dangerous and then to instantaneously react accordingly. But, interestingly, our brains can't distinguish between a physical threat to our life and an emotional or mental threat to our ego, identity or worldview. So, when we think we've made a mistake, when someone challenges our worldview or when we presume that someone is going to judge or reject us, we can get triggered into a fight, flight, freeze, appease response. In today's world, it's not a ferocious animal that poses a threat, but your partner on the couch texting with someone else or your date being twenty minutes late. But your body can respond in the same way as if your life were threatened.\nui4d | Our bodies were not designed for the daily stressors of modern life or to be triggered on a regular basis, so it's important to our mental and physical health that we learn to manage triggers. I've come to see trigger management as a basic life skill that we all need for the health and success of any relationship-whether with a family member, friend, co-worker, parent or romantic partner. Then I started to work with nonmonogamous people and I transitioned to being polyamorous myself, and understanding our triggers and knowing how to defuse our reactivity became even more relevant. In nonmonogamy, we need more skills around our triggers because as the number of people increases, the constellation of intimate relationships complexifies. For many, this relational complexity can be very\n2h4x | beautiful and rich-it can feed those of us who want deeper community and tribe-but it can also bring many more opportunities for our triggers to get activated with each different lover, metamour, and family member or friend of your partners that comes along.\n0s3f | In nonmonogamy, we can also get completely blind-sided with triggers that we didn't even know we had-triggers that never would have shown up within the context of monogamy. That said, my experience has taught me that our triggers can be a gift. Of course, it never feels like a gift in the moment of being triggered, but if we can approach our triggers with curiosity and learn to shift into being responsive instead of acting from knee-jerk reactivity, our triggers become an amazing opportunity to strengthen and deepen our relationship with ourselves and with our partners. Just as how we want to speak for our parts instead of from them, we also want to learn how to respond to our triggers instead of reacting from them. Understanding and inquiring into your triggers can be a powerful way to heal past pain and transform outdated beliefs or stories that you might still be stuck in. Working with your triggers can free you up to live your life and conduct your relationships based on your preferred expressions of self-living from love, connection and choice instead of automatic reactions.\n1ajd | Questions to Consider\nqj5b | . How do you treat yourself when you make a mistake or fall short of your own standards and expectations?\n15wh | . How do you respond to yourself when you have an inner conflict?\nad3x | . How would you like to treat yourself differently?\n6zdx | . What would become possible for you if you did this?\nlwg2 | . How frequently are you getting triggered and how does this impact you?\nzsvp | . What could you do to better manage your triggers, both preventively and during an actual trigger?\nssmj | Things to Try and to Experiment With\nnda1 | . When your inner critic arises, try engaging in dialogue with it instead of just\n5mk0 | believing it. Ask what it wants for you and if it is trying to protect you in any way. You can do this verbally, internally or in writing. Keep engaging with it until you get to a positive intention that it is holding for you. Once you have this positive intention, you can then experiment with translating the inner critic any time it arises again.\n5bgd | . Seek support through books, programs, training or with a professional to work with your inner critic and to manage your triggers.\nm3bl | No matter how triggered, anxious or out of control you feel, it's important to know that you can change your arousal system and calm yourself. Mindful deep belly breathing (even for just sixty seconds) is an effective way to decrease heightened arousal and return your body to a state of homeostasis.",
