You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

Endorsers watched either the bittersweet Life Is Beautiful clip <LATEX>\left( n = 2 2 \right)</LATEX> or the control clip <LATEX>\left( n = 2 4 \right)</LATEX> by random assignment. After providing the cover story, the experimenter left and subjects watched the clip. After the clip, the experimenter told subjects that she needed to ask a few questions about their emotional reactions to the film because emotions can affect language comprehension. She first asked, "How do you feel right now?" Throughout, whenever subjects mentioned an emotion, the experimenter asked them to explain why they felt that way if they had not spontaneously done so. If they mentioned positive or negative emotions only in response to the first question, she asked, "Do you feel anything else?"8 At this point, the experimenter confirmed any reports of mixed emotions by asking, "So you feel happy and sad?" (When applicable, the experimenter replaced "happy" and "sad" with the positive and negative emotions mentioned by the subject.) No subjects who initially reported mixed emotions subsequently denied them.
90no | Results and discussion. We distinguished between subjects who reported mixed emotions spontaneously after being asked "How do you feel right now?" and those who reported mixed emotions only after being asked "Do you feel anything else?" The percentage of subjects in each group who reported mixed emo- tions, reported mixed emotions spontaneously, and reported simul- taneously mixed emotions is shown in Table 5. Chi-square tests revealed effects of condition on all three measures, <LATEX>\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 2 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>N =</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 9 0 \right) = 1 4 . 6 9 ,</LATEX> 7.85, and 7.86, Cramér's <LATEX>V = . 4 5 ,</LATEX> .33, and .33, respectively, all <LATEX>p s < . 0 3 .</LATEX> Follow-up Fisher's exact tests indicated that endorsers who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely than endorsers who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 4 8 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> and report simultaneously mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 3 6 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 2 \right) ,</LATEX> after correcting for familywise error rate. Endorsers who watched the bittersweet clip were also mar- ginally more likely to spontaneously report mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = \right.</LATEX> .32, <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 4 \right) .</LATEX> Nonendorsers, all of whom watched the bittersweet clip, were more likely than endorsers who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 5 4 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p < . 0 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> spontaneously report mixed emotions <LATEX>\left( \varphi = . 4 0 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. p = . 0 0 5 \right) ,</LATEX> and report simulta- neously mixed emotions
jt0y | Thus, whether or not they initially endorsed the notion that people could feel happy and sad at the same time, individuals who watched the bittersweet clip were more likely to report mixed emotions than those who watched the control clip. These results provide further evidence against the contention that people report mixed emotions in bittersweet situations only because they think that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. More generally, Study 6's results, like those of Studies 4 and 5, provide evidence against the reactive measurement hypothesis and for the contention that happiness and sadness can co-occur.
qb7o | General Discussion
oae5 | When it comes to the experience of emotion, is valence irre- ducible or are positivity and negativity separable? We addressed this question with six studies designed to test whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Subjects reported their emotions during (Studies 1-3) or after clips (Studies 4-6) from a tragicomic film containing bittersweet scenes or a combination of unambiguously pleasant and unpleasant scenes. At first glance, the results of all six studies indicate that the incidence of mixed emotions is low. In Studies 1b and 3, for instance, the majority of subjects never reported mixed emotions for so much as a second over the course of a nearly 20-min film clip. In Studies <LATEX>4 - 6 ,</LATEX> 84% did not report experiencing simultaneously mixed emotions after the clips. Thus, our data may provide the strongest evidence to date that people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time.
s0fl | A closer look at the data, however, provides even stronger evidence for a more nuanced conclusion. Compared with those who watched the control clip, people who watched the bittersweet clip spent more time pressing the happy and sad buttons simulta- neously in Studies 1a and 3, moved further into the interior of the continuous ESG in Studies 1b and 2, were more likely to list mixed emotions in Study 4, were more likely to describe feeling mixed emotions in Study 5, and were more likely to tell an interviewer
43ia | that they felt mixed emotions in Study 6. Thus, the data indicate that people do not often feel happy and sad at the same time but can do so in bittersweet situations.
3g2y | Taken together, the data extend prior evidence against the con- tention of Bain (1859), Wundt (1896), and Titchener (1908) that valence is an irreducible aspect of the experience of emotion. In contrast, the findings provide evidence for the contention of So- crates, Hume (1739/2000), and Ebbinghaus (1902; cited in Wohlgemuth, 1919) that positivity and negativity are separable in experience. In terms of their implications for contemporary models of the structure of affect, the data are inconsistent with Russell's (1980; Russell & Carroll, 1999) valence-arousal model but con- sistent with Cacioppo and Berntson's (1994; Cacioppo et al., 2004) ESM.
