        "content": "5gil | These scarcity tactics work especially well for higher ticket upsells. If you want to create one off workshops, trainings, events, seminars, consulting, etc. These are things that by their nature take time and provide more access. Paring them with clear scarcity or fixed amounts, seats, or spots will rapidly drive up the demand. But always remember have less spots available than you think you can sell ... so that when you want to do it again in the future, everyone will remember you sold out ... fast. This is a compounding strategy that increases in effectiveness over time. One of the few in the marketing arsenal.\nn91l | Let me give you a real example of scarcity to enhance the value of a free lead magnet. If I were to tell you right now that I have a checklist that you can download for free that has all these materials for you in this book in bulleted format, you might be inclined to put this book down and go there to download it now.\niknb | But, if I told you I have it set so that every week the page only allows twenty new people to download it, you'd be far more likely to go see if you can grab it. And even more so if when you try it, you see that it has already run out for the week. Result? You join a list that notifies you the next time twenty more checklists become available for download. What happens next? When you get that notification, you'll hit the link on your phone and go to the page because you don't want to miss out again.\n3ohm | By employing scarcity, we make what would otherwise be a \"neat free download\" into a desirable thing not everyone has access to. You also, by extension, would be far more likely to consume it when you do get your hands on it ... all because of how we controlled supply. Cool, right?\nenn6 | Honest Scarcity (The Most Ethical Scarcity)\nvoir | The easiest scarcity strategy is honesty. Wait, what? Let me explain.\nbxm5 | I'm sure right now, you probably couldn't handle one thousand clients tomorrow right? But how many could you handle? Five? Ten? Twenty-five? Well, you might as well define a number that you are willing to take on in a given time period, then advertise that. Simply letting people know that you are three-fourths of the way to capacity this week will move people over the edge to buying from you. Or letting people know that you are eighty-one percent to capacity in your total business, will make people more likely to sign up with you \"before they lose the chance.\" Scarcity also implies within it, social proof. If you are eighty-one percent to capacity then a decent amount of people made the decision to work with you, and the closer you get to your arbitrary fullness, the faster the spots will disappear. But only you get to draw where that line is \"full.\" Neat right?\n6cnd | Summary Points\nz41z | Employ one or multiple methods of scarcity in your business. You will drive a faster purchasing decision from your prospects, and at higher prices. Just let them know your limits and let psychology do the rest.\nk1hn | Now that we've covered some of my favorite scarcity tactics that you can use year round, what else could you do to increase demand without changing anything about your offer? Increase urgency. We will cover that next.\n853d | Pro Tip - Extreme Scarcity\npx3f | If you don't hate money, sell a very limited supply of one on one access. You can do that via any of the mediums described in \"Delivery Cube.\" Direct message access. Email Access. Phone access. Voice memo access. Zoom access. Etc. There are lots of ways you can do this. But I promise you this - if you want to immediately make a lot of money, create a very exclusive service level based on access to you (yes, unscalable), that you cap at a tiny number. Price it very high. Then, tell people. You will make more money than you thought possible. These also tend to be some of the best clients. And limit your delivery to something that you don't hate. For me, I hate emails and messages but don't mind zoom calls. Make it work for your working style. The cream of the crop (the one percent of one percent will adjust and take action).\n28wa | Pro Tip - Once You're Out, You Can Never Come Back\n1jce | You can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave they can never return. This type of scarcity makes people think extra hard about leaving. I started doing this with my gyms early on. Then I was in a mastermind that employed this. Then I started using it in my higher level of Gym Lords. This works best with small groups (like the above example). As groups become much bigger, the tactic loses some teeth.\njfbn | ENHANCING THE OFFER: URGENCY\ncn1a | URGENCY (BY X DATE) Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One ... DONE!\n0j5u | RELATES TO TIME\nu6dp | Scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time.\nhnb4 | This is where you only limit when people can sign up, rather than how many. Having a defined deadline or cut off for a purchase or action to occur creates urgency. Frequently, scarcity and urgency are used together, but I will separate them out for you to illustrate the concepts.\na0sw | I'm going to show you my four favorite ways of using urgency on a consistent basis, ethically: one) Rolling Cohorts, two) Rolling Seasonal Urgency, and three) Promotional or Pricing Urgency four) Exploding Opportunity. They will employ urgency in your business without being phony. My favorite way of doing this is having cohorts of clients start on a regular cadence. This has the added operational benefit of helping you create a choreographed onboarding experience for new clients. As you scale, this will become increasingly important.\naak4 | One) Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency\n7l7y | For example, if you start clients every week (even in unlimited amounts), you can say:\np1kn | \"If you sign up today, I can get you in with our next group that kicks off on Monday, otherwise you'll have to wait until our next kickoff date.\"\n49ym | If you wanted to juice it up a little bit, you could say:\nabvj | \"I actually had a client who signed up a few weeks ago drop out, so I have an opening for our next cohort that kicks off on Monday. If you are pretty sure you're gonna do this sooner or later, might as well get in on it now so you can start reaping the rewards sooner rather than paying the same and waiting.\"\nk4xq | Those two tweaks above have pushed so many sales over the edge by just reminding a potential customer that if they sign up, they will be starting on Monday, and if they do not, they will have to wait a week. It's small things like this that nudge people to take the action they know they should take anyways.\nok5a | Obviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is. For example, if you only start clients two times a year, people will be very inclined to sign up, especially as the date approaches. Even starting new clients every other week can confer this urgency nudge.\n2ngm | What if I lose sales by turning business away?\nmtp1 | Just like guarantees, there is always a fear that you will make less money by employing this strategy. We are afraid that we will lose sales we would have otherwise made. Every experienced marketer on the planet will tell you - it is a fear, and it is unfounded. The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last four hours of the last day (up to fifty to sixty percent). That means that the last three percent of the time allotted creates fifty to sixty percent of the sales ... that's completely illogical, but also unmistakably human. So, just like a guarantee, you will make more money from the many people who decided to take action than people who actually missed out because in reality, those people were never going to buy.",
