You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

835g | the same mode applied to similar situations may produce two opposing reactions in two different clients. A client's reactions are less a function of the mode choice and more a function of the interpersonal characteristics and imme- diate needs of the client. The case example at the begin- ning of this chapter illustrates this point with respect to the instructing mode. When Kamisha explained why she was asking Margarita questions about her daily occupa- tions and roles, Margarita's daughter reacted negatively, whereas Margarita appeared to accept the explanation as being valid. It is important to keep in mind that modes are perceived, relativistic, and subjective. As such, they are best interpreted through the mind's eye of the client. Rather than the mode itself, the client's interpretation and experi- ence of the mode is what determines which mode is most desirable at any given time.
x3l9 | Carrying this point a step further, it is even possible that the same mode applied to similar situations may produce vastly different reactions in the same client. For example, when Rigel used the instructing mode to ed- ucate Mr. Johnson about the assessment he was using, Mr. Johnson's nonverbal cues revealed that he was not interested (refer to the case example in Chapter 1). How- ever, when Rigel used the same mode to explain the con- cept of brain plasticity as justification for why his early engagement in therapy is likely to facilitate functional improvement, Mr. Johnson's body language became more positive. Ultimately, he invites Rigel to return to work with him on the following day.
d2fj | Because therapists naturally select and use modes that are most consistent with their interpersonal styles in everyday life, the use of therapeutic modes is as diverse and complex as the therapists who use them. All modes have equal potential to enable a functional therapeutic relation- ship. However, any mode may have a negative effect on a client's attitudes and feelings toward the therapist if used:
geyi | Too frequently or inflexibly
2181 | When the timing is not right for the client
9ubl | When the mode is not consistent with the client's inter- personal needs in the moment
o8pj | When the mode is not changed so as to be more consis- tent with the client's interpersonal needs of the moment
27b9 | In the worst cases, overreliance on a particular mode with a client can result in negative consequences for the ther- apy process and for the client.
09xa | Your therapeutic style is defined by the primary mode or set of modes that you tend to utilize most often during interactions with clients. It is important to recognize that some therapists' styles reflect the use of one primary mode or set of modes, whereas other therapists incorporate a much wider range of modes into their approach. For this reason, the therapeutic modes are presented in this section in alphabetical order to underscore that no single mode is superior to another. Key points regarding each of the modes and examples of how they are typically enacted are summarized in Table 4.1. The table contains a general description of each mode, examples of phrases a therapist might use when communicating with the mode, examples of questions a therapist might ask when communicating with the mode, recommendations for facial expressions and body language that would be consistent with the mode, and ideas for how a mode might be implemented in practice.
yi97 | The points describing each mode are guidelines, not rules. They were included to stimulate creative thinking about a wide range of interpersonal behaviors that could potentially converge to form a therapeutic style. As you learn more about each mode, you may begin to form some of your own thoughts and ideas about interpersonal be- haviors that you typically utilize that reflect a given mode but are not explicitly described in this section. This type of thinking is encouraged because it promotes critical self-awareness and greater insight into your own unique therapeutic style.
4zj7 | Advocating Mode
3wgh | The advocating mode is becoming more prevalent as ther- apists become aware of and embrace the perspective that disability is a function of environmental barriers rather than client impairments. Therapists using the advocating mode work to ensure that clients have the personal, ma- terial, and interpersonal resources they need for maximal participation in productivity, leisure, and all other daily life activities. It includes ensuring that clients have access to housing, transportation, education, equal opportunities for employment, assistive devices, personal assistants, and any other resources pertinent to their independence and well-being. Functioning in the mode of advocate often involves being a facilitator or defender of justice, rather than in the more traditional roles in which the occupa- tional therapist guides, questions, listens, or administers a service (Fig. 4.4).

kva7 | Problem- Solving
ssp0 | Therapists functioning in the advocating mode are quick to recognize and respond to the physical, social, and occu- pational barriers that their clients encounter. They are care- ful not to undermine their clients' autonomy, dignity, sense of personal power, and capacity to judge what is in their own best interest by functioning in an expert role. They are also careful about being misperceived by clients as someone interested in fixing or rehabilitating them. At the same time, therapists functioning as advocates can be ardent and force- ful activists and promoters on behalf of their clients when the circumstances require it. Some engage in consciousness- raising with their clients about their legal rights, and some utilize their professional capacity to testify on behalf of a client in a legal situation or to broker access to services or resources to which a client is entitled. Additionally, thera- pists using this mode will seek opportunities to bring clients together in community with their disabled peers, and also normalize their clients' experiences and impairments as a part of the natural continuum of human experience.

Those who function in the advocating mode go out of their way for their clients to provide them with access to vital resources that ensure physical mobility and access, socialization, equal participation, and appropriate work or educational opportunities. Occupational therapists are most often called on to function in the advocating mode when they recognize the advantages of raising a client's awareness of an injustice or when clients are themselves unable to overcome social and economic barriers without additional resources.
