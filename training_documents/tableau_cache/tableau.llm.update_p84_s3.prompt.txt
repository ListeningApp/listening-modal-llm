You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

wxdu | Line graphs show data trends over time. Line charts, along with bar charts, are the most popular chart types used in data visualizations. For this type of time series chart, place a time or date dimension on the Columns shelf and a measure on the Rows shelf (the horizontal line chart is the most commonly used/ useful line chart).
zdfh | Line charts can then be modified and made more complex by adding a dimension on the Color shelf, which adds one or more additional lines to the chart. You can add different measures to the Color shelf as well and measures or dimensions on the Size shelf. But usually, adding too much complexity to the graph detracts from the understanding of the data. The following steps will help you create a line graph:
i1dq | 1. Create a line graph that shows the average military expenditures as a percentage of the GDP between 2000 and 2010 by loading the World Bank Indicators data.
hwux | 2. Then, drag Date to the Columns shelf from the Dimensions pane.
9opd | 3. Drag Region from the Dimensions pane to the Color shelf.
sco5 | 4. Drag Military Expenditures (% GDP) from the Measures pane to the Rows shelf.
8wy0 | 5. Click on the context menu on the pill for Military Expenditures (% GDP) and select average the measure, as shown in the following screenshot:

yuul | Continuous versus discrete date-time elements
n7uk | This section on line charts is a good place to discuss continuous versus discrete date-time elements. Line charts can be set up either with a continuous time series, or a discrete time series. Most line charts used for visualizations are continuous and unbroken, as the one in this section is. However, time can also be set as discrete, and this will break apart the time series into sections (also called panes or panels), such as by year, quarter, and month. Dashboards are sometimes developed with a discrete time series to allow for a fast comparison of quarters or months. A time-data element can be set as discrete or continuous by right-clicking on the date-time data element and setting it to continuous or discrete. Doing so will radically change the line chart by switching to either a continuous line or a broken line based on the parts of the date selected. Most journalists and bloggers who use Tableau Public will want to use the continuous feature of date-time data to create unbroken line graphs, but experiment with continuous and discrete to check whether it adds value for your readers.
aeaj | Tables
tlut | Tables are usually created to show a fine level of detail for your data. In most business organizations, people have traditionally consumed analytics created in tabular reports, which can be highly inefficient. Tables display counts or measures relative to categorical variables, such as department spending, the number of college graduates in a city, pollution levels in a stream, and so on. They are useful when you wish to look up individual data point values and compare them across one or more levels of dimensional detail. Tables are the most effective when they are used at a high level and they contain data summaries rather than very long and detailed tables. You should also add filters to table charts to narrow down the data displayed to give readers a focus point. Tables are often called crosstabs. Pivot tables are a specific type of table; they are not discussed here.
izqq | There are three table views in Tableau -text tables (sometimes called crosstabs), highlight tables, and heat maps. Any of these three chart types can be selected and modified easily from one chart to another, or added to and varied as needed. The text table is a good place to start experimenting when building a table.

milo | The tables on the US government's spending were obtained from Tableau Software. Download the Tableau Public workbook from Tableau by visiting http://tinyurl.com/1962-2012spending and download the source data from Tableau Software by visiting http: //tinyurl. com/spending-source-data.
hs4w | Text tables are common tables, as seen in excel, for instance. This type of chart is available for creation from the top row of the Show Me tool. The following screenshot is an example of a text table. This is a simple table that shows the US government's spending as a percentage of the total spending per Department, for the US President's administration. For the table, we set the SUM(Percent of Total Spending) to the Text shelf, and this exposes the numeric values in the table rows and columns.
voba | Note that the details of the spending (the numeric values) are easily seen, and there is no highlighting or context around the values (in terms of telling the reader whether the numbers are high or low). No shape or color marks are used. Also note that we set up various filters on the Filter shelf for this table view, including filters for only the top spending departments, and also limited to the last three presidential administrations (Clinton, Bush, and Obama). Because the data is only current through 2012 (and Obama started his first presidential term in 2009), we also set up a filter for Administration Year and filtered to show only years 1 to 4 corresponding to each president's 4-year term of office. This lets us compare equal numbers of years for each president:

q342 | The heat maps are tables that are used to communicate visual cues such as shape and area by referring to up to two quantity measures. The larger the shape (and usually, the deeper the color), the higher the measure value. This type of chart is available for creation from the top row of the Show Me tool. The following graphic is an example of a heat map, with the SUM(Spending) on the Color shelf (in this case, the darker the red color gradient, the more dollars were spent) and the SUM(% of Total Spending) is tied to the Size shelf (this controls the size of the square). In this case, the larger the square, the more the percentage of the total spending for each government department during successive US presidential administrations. The actual values of spending are obscured here so that the reader is not able to quickly compare the actual values.
au1k | The colors used can be easily customized for each graph by double-clicking on the gradient color bar titled SUM(Spending). The shape can be customized by selecting another shape in the dropdown list under the Marks title section. Filters that were similar to the Text table were set up. But this time, no filtering for presidents was created. All the presidents listed in the source data set are represented, from Kennedy to Obama, as shown in the following screenshot:
jt2s | Chapter 4
p530 | Highlight tables are often thought of as heat maps to the industry, as they use color gradient depth, saturation, or hue to highlight a quantity measure (such as highs and lows). The difference between a highlight table and a heat map is the lack of shape and size marks and the ability to see the underlying details in the highlight table. The following screenshot is an example of a highlight table. Note that the darker the color hue, the greater the percentage of spending to the total. The SUM(% of Total Spending) is duplicated in the Marks card for both the Color shelf and the Text shelf. This allows the color hue to be affected in proportion to the numeric value and also lets the value itself be shown in the rows and columns.
zxwg | The colors used, and the other borders and elements, are completely customizable in the tables described in this section. The colors of this chart can be easily customized for each graph by double-clicking on the gradient color bar titled (in this case) SUM(% of Total Spending). The filters that have been created are identical to the first table named the Text table in this chapter section:
