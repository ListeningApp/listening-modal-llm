        "content": "8hul | The coastal Pacific hake stock is characterised by low recruitment punctuated by very strong year classes, leading to highly variable estimates of catch at maximum sustainable yield. The fishery is managed to sustain the stock through these fluctuations in recruitment. The forty-ten percent rule, which decreases allowable catch from the maximum sustainable yield rule when the spawning stock is below forty percent of modeled average unfished biomass, providing a precautionary mechanism to curtail harvest when the stock is low, had been used in the Pacific Fishery Management Council process for many years before being written into the Treaty. The Joint Management Committee determines total allowable catch by considering current stock status, uncertainties in the data and model projections and the potential effect on future stock status, while limited by the F forty percent default harvest rate and the forty-ten percent rule. The coast-wide fishery, on average, has attained eighty-five percent of the total allowable catch in the most recent years, mostly due to unused tribal allocation and bycatch restrictions.\n87vz | A final challenge to the management of Pacific hake is the potential overlap of the coastal stock and its fishery with other smaller stocks. An overlap is unlikely to be a major risk biologically for the large coastal stock but could be biologically risky to the other, smaller stocks, depending on the fishing mortality experienced by those stocks.\nym66 | Nine point five. Monitoring\nl0a3 | Nine point five point one. Fishery observing\nu8nw | As with most other commercial trawl fisheries on the U.S. west coast, the U.S. Pacific hake fishery is currently fully monitored by observers both for total\nl2v9 | catch and to account for bycatch of other fish stocks. Observers also collect biological samples for stock assessment-related scientific work. The U.S. fishery observers began monitoring Pacific hake catch on foreign vessels in 1977, more than two decades before most other U.S. west coast fisheries carried observers. Domestic catcher-processors and at-sea processing vessels, or motherships, voluntarily began carrying observers in 1991, in what was essentially an outgrowth of the observing conducted on many of these same vessels in the Alaska walleye pollock fishery. From 2004 to 2010, vessels delivering Pacific hake to shoreside plants operated under an electronic monitoring program that required no at-sea discarding of catch, at-sea monitoring using cameras and catch monitors at the shoreside processing facilities to record catch and bycatch. Since 2011, comprehensive observer coverage in the U.S. Pacific hake fishery has been mandatory, with human observers onboard catcher-processors, motherships, catcher vessels delivering to motherships and catcher vessels delivering to shoreside plants; there are also port samplers that monitor the catch delivered to shoreside plants.\n78r8 | Canada first deployed fishery observers on foreign vessels targeting Pacific hake in 1987. Since 1996, on-board observers have monitored and sampled the catch of all domestic groundfish vessels, and all landed catch from trawlers is subject to a dockside monitoring program. Currently, surveillance and monitoring measures include a combination of at-sea observers, ten to one hundred percent coverage, on vessels fishing for Pacific hake in Canadian waters, for headed-gutted freezer vessels, one hundred percent at-sea observer coverage is required; electronic monitoring, such as deck cameras, and full retention of all fish brought on board; and one hundred percent dockside, offload, monitoring. This monitoring program is supplemented by coast-wide surveillance via over-flights by fishery enforcement officers and patrol vessels.\n320g | Nine point five point two. Fishery-independent surveys\ntp8g | The adult stock of coastal Pacific hake has been surveyed acoustically starting in, although earlier surveys covered only part of the coastal stock's range. The stock was surveyed on a triennial basis from 1977 through 2001 with a switch to a biennial schedule from 2003 to 2011. A supplemental survey was conducted in 2012, followed by the regular biennial survey in 2013. Surveys between 1977 and 1992 were conducted entirely by the NOAA's Alaska Fisheries Science Center. In 1995, the operation became a joint United States-Canada survey with the addition of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Pacific Biological Station, and in 2003, NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center took over the U.S. portion of the survey.\ngxfd | The acoustic survey is conducted in the summer months, from mid-June through early September, typically moving south to north from Monterey, California, to Dixon Entrance, Alaska, using a design that covers waters from about fifty to fifteen hundred meters deep along parallel transects at ten-nautical mile spacing. The parallel transect design was developed when computing power and\ns2v1 | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\njkp9 | analytical techniques designed to minimise or remove spatial and/or temporal autocorrelation in data were limited. Recent surveys have used geostatistical analysis techniques, i.e. kriging, to compute biomass and variance, and as a result, zigzag transects or other less-regular transect designs could be used in the future. In some years, the survey has had to extend farther south or north in response to observed hake aggregations to cover the entire extent of the stock. The survey was expanded in the nineteen nineties to include northern and offshore areas of the hake distribution that had not been included in the original survey design, and a set of expansion factors were calculated in an attempt to calibrate the early survey data years so that they would be roughly comparable to the updated survey design. However, this proved an unresolvable task given the natural variation in northern migration between years.\nz8tt | The survey relies on thirty-eight kilohertz as the primary acoustic frequency to estimate Pacific hake biomass, although additional frequencies as available on the U.S. and Canadian survey vessels are also used to help distinguish hake from other acoustic targets. Acoustic backscatter attributed to Pacific hake is scaled to biomass or abundance using a length-based model of target strength, the log-transformed acoustic backscatter expected from a single fish or unit biomass. In 1995, this model was changed from a weight-based target strength of negative thirty-five decibels per kilogram to a target strength-length relation of target strength equals twenty logarithm length minus sixty-eight, where length is fork length in centimetres. Variability in Pacific hake target strength has continued to be an active area of research; data from the most recent field measurements were generally consistent with mean and variation indicated in nineteen ninety-six.",
