You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

uz3c | Transducing substantia nigra dopamine neurons with genes related to human Parkinson's disease has been explored to provide valuable animal models of the disease. AAV carrying cDNA of human WT «-syn injected to the substantia nigra induces slowly progressing neurodegeneration and the presence of «-syn inclusions [70,71]. These models have been used in mice [72-74] and rats. A study using both human WT or mutant A53T «-syn carried in recombinant AAV-CBA (chicken ß-actin) injected into the substantia nigra of rats showed a loss of striatal TH fibre density and dopamine and degeneration of TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra. Furthermore, in animals with a significant loss of TH in the nigral area, severe behavioural deficits developed at 24-27 weeks post-injection, as compared with GFP controls [75]. Studies using WT human «-syn with AAV6 [76], AAV5 [77], and AAV9 [78] injected to the nigra have shown TH loss in the nigrostriatal system and motor deficits. In addition, recombinant AAV human WT «-syn injection to rats has resulted in the phosphorylation of endogenous «-syn in the substantia nigra area [79]. However, in [80], the authors observed that x-syn phosphorylated at Ser129 is not necessary for pathology in the dopamine system and deficits in motor behaviour and therefore, WT human -syn is enough to cause dysfunction. For the mutant forms, AAV5-S129D and S129A [80], AAV2-A53T [81], and AAV6-A30P [82] have been tested in rats and compared to the WT form. A large study compared the model in mice, rats, and monkeys, wherein AAV9 human mutant A53T x-syn was injected into the substantia nigra, and found that there was degeneration in the nigrostriatal areas in all species and motor deficits in rats, but interestingly aging did not exacerbate the loss or symptoms [83]. A long-term study was performed with a variety of pathology and behavioural measures, in which the authors used AAV7 carrying human WT or mutant (A53T) «-syn and injected it into the substantia nigra [84]. The results showed that this mutant form was able to induce behavioural deficits on rotarod and cylinder tests, induce dopamine cell death in the substantia nigra, decrease dopamine release in the striatum, and also form insoluble aggregates [84]. A recent study in rats using human WT «-syn with four and eight week time points did not show TH loss in the striatum at 4 weeks, but did show a mild loss of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and decreased dopamine content at eight weeks after vector injections [85]. While most of these studies do show some loss of TH and robust «-syn expression, which are important in modelling the disease, in some cases, AAV carrying GFP or other control results were not shown as a comparison. Additionally, many of these studies use enhancers for the transgene expression levels. It should also be noted that it is a mutant form of human «-syn in certain studies, not the WT, which demonstrates TH loss and motor deficits in the animals. In Table 1 we have summarized these studies, in which a GFP control was most often used as a comparison to the AAV-x-syn.
d5bi | In general, though some of the previous studies were able to recapitulate the disease, there is still large variability between and within studies, including our own findings [65]. Additionally, without a control for a comparison of dopamine neuron loss in the substantia nigra, it is difficult to conclude that it is specifically the «-syn overexpression causing the damage. By optimizing the volumes, particle number and injection needle parameters to be similar as described in, for example, [75], there is no reason why the number of successfully lesioned rats with AAV-«-syn could not be increased. However, proper controls need to be used for comparison and it is clear that caution should be applied when setting up the model.
