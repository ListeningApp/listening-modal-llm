You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ap6l | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS Catalyzing Insight, Innovation, and Action
iest | W hen was the last time you sat through a meeting and said to yourself, "This is a complete waste of time!"? Was it yesterday, or even just a few hours ago? Why did that gathering feel so tedious? Perhaps it's because the leaders posed the wrong questions at the start of the session. Or, worse yet, maybe they didn't ask any engaging questions, and as a result, the meeting consisted of boring reports-outs or other forms of one- way communication that failed to engage people's interest or curiosity.
cox8 | The usefulness of the knowledge we acquire and the effectiveness of the actions we take depend on the quality of the questions we ask. Questions open the door to dialogue and discov- ery. They are an invitation to creativity and breakthrough thinking. Questions can lead to movement and action on key issues; by generating creative insights, they can ignite change.
ppqi | Consider the possibility that every- thing we know today about our world emerged because people were curious. They formulat- ed a question or series of questions about something that sparked their interest or deeply concerned them, which lead them to learn something new. Many Nobel laureates describe the "Eureka!" moment of their dis- covery as when the "right" question finally revealed itself-even if it took them considerable time to come up with the final answers. For example, Einstein's the- ory of relativity resulted from a question that he had wondered about when still a teenager: "What would the universe look like if I were riding on the end of a light beam at the speed of light?" Einstein regularly practiced this kind of "thought experiment," which,
oxou | over time, led to significant advances in the field of physics. Many years later, an empirical demonstration showed that light from distant stars actually curved as it passed through the gravitational force of our sun. Einstein's graduate students rushed to him as he was walking through the Princeton campus and exclaimed, "Dr. Einstein, light really does bend!" Einstein looked at them quizzically and said, "Of course!" He had come to this conclusion through exploring the question in his own thought experi- ment years before.
495n | Another Nobel-prize winner, physicist Arno Penzias, when asked what accounted for his success, replied, "I went for the jugular question." Still practic- ing his questioning discipline today, Penzias recently commented at a Fast Company Conference, "Change starts with the individual. So the first thing I do each morning is ask myself, 'Why do I strongly believe what I believe?' Constantly examine your own assump- tions." It's this type of self-questioning that keeps creativity alive.
awri | In other key examples of the impor- tance of powerful questions, a query by James Watson and Francis Crick, "What might DNA look like in a 3D form?" led to the discovery of the double helix and for- ever altered the scientific landscape. During the Tylenol crisis in the early 1980s, considering the question, "What is the most ethical action we might take?" enabled Johnson & Johnson to restore consumer trust and become a leader in corporate responsibility. And asking, "Where can I get a good hamburger on the road?" motivated Ray Kroc to create McDonald's, the fast-food chain that became an international icon. Even for ordinary folks, asking a question as simple as, "What does all this mean?" or "What can we do that could help shift this situation?" or "What haven't we thought of that could make a difference?" can have a startling impact on creating new knowledge and insight.
bl28 | Why Don't We Ask Better Questions?
d5bz | If asking good questions is so critical, why don't most of us spend more of our time and energy on discover- ing and framing them? One reason may be that much of Western culture, and North American society in par- ticular, focuses on having the "right answer" rather than discovering the "right question." Our educational system focuses more on memorization and rote answers than on the art of seeking new possibilities. We are rarely asked to discover compelling questions, nor are we taught why we should ask such questions in the first place. Quizzes, examinations, and aptitude tests all reinforce the value of correct answers. Is it any wonder that most of us are uncomfortable with not knowing?
ap5o | The aversion in our culture to asking creative questions is linked to an emphasis on finding quick fixes and an attachment to black/white, either/or thinking. In addition, the rapid pace of our lives and work doesn't often provide us with opportunities to participate in reflective conversations in which we can explore catalytic questions and innovative possi- bilities before reaching key decisions. These factors, coupled with a prevailing belief that "real work" con- sists primarily of detailed analysis, immediate deci- sions, and decisive action, contradict the perspective that effective "knowledge work" consists of asking profound questions and hosting wide-ranging strate- gic conversations on issues of substance.
7zvf | The reward systems in our organizations further reinforce this dilemma. Leaders believe that they are being paid for fixing problems rather than for foster- ing breakthrough thinking. Between our deep attach- ment to the answer-any answer-and our anxiety about not knowing, we have inadvertently thwarted our collective capacity for deep creativity and fresh perspectives. Unfortunately, given the unprecedented challenges we face both in our own organizations and
mov9 | as a global community, we need these skills now more than ever.
ks7m | Are there organizations that do place a high value on questions? Consider this: In Germany, the job title Direktor Grundsatzfragen translates as "Director of Fundamental Questions." As a German colleague said: "Yes, there's a job title of Direktor Grundsatz- fragen. Some of the larger German companies have an entire department of Grundsatz- fragen. These are the people who are always thinking about what the next questions will be. Of course, these people are only in the German companies headquartered in Germany, such as Daimler, Bayer, Siemens, or SAP. If the German company is acquired by a U.S. compa- ny, they usually eliminate the Grundsatzfragen positions."
w1w1 | The German understanding and appreciation of Grundsatzfragen may stem from a culture that high- ly values philosophy and the ongoing questioning of priorities and the meaning of life. Even today, this focus is reflected in some unique aspects of high- school education. In the German Gymnasium, from the ages of 14 to 17, students are typically assigned to study groups with 30 of their peers. In the words of one graduate, "We work intensely together in every subject, and then in the second year, we meet Goethe (the famous 19th-century German philosopher), and we question our entire world for two years. We emerge with a greater appreciation for the power of questions and the power of conversation."
h8gv | As we enter an era in which systemic issues often lie at the root of critical challenges, in which diverse perspectives are required for sustainable solutions, and in which cause-and-effect relationships are not immediately apparent, the capacity to raise penetrat- ing questions that challenge current operating
kwkp | assumptions will be key to creating positive futures. As Einstein said, "The problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking that created them." And in her book The Art of the Question, Marilee Goldberg adds, "A paradigm shift occurs when a question is asked inside the current paradigm that can only be answered from outside it." It's this kind of paradigm shift, based on powerful questions, that may be necessary to create truly innovative solutions to our most pressing concerns.
