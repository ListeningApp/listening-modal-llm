You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ousl | two practitioners will likely use such alternative meas- urements - such as SizeUK - while attempting to rep- licate FFIT. Sokolowski and Bettencourt (2020) even modifies FFIT to address the underlying assumptions about measurement placement that cannot work on women over size 14. However, these placement assumptions are invisible to third-party practitioners who do not run studies 'hacking' the algorithm. If using alternative measurements reclassifies bodies into different shapes, then FFIT is unauthoritative out- side of its original application because of unreplicable measurement definitions. In such a situation, ergono- mists who attempt to use the FFIT system in their work may not, therefore, be able to compare their work to others - but they are unaware of these underlying issues.
m4ju | We aim to assess the FFIT's suitability as a body classification system for scientific research and gar- ment construction purposes, considering how slight changes in measurement definitions may affect shape classifications. We use FFIT as the case by which to explore how body shape systems may provide unreli- able when used more broadly than specified systems and measurements extractions. In pursuing this aim, we consider the following hypotheses:
a0mb | 1. Calculating the FFIT using alternative measure- ment definitions causes the same human shape to be categorised as alternative body shapes, with a low - below 50% - agreement between measure- ment definition groups.
ki8m | 2. Waist measurements decrease by a statistically significant amount - x = 0.05 - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB + 4.0 cm compared to the FFIT's region of SoB + 6.35 cm: with a large effect size.
km8w | 3. Waist heights increase by a statistically significant amount - xx = 0.05 - when taken at SizeUK's region of SoB + 6.35 cm compared to the FFIT's region of SoB + 4.0 cm: with a large effect size.
wzno | 4. A person's FFIT Body Shape classification can be predicted from shoulder measurements that the FFIT excludes - Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper), and Shoulder Girth (Full) - through a statistically significant regression model; x = . 05.
xagm | In investigating our hypotheses, we analyse 1,679 UK females' FFIT shape classification - and necessary measurements - through Kappa Measure of Agreement, T-test, Multinomial Logistic Regression, and ANOVA statistical tests.
iwn5 | Materials and methods
uooz | Study population
pxbq | 1,679 females participated in this study, obtained through convenience sampling. We achieved this by posting flyers and adverts on social media (Facebook and Twitter), inviting members of the public to attend open scanning sessions between 2011 to 2016 in Manchester <LATEX>\left( n = 9 0 0 \right) ,</LATEX> Nottingham <LATEX>\left( n = 2 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and London
jfsr | <LATEX>\left( n = 5 7 8 \right) .</LATEX> Our sampling frame required participants to be female, over 18 years old, have no physical or cogni- tive disabilities, and not be pregnant during data cap- ture. These measures ensure ethical compliance and reduce the sample's independent variables. We only sampled females because the FFIT body shape classifi- cation system relates explicitly to the female body. We gained participant consent before data collection, with full prior approval of the study by Manchester Metropolitan University's ethics committee. Personal identifiable data was collected, kept separately, and de-identified within the working data set.
u15r | Sample size
lq35 | To achieve a power of <LATEX>\pi \geq 0 . 8 ,</LATEX> we calculated the min- imum sample size as 1,448 participants using <LATEX>\mathrm { G } ^ { * } \mathrm { P o w e }</LATEX> (Faul et al. 2020). We calculated our sample size for a one-way between-groups ANOVA with a small sample size. We used these parameters because an ANOVA has the greatest sample requirements of all our study's tests; Effect Size
3g9w | <LATEX>f = 0 . 1 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 0 5</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( 1 - \beta \right) = 0 . 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>G r p s = 8 .</LATEX> We sampled 1,679 participants, exceeding our minimum sample size by 231 participants.
d09o | Sample demographics

S D = 1 4 . 5 \right)</LATEX> of body mass 34.0-160.3 kg <LATEX>\left( M = 6 5 . 3 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. S D = 1 5 . 0 \right) ,</LATEX> and height <LATEX>1 3 3 . 5 - 1 8 8 . 9 \quad c m</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( M = 1 5 4 . 6 , S D = 6 . 6 \right) .</LATEX> Participant ethnicity was mainly White <LATEX>\left( n = 1 3 1 5 \right) ,</LATEX> but also included Black <LATEX>\left( n = \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. 1 5 4 \right) ,</LATEX> Asian <LATEX>\left( n = 6 0 \right) ,</LATEX> Chinese <LATEX>\left( n = 4 4 \right) ,</LATEX> Mixed White and Black <LATEX>\left( n = 3 0 \right) ,</LATEX> Other Mixed Background <LATEX>\left( n = \right.</LATEX> 28), Mixed White and Asian <LATEX>\left( n = 1 2 \right) ,</LATEX> and other/not stated <LATEX>\left( n = 2 1 \right) .</LATEX> All participants were UK females.
a3td | Data collection procedure
ex5k | Before participants attended scan sessions, they were provided with guidelines regarding the body scanning requirements concerning underwear, jewellery, and hair. All participants were asked to use non-padded
9d4o | and non-compression underwear to avoid any distor- tion of their natural body shape. The research ethics prohibits scanning anybody without underwear and excludes any inspection because of privacy issues. To ensure underwear, jewellery, or hair did not distort body shapes, the research team visually inspected each subjects' collected (processed) scan data. Visual inspection ensured all landmark points and measure- ments were in locations according to the anatomy and surface, considering measurement standards for clothing. Scan data that provided inaccurate measure- ments of the participant was removed.
cjq2 | We used TC2's KX-16 body-scanner to collect partici- pant's body scan data, with all participants adopting the standard scanning posture as different standing postures significantly alters waist and hip placement (Gill and Parker 2017). The standard scanning posture is 'standing position <LATEX>\mathrm { A } ^ { \prime }</LATEX> according to ISO 20685 (ISO 2010a); see Figure 3 that aligns with Gill, Hayes, and Parker's (2016) scanning protocol. We used the anonymised body scan data for measurement extraction and analysis.
5esx | Table 1 displays the definitions of anthropometric measurements and parameters used in this paper. The TC2 software (TC2 2015) also uses these definitions to determine measurement placement on the body.
m5ka | The Small of Back (SoB) is vital in developing the TC2 software's Measurement Extraction Protocol (SizeUK 2002), as the software cannot locate the waist without some points of reference (TC2 2015). The SoB is defined as the deepest point of the spinal curve at the tangential change, closer to the buttocks (Kirchdoerfer et al. 2002), differing from traditional manual landmarking. The SoB represents the starting point for waist measurements and is key to how shape would be defined and, therefore, should be fully understood. Plus numbers (e.g. +6.35 cm) give the distance above the SoB; defining the upper limit for the region within which a scanner can find the smallest waist circumference. SizeUK allow an upper limit <LATEX>o f + 4 \quad c m</LATEX> and the FFIT +6.35 cm from the SoB; see Table 1.
byu8 | Equipment suitability
76b0 | The TC2 body scanner's suitability, reliability, and validity within clothing science research has been demonstrated by multiple authors (Pandarum, Yu, and Hunter 2011; Gropper et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2015; Gill and Parker 2017). Notably, the TC2 scanner provides a greater depth and volume of data than traditional methods (Loker, Ashdown, and Schoenfelder 2005; Gill 2015). As Bye, LaBat, and Delong (2006) prove, body scanning captures
zxz6 | points, lengths, surface, shape, and volume, while tape measures - for example - only capture length.
xnth | Out of FFIT's nine body shapes, we used Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) algorithm for FFIT's seven body shapes in our automatic shape sorting programme; see Table 2. We categorised participants into body shape using Visual Basic (Microsoft 1998); see Appendix's Table A1 and Box 1. We selected Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) algorithm as it is the same algorithm Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a; 2004b) used in FFIT's development. We accept that our excluded shapes (diamond and oval) would be categorised into 'other' shapes because of limitations in defining the abdomen and stomach - as Yim Lee et al. (2007) accepted. Yim Lee et al. (2007) even considered another category - 'Shape not known' - to filter unclas- sified shapes from the extracted measurements, as we use in Table 2; see Box 1 in Appendix Table A1.

d6r4 | To investigate alternative body measurement defini- tions' influence on the FFIT's body shape classification, we considered three sets of measurement definitions: DS1, DS2, and DS3.
9mrz | Definition Set 1 (DS1) includes the bust, waist, hip, and high hip measurements, the same as the FFIT measurement definitions (Yim Lee et al. 2007; Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004a; Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004b).
pk06 | Definition Set 2 (DS2) includes the bust, waist, and high hip measurements, the same as the FFIT defini- tions. The FFIT's Hip measurement definition is, how- ever, replaced with the SizeUK Hip measurement definition with TC2's (2011) Seat Girth measurement, presented in Table 1. For DS2, only the hip's definition is different. We maintain the other three measure- ments to see how changing only one measurement definition in four alters the body shape classification.
7wn9 | Definition Set 3 (DS3) includes the bust, waist, high- hip, and seat (in place of the hip) girth measurements, the same as the SizeUK measurement definition (TC2 2015), presented in Table 1. The bust measurement and its parameter settings in the TC2 Measurement Extraction Protocol (TC2 2015) are the same for the FFIT and SizeUK; see Table 1. For DS3, all measurement definitions are as per the SizeUK sizing survey.
wcd0 | Waist measurement parameters' selection
caos | This study's two waist measurement parameters are: SizeUK's SoB + 4.0 cm region (TC2 2015) and the FFIT'S SoB + 6.35 cm region (Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan 2004a, 2004b; Devarajan and Istook 2004).
qrvy | Shoulder measurements' parameters' selection
pn9j | The three shoulder measurement parameters we used to represent shoulder anthropometrics were: shoulder- to-shoulder (horizontal), shoulder-to-shoulder (calliper), and shoulder girth (TC2 2015). We selected these three parameters to capture the shoulder's shape,
1pmc | allowing shoulders to relate to the other shape classifi- cation measurements.
5z6q | While higher complexities of shoulder anthropomet- rics - such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth - may associate with FFIT body shape, we focussed on key measurements traditionally used in gar- ment construction. Using traditional measurements retains consistency with the FFIT's measurements and current practice. It was essential to select measurements that - like the other FFIT dimensions - could define the shape and provide a context within current pattern cut- ting practices.
yeoh | Data handling
b8hf | Manchester Metropolitan University held the study's data within a database of UK scan data following the Data Protection Act (Great Britain 1998). A practitioner - with 15 years' experience - extracted participant data from the database before inspecting all scans to ensure the data's reliability and validity. Before con- ducting statistical analysis - i.e. Multinomial Logistic Regression, t-tests, or ANOVA -, we followed Tabachnick and Fidell's (2007a) procedures to check for violation of Normality, Linearity, and Homoscedasticity assumptions. We found no serious violations, allowing us to proceed with data analysis.
hntf | Statistical analysis
99fo | We undertook all statistical analysis with SPSS (IBM 2017), with initial screening in Excel (Microsoft 2019). Significance for all tests was determined at the <LATEX>p \leq 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level. We interpret effect sizes and power requirements in line with Cohen's (1988) widely accepted benchmarks.
y5r7 | Alternative measurement definitions
lrry | We used Kappa Measure of Agreements to gauge the level of agreement between the FFIT categorical classi- fications under DS1, DS2, and DS3 measurement defi- nitions, investigating hypothesis 1. High agreement indicates high stability in the classification. Table 2 shows how many participants fit each of the FFIT's body shapes, according to differential measurement definitions. We selected the hourglass body as the ref- erence shape because it was the most common in DS1: FFIT's 'standard' interpretation.
hvhm | Alternative waist definition's measurement impact We used T-Tests to investigate the differences between alternative waist measurement definitions. T-
