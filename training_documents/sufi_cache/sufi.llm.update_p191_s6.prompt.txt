You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

rzna | To analyse these special tales deprives them of their instrumental value: just as taking a hammer to pieces would mean that it would cease to be a hammer. The tales have been used from immemorial antiquity as the bearers of knowledge and the instru- ments of understanding. But they have to be experienced aright Here is one of the few which help in this experience, and no more can be said about the matter:
2zyk | THE JOURNEY
950a | A man was on a journey with a Sufi teacher when night fell, and both were tired and hungry. The master asked at a humble house for food and the tenant, a poor man, gave them everything he had.
6sy6 | In the morning, the Sufi said: 'Blessings upon you and your house,' and the two travellers started on their way.
tcjn | After they had gone a few steps, the disciple said:
zfgu | 'We have surely not recompensed this man for his generosity. Could you not give him more than a mere blessing?'
3sg2 | 'He has had enough. More would not be better' said the master.
nwsl | But the soft-hearted disciple hung his head and with as much politeness as he could exercise, he insisted that 'all are bound to do all they can for others ... '
kzow | 'Very well,' said the Sufi, 'I shall let you see what happens.'
j691 | He went back and called their host, saying to him:
skj8 | 'A treasure is buried in your garden. It is under that apple tree. Dig it up and flourish.'
7y4m | The two set off again, and they wandered for a year. It so happened that they were passing the same way again, hungry and tired, when they saw that the house was no longer there. It had been replaced by a palace. The formerly kindly tenant was now a great lord, and everyone around was suffering from his tyranny.
ur08 | 'What do you say now?' asked the teacher.
sv2t | 'I understand what has happened,' said his disciple. 'But if you knew that this would happen, why did you do as I asked: in fact causing this man to become an oppressor?"
n10e | The master waved his hand; and the disciple saw that they were back in the conditions of a year before. No trace of the tyrant remained: they were looking at the smiling face of the humble cottager, waving them goodbye. It was at that moment that the disciple realised that the Sufi teacher had vanished. He has not found him since; and that was many years ago.
p009 | Attacking Fires
b0gb | Q: In an article in a literary journal, someone has said that you get on a hobby-horse, attacking scholars. Is this true, and if not true, what are you doing?
k06q | A: It is not only what I am doing which interests you, but what others (people in one or two literary journals) are doing. I am not an expert on them; but after someone tried to demolish me on one occasion, a well-known scholar who suffers a lot from this kind of circus sent me this, 'The Non-entity's Prayer' :-
ac74 | O Lord, make me successful enough to be attacked! But if I cannot have this, let me remain unsuccessful enough to retain the delights of attacking others !
sh6j | If you see a fireman rushing to put out a blaze, and you shout, 'Look at that man on his hobby-horse again, attacking fires!', this luckily neither stops him nor prevents other people from realising that there may be something wrong with you instead. You should also note, if you will, that in the scholarly world itself, my activi- ties seem to be well known and well understood. You should not only look at the person who is being attacked-you should look also at the attacker and form your own opinions as best you can. Although it has taken a decade and a half, there is no lack of both advanced and respected scholars to understand and support our traditional and well-tried 'attack' method as salutary and justified. Can you say the same for the few whom you are quoting?
u02a | I have criticised unworthy and shallow scholars only. That certain academics seem to think that I mean them personally is to be interpreted by a psychologist, not by me.
ukvr | If you look at the thing in isolation, of course you will get a distorted picture. Scholars delight in attacking one another; and the surest way of becoming established in certain fields is to get attacked as 'no scholar*, which is a jargon word used by scholars
b91y | about each other.
7vg8 | The real scholars have a sense of humour which the shallow ones haven't. I'll never forget the occasion when a prominent literary figure was introduced to a meeting with the words, 'I have pleasure in presenting Dr. Bloggs, who has been assailed in almost every serious periodical in his field for nearly twenty years!'
bbxl | There was thunderous applause.
tloz | Rumi often points out, as do many other Sufi writers, that being an expert is not necessarily the best way to profit from something.
w7mp | THE STRONG MAN IN PAIN
86e2 | In a story related by Saadi (The Orchard: On Acceptance) a doctor visited a strong man who was writhing in pain. His opinion was that since the man had been eating vine-leaves, it would be surprising if he lasted the night. But, continues Saadi, it was the physician who died that very night. That was forty years before - and the athlete still lived!
2jz9 | Scholars and specialists have the problem that subjectivity can affect their thinking. Like the doctor, they may themselves suffer through their lack of knowledge: for it seems unlikely that the physician suspected that his own death was so near-in spite of being so confident about the death of another.
h18h | The Prophet Mohammed is reported to have said that the ink of the scholar is holier than the blood of the martyr. In spite of this, Sufis have for many centuries not shrunk from assailing shallow scholars and those who are really pseudo-scholars, wherever they are to be found. If to do this is to be on a hobby-horse, I am honoured to be counted as one who follows so noble an ex- ample.
s9sw | But, in any case, you are a little out of date. The battle has raged away from where I sit. Some scholars attacked me, then others defended me. The first lot called the second shallow, and now they are fighting it out among themselves. I have no part in this controversy, since it is between third parties.
yp2h | A Bridge and its Use
e0to | IT will seem improbable, yet it is no exaggeration to say that people ignore, are unaware of or even sneer at materials which could be their only hope of escaping from circular thinking.
opm8 | I have learned more from people, things and ideas which are by many considered irrelevant, slight or even worthless, than from much more advertised and crudely emphasized materials.
tzkf | People who cannot or will not approach these sources of know- ledge may accept them when they have been put in a manner which they are prepared to accept. This indicates the serious limitation on learning imposed by so many people's refusal to look at anything which seems to them to be unsuitable, judged from its outward face.
o0zw | But this is only the first part of a process. You can 'popularise' or make palatable, but at some point you must direct attention to the original thing.
i0bj | If we have to act as a bridge, we must fulfil the function of a bridge, which is to conduct from one side of something to another side.
kcxv | DIMENSIONS OF A FOOT
l57i | I remember the case of one person who was able to understand this, and hence to become sensitive to the existence and operation of a Sufi school imperceptible to others, by simply digesting the statement of Rumi, in Fihi ma Fihi:
t6hd | 'I am a shoemaker, with much leather. But I do the cutting and the stitching according to the dimensions of the foot'
