You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8oqt | Supervised learning involves fitting a model with labelled training data and then use it for prediction. It can be classed either as a regression (predicted variable is numeric) or classification (predicted variable is categorical) problems (Jiang et al., 2020). The three steps in supervised learning are: (1) fitting a model from the sample input observations (2) evaluating the model and then extensively tuning the hyper-parameters of the model (3) setting up the model for the production stage and using it for prediction (Foster et al., 2014).

ha9e | Identify Unsupervised learning is used to find the underlying patterns in unlabelled data using input feature variables without the target/output clusters variable (Badillo et al., 2020). It can be used for clustering (Xu and Tian, 2015), anomaly detection (Thudumu et al., 2020) and dimensionality reduction (Xu et al., 2019a).
xrnt | This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a short back- ground related to multi-omics and ML. Section 3 describes how ML is employed for multi-omics analysis and what are the various real-world challenges of it. In Section 4, details of different multi-omics integration approaches are presented. Section 5, published multi-omics studies using ML methods are discussed. Section 6 describes a recommendation flowchart for choosing an appropriate method for multi-omics integra- tion. Conclusions are provided in Section 7.
c8ra | 2. Background
p1l0 | 2.1. Multi-omics
1i8b | In living beings, genetic information in the cells flows from DNA (deoxyribo-nucleic acid) to the mRNA (messenger ribo-nucleic acid) to protein and is dictated by the central dogma of molecular biology (Lodish et al., 2000). This flow of information is often considered analogous to a computer system which has facilitated the understanding of biological information processing (Wang and Gribskov, 2005; D'Onofrio and An, 2010).
5sfj | The study of DNA, mRNA and proteins is broadly denoted as geno- mics, transcriptomics, and proteomics respectively. The genetic blue- print of a cell is explored using genomics, which looks at the DNA of individuals and helps us to investigate the presence or absence of certain genes (Gibson, 2015; Vogel and Motulsky, 1997). Transcriptomics studies the transcribed genetic material and examines the genes which
vk4h | are actively expressed and provides information about what is happening at the cellular level (Milward et al., 2016). Proteomics helps in characterising the information flow happening within the cell and the organism in the form of protein pathways and their networks (Wu et al., 2014).
nsm3 | Although metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics do not form part of the central dogma analysis (Cobb, 2017), they still provide an invaluable amount of information regarding the metabolites, lipids and glycans (synthesised by the proteome via biosynthetic pathways) (Barh et al., 2011). These substances are the intermediate products of a cell's information flow and therefore are considered to be excellent indicators of the cell's activity. Similar to single-genome studies, metagenomics is used to sequence genetic information from environmental samples without the requirement of isolating individual species (Hugenholtz and Tyson, 2008).
