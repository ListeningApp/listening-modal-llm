You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | Further Evidence for Mixed Emotions
1wj6 | Emotion theorists have long debated whether valence, which ranges from pleasant to unpleasant states, is an irreducible aspect of the experience of emotion or whether positivity and negativity are separable in experience. If valence is irreducible, it follows that people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time. Conversely, if positivity and negativity are separable, people may be able to experience such mixed emotions. The authors tested several alternative interpretations for prior evidence that happiness and sadness can co-occur in bittersweet situations (i.e., those containing both pleasant and unpleasant aspects). One possibility is that subjects who reported mixed emotions merely vacillated between happiness and sadness. The authors tested this hypothesis in Studies 1-3 by asking subjects to complete online continuous measures of happiness and sadness. Subjects reported more simultaneously mixed emotions during a bittersweet film clip than during a control clip. Another possibility is that subjects in earlier studies reported mixed emotions only because they were explicitly asked whether they felt happy and sad. The authors tested this hypothesis in Studies 4-6 with open-ended measures of emotion. Subjects were more likely to report mixed emotions after the bittersweet clip than the control clip. Both patterns occurred even when subjects were told that they were not expected to report mixed emotions (Studies 2 and 5) and among subjects who did not previously believe that people could simultaneously feel happy and sad (Studies 3 and 6). These results provide further evidence that positivity and negativity are separable in experience.

dpv6 | Can people feel happy and sad at the same time? If the experience of valence is analogous to the experience of temperature, the answer is no. Imagine a room heated by a heater running at maximum capacity and cooled by an air conditioner running at half capacity (Green, Salovey, & Truax, 1999). If the air flowing from the heater and air conditioner have ample opportunity to mix together, how would the room's occupants feel? Would they feel extremely warm and moderately cold? No. Just as if the heater was running at half capacity and the air conditioner was off, they would feel moderately warm and not at all cold (see Schimmack, 2001). This is because the experience of temperature is irreducible. In other words, the experi- ences of warm and cold are inseparable such that feelings of warmth preclude feelings of cold and vice versa. A long line of scholars have argued that positivity and negativity are also inseparable in experience

2taz | and that emotional valence is irreducible (Bain, 1859; Barrett, 2006; Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009; Russell & Carroll, 1999; Titchener, 1908; Wundt, 1896). Bain (1859), for instance, conceptualized plea- sure and displeasure as being so antagonistic that "the presence of the one destroys the property of the other, as an acid neutralizes an alkali [i.e., base]" (p. 441), and Barrett (2006) has conceptualized valence as a "basic building block" of emotional experience (p. 36). By such accounts, people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time (Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009; Russell & Carroll, 1999), even if the events affecting their emotional state have both pleasant and unpleasant aspects (Russell, 2003). On the other hand, Socrates argued in Plato's Philebus that the experience of positivity is separable from that of negativity. Hume (1739/2000), Ebbinghaus (1902; cited in Wohlge- muth, 1919), and Cacioppo and Berntson (1994) have taken similar positions. This line of thinking raises the possibility that people can feel mixed emotions of happiness and sadness at the same time.
o3ya | To the extent that mixed emotions can occur, they may have meaningful consequences. Evidence indicates that individuals with schizophrenia may experience mixed emotions when recalling pleasant memories (Cohen, St-Hilaire, Aakre, & Docherty, 2009), that mixed emotions may foster healthy coping with stressors (Coifman, Bonanno, & Rafaeli, 2007), and that the extent to which advertisements elicit mixed emotions may influence their effec- tiveness (Williams & Aaker, 2002). As explained below, however, answering the basic question of whether people can feel happy and

tzt3 | sad at the same time requires more sophisticated measures of emotion than those employed in these and other studies, including our own (e.g., J. T. Larsen, McGraw, & Cacioppo, 2001). As a result, it remains unclear whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Our goal is to take steps toward answering that question and the larger question of whether valence is irreducible in experience.
t8vv | Contemporary Theoretical Perspectives
qvnu | A common contemporary approach to identifying the number and nature of the dimensions underlying emotional experience is to ask people to rate the extent to which they currently feel a variety of discrete emotions (e.g., happy, excited, stressed, sad). Factor analyses of the resulting correlation matrices generally reveal a two-factor solution with each emotion falling along the perimeter of a circumplex structure. Most notably, happiness and sadness consistently emerge as polar opposites separated by nearly 180° (for a meta-analysis, see Remington, Fabrigar, & Visser, 2000). What, then, is the relationship between happiness and sadness in experience?
kggw | Even though Watson and Tellegen's (1985) positive activation- negative activation (PA-NA) model contends that highly arousing positive emotions (e.g., excited) and negative emotions (e.g., dis- tressed) are fairly independent, it recognizes that happiness and sadness lie at opposite ends of a bipolar valence dimension (e.g., Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999; see Figure 1). The
xrd1 | Figure 1. Watson and Tellegen's (1985; Watson et al., 1999) positive activation-negative activation (PA-NA) model and Russell's (1980; Russell & Barrett, 1999; Russell & Carroll, 1999) valence-arousal model. Arrows indicate the pair of dimensions highlighted by the respective models. These depictions are intended to highlight the models' similarities, particularly their conceptualization of happiness and sadness as falling at opposite ends of a bipolar valence dimension. Adapted from "Toward a Consensual Structure of Mood," by D. Watson and A. Tellegen, 1985, Psychological Bulletin, 98, p. 221, and "The Structure of Current Affect: Controversies and Emerging Consensus," by L. F. Barrett and J. A. Russell, 1999, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 8, p. 11. Copyright 1985 by the American Psychological Association and 1999 by the Association for Psycholog- ical Science, respectively.
5746 | PA-NA model further contends that polar opposites (e.g., happi- ness and sadness) should be perfectly negatively correlated. By this account, any increase in happiness comes with a commensu- rate decrease in sadness, and vice versa (see Figure 2A).
7toz | Russell's (1980; Russell & Barrett, 1999; Russell & Carroll, 1999) valence-arousal model highlights a bipolar valence dimen- sion ranging from positive emotions (e.g., happiness) to negative emotions (e.g., sadness) and an orthogonal arousal dimension ranging from emotions low in arousal (e.g., calm) to those high in arousal (e.g., tense; see Figure 1). As explained by Watson et al. (1999) and Russell and Barrett (1999) and illustrated in Figure 1, the PA-NA and valence-arousal models are virtually identical even though they highlight different pairs of dimensions. Perhaps the most prominent difference between the models is that they make different predictions about the relationship between polar opposite emotions. Whereas the PA-NA model contends that polar opposites are perfectly negatively correlated, the valence-arousal model's bipolarity hypothesis (Barrett & Russell, 2003) echoes Bain (1859), Wundt (1896), and Titchener (1908) by contending that happiness and sadness, like feelings of hot and cold (Schim- mack, 2001), are mutually exclusive. As Russell and Carroll (1999) put it, "Bipolarity says that when you are happy, you are not sad and that when you are sad, you are not happy" (p. 25; see Figure 2B).
j346 | At first glance, the PA-NA model's contention that happiness and sadness are perfectly negatively correlated seems reasonable.

Gray and white areas represent configurations of happiness and sadness that theoretically can and cannot occur.

(B) Predictions of Russell and Carroll's (1999) valence-arousal model, which contends that happiness and sadness are mutually exclusive. (C) Predictions of the evaluative space model (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994), which allows any configuration of happiness and sadness.
4i0e | One plausible implication is that people cannot feel extremely happy and extremely sad at the same time. At least three other implications seem much less plausible. As illustrated in Figure 2A, to claim that happiness and sadness are perfectly negatively cor- related is to predict that all but the most intense levels of happiness are accompanied by some amount of sadness, that all but the most intense levels of sadness are accompanied by some amount of happiness, and that people cannot feel neutral (i.e., neither happy nor sad). In addition to being implausible, these predictions are inconsistent with the findings of Carroll and Russell (1998; cited in Russell & Carroll, 1999), who asked people in classroom settings to rate their happiness and sadness. Few subjects fell anywhere near the diagonal representing a perfect negative correlation. Most reported varying degrees of happiness, some reported varying degrees of sadness, but only 11% reported feeling both happy and sad. With allowance for measurement error, these data are consis- tent with the valence-arousal model's contention that happiness and sadness are mutually exclusive.
h2l3 | Though they disagree about whether emotions at opposite ends of the bipolar valence dimension (e.g., happiness and sadness) are perfectly negatively correlated or mutually exclusive, both the PA-NA and valence-arousal models agree that the bipolar valence dimension is irreducible. In contrast, Cacioppo and Berntson's (1994) evaluative space model (ESM) conceptualizes the positive and negative substrates underlying the bipolar valence dimension as separable. Drawing on a variety of findings including evidence that people can have both positive and negative reactions toward attitude objects, the ESM contends that affective reactions can be characterized by any pattern of positivity and negativity. This conceptualization can be extended to the experience of emotion, including such polar opposite emotions as happiness and sadness (Cacioppo, Larsen, Smith, & Berntson, 2004; J. T. Larsen et al. 2001). Whereas the PA-NA and valence-arousal models contend that happiness and sadness are perfectly negatively correlated and mutually exclusive, respectively, the ESM allows for the possibil- ity that people can experience any pattern of happiness and sadness (see Figure 2C). Because ambivalent states provide poor behav- ioral guidance (Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994), the ESM does not contend that polar opposite emotions always or even usually

u6ty | co-occur. Rather, polar opposite emotions should be most likely to co-occur in bittersweet situations, which we conceptualize as those containing both pleasant and unpleasant aspects (J. T. Larsen et al., 2001).
awvu | Initial Evidence for Mixed Emotions
on9b | Some evidence indicates that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Stanley and Meyer (2009) asked subjects to report their emotions after they had watched each of 24 evocative film clips. Parallel factor analyses revealed a two-factor solution with valence and arousal dimensions. Additional analyses revealed a three-factor solution in which the valence dimension split into two positivity and negativity factors anchored by happy and sad. Pos- itivity and negativity were only modestly negatively correlated, which suggests that some of the films may have made some subjects feel mixed emotions of happiness and sadness.
a8ge | Factor analyses are based on correlation matrices, but negative correlation coefficients shed little light on the co-occurrence of two emotions (Russell & Carroll, 1999; Schimmack, 2001). A more direct approach to assessing the co-occurrence of happiness and sadness is to count how many people report feeling both (Russell & Carroll, 1999; see also Diener & Iran-Nejad, 1986). Many early psychologists took this approach, and some found evidence for mixed emotions, but as Beebe-Center (1932) and Schimmack and Colcombe (1999) pointed out, methodological limitations prevent any firm conclusions. In a more rigorous study, J. T. Larsen et al. (2001) asked moviegoers whether they felt happy, sad, and other pairs of polar opposite emotions (e.g., calm vs. tense) just before or just after they had watched Life Is Beau- tiful (Benigni, 1997), a tragicomedy set in a World War II con- centration camp. Consistent with the valence-arousal model, all pairs of polar opposite emotions rarely co-occurred before the film. Notably, only 10% of subjects reported feeling both happy and sad. Also consistent with the valence-arousal model, most pairs of polar opposite emotions rarely co-occurred after the film. There was but one exception: Forty-four percent of these subjects re- ported mixed emotions of happiness and sadness. Other studies indicate that meaningful life transitions (e.g., college graduation;
