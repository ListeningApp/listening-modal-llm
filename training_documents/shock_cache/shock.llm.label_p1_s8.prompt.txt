You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1wj6 | State of Shock: Contemporary Vasopressor and Inotrope Use in Cardiogenic Shock
936l | ABSTRACT: Cardiogenic shock is characterized by tissue hypoxia caused by circulatory failure arising from inadequate cardiac output. In addition to treating the pathologic process causing impaired cardiac function, prompt hemodynamic support is essential to reduce the risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction and to preserve cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic therapy with the use of vasopressors and inotropes is a key component of this treatment strategy, improving perfusion by increasing cardiac output, altering systemic vascular resistance, or both, while allowing time and hemodynamic stability to treat the un- derlying disease process implicated in the development of cardiogenic shock. Despite the use of mechanical circulatory sup- port recently garnering significant interest, pharmacologic hemodynamic support remains a cornerstone of cardiogenic shock management, with over 90% of patients receiving at least 1 vasoactive agent. This review aims to describe the pharmacology and hemodynamic effects of current pharmacotherapies and provide a practical approach to their use, while highlighting important future research directions.
06yq | C ardiogenic shock (CS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by insufficient cardiac output to meet basal metabolic requirements, leading to life-threatening end-organ hypoperfusion.1 The devel- opment of CS has downstream effects on the entire circulation, causing tissue hypoxia and injury, inflam- mation, and vasoplegia as part of a systemic inflamma- tory response syndrome in many cases. Physiologic compensatory mechanisms include endogenous sympathetic stimulation which augments cardiac output by increasing heart rate and myocardial con- tractility.2 In addition to the direct cardiac effects pro- duced by these endogenous compounds, peripheral vasoconstriction serves to increase systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure (MAP). These compensatory responses occur at the expense of mal- adaptive increases in cardiac afterload, myocardial ox- ygen requirements, and filling pressures, with resulting reductions in coronary perfusion pressure.2 Therefore,

2taz | prompt hemodynamic support is essential to restore cellular metabolism and prevent worsening systemic and myocardial ischemia, which drives the "shock spi- ral" that in many cases leads to circulatory collapse and death.1
o3ya | The initial goals of therapy for patients with CS can broadly be defined by 2 overarching principles: first, to rapidly identify and treat the underlying cause of shock (for example, urgent revascularization in acute myocar- dial infarction related cardiogenic shock [AMI-CS]) to enable cardiac recovery3; second, to improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation through obtaining a mini- mum acceptable cardiac output and blood pressure, achieved through hemodynamic support strategies that may include the use of vasoactive medications and in select cases temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS). The current review focuses on the pharmacologic hemodynamic supports that can be offered in this clinical context.

t8vv | Defining CS has traditionally been challenging, owing to the various clinical, biochemical, and hemodynamic definitions used in the seminal outcome trials and societal guidelines.5 The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions has recently sought to harmonize these definitions through a pragmatic classification system that can be applied to a range of clinical setting and helps enable the diagnosis of CS across the full clinical spectrum of disease sever- ity, ranging from "at risk" to fulminant circulatory col- lapse.6,7 Importantly, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions diagnostic and stag- ing system of CS has been validated across multiple clinical subgroups, including CS with and without AMI, patients admitted to intensive care, and those with CS complicating out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.7 The use of a uniform definition for CS and its severity will play a crucial role for future epidemiologic and clinical tri- als, allowing direct comparison between outcomes as- sociated with specific therapies, systems of care, and treatment protocols.7
qvnu | Despite the challenges with defining and diag- nosing CS, it is a common problem in clinical prac- tice with an estimated incidence of 408 per 100 000 hospitalizations based on the United States National Inpatient Sample.8 Acute coronary syndromes are the most common cause of CS, accounting for 70% of cases.9,10 The management of this cohort of patients is both costly and requires significant health care resource use. The average length of hospital stay ranges between 8.9 and 18.6 days with an associated cost of treating a patient with AMI-CS in the United States of $41 774±$45252.11,12 Despite significant im- provements over the past 2 decades in contemporary revascularization techniques and supportive care, 1- year mortality rates continue to range between 50% and 60%.13
kggw | Although the epidemiology and outcomes of in- hospital CS have been well described, there remains a paucity of data in relation to the incidence, treatment provision, and outcomes of CS in the prehospital en- vironment. A recent population-based cohort study of a large provincial emergency medical services registry demonstrated that the overall incidence of emergency medical services treated CS was 14.5 per 100000

7toz | person-years, with an overall 30-day all-cause mor- tality of 43.9%.14,15 Despite large numbers of patients with CS receiving the initial phase of their treatment by emergency medical services, prehospital therapeu- tic interventions (eg, mechanical ventilation, and va- soactive medications), in addition to many in-hospital interventions, are yet to be proven effective through high-quality observational or randomized data.16
j346 | Current Use of Vasoactive Medications in Clinical Practice
v8uq | The use of vasoactive medications in CS is common. In the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, ~25% of admit- ted patients receive at least 1 vasoactive medication, increasing to >90% in patients with CS.17,18 Although comparative studies assessing these agents are lim- ited, norepinephrine is increasingly administered for patients requiring hemodynamic support with CS.18,19 The requirement for vasoactive medications is inde- pendently associated with short-term mortality and a stepwise increase in risk of in-hospital mortality has been observed with increasing number of vasoac- tive agents administered.18,20-22 Furthermore, a dose- dependent relationship with higher required peak doses to achieve hemodynamic stability is also asso- ciated with an increased risk of death.18 Although the observed excess mortality risk associated with the use of this drug class is of concern, these findings are likely to be confounded by increased illness severity necessitating the use of multiple agents at high doses. Nonetheless, these data underscore the need for fur- ther evaluation of the utility of these commonly used medications, compared with alternate vasoactive spar- ing strategies such as MCS.
x972 | CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND PHARMACODYNAMICS OF VASOACTIVE MEDICATIONS
cwrw | The study of the physiologic properties of vasoactive medications dates back to 1893, when the English physician George Oliver assessed the effects of vari- ous glandular extracts derived from sheep on radial artery vasoreactivity in his son.23 Evolving from these early experiments, the contemporary conceptual framework for these agents was established and is broadly divided into 3 categories in accordance with their predominant hemodynamic effects: vasopres- sors, inotropes, and inodilators. Vasopressors improve perfusion to vital organs by increasing systemic vascu- lar resistance and therefore MAP.24 Inotropes augment cardiac output by increasing myocardial contractility and in many instances heart rate. Inodilators have the

awvu | Conventional descriptions of the agonist-receptor- effector interactions promulgated in traditional phar- macology teaching is primarily based on small studies from the 1950s to 1960s, using variable drug doses and indirect surrogate measurements of in-vivo recep- tor activity and downstream effects.25-27 In these early mechanistic studies, the observed physiologic effects of catecholamine administration (in healthy subjects) on blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, and heart rate were used to extrapolate specific agonist- receptor-effector biology. However, it is becoming

xmgs | This complex interaction has been assessed in pharmacodynamic studies in a sheep model where comparable doses of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinphrine, and dopamine) were administered, and their doses titrated. Of note, all 3 drugs signifi- cantly and equally increased cardiac output, MAP, and right atrial pressure in a dose-dependent fash- ion.29 Similar observations have been made in clinical studies of CS, with the inotrope epinephrine being compared with the vasopressor noradrenaline and producing similar hemodynamic effects.30,31 These findings suggest that the arbitrary vasopressor and inotrope definitions for catecholamines, in particu- lar when the term "vasopressor" is used to describe

gy8c | Myocardial Oxygen Consumption
y4mj | Although the overarching purpose of vasopressors and inotropes in CS is to improve tissue oxygen deliv- ery, these agents also increase myocardial oxygen de- mand, which in the setting of a cardiomyocyte oxygen supply-demand mismatch can cause further injury and contractile dysfunction. The energetic requirements of the myocardium is primarily met through oxidative metabolic pathways with <5% of ATP derived from gly- colytic pathways.32 Basal metabolic requirements ac- count for 10% to 20% of the total myocardial oxygen requirements, with the remaining oxygen needs deter- mined by variables that include heart rate, contractility, and systolic wall tension.32 The relative contribution of these variables has been characterized through human and animal models, primarily using exercise to induce increased cardiac work. From these studies, heart rate has been shown to be the greatest contributor to myocardial oxygen consumption. Through augmenta- tion with pacing, it was found that 30% to 40% of the heart's metabolic needs were secondary to heart rate variation.32 However, this is likely an underestimate of the true impact of heart rate, due to pacing mediated reductions in end-diastolic and stroke volumes, with some estimates of heart rate variation accounting for up to 50% to 70% of myocardial oxygen demand.32,33 The contribution of contractility has been elegantly assessed through several animal and human studies, showing that increased myocardial contractility under physiological stress (exercise) accounts for 15% to 25% of the oxygen demand.32 In addition to factors that influence myocar- dial oxygen requirements, supply is principally governed by the coronary perfusion pressure gradient, perfusion time (which occurs predominantly during diastole and is reduced with increased heart rate), and coronary ar- tery vasomotor tone. 34 Therefore, the interplay between hemodynamic supports, cardiac filling pressures, heart rate variation, and coronary vasomotor tone has the po- tential to adversely influence myocardial oxygen supply- demand mismatch in the setting of CS.

wzno | The direct cardiac effects of catecholamines are mediated through the G-protein-coupled ß,-AR, which comprise 80% of the ß-AR population within the left ventricle.36 ß .- AR stimulation augments cardiac output through increased cytosolic Ca2+ cycling and phos- phorylation of troponin I, leading to increased myocyte contractility, lusitropy (active relaxation), and positive chronotropy.37 The second body system affected by catecholamines is vascular smooth muscle. The a,-AR primarily modulates arteriolar smooth muscle tone.38 Activation of the a -- AR causes increased cytosolic cal- cium concentrations resulting in smooth muscle con- traction and an accompanying increase in systemic vascular resistance and MAP.38 Conversely, ß2-AR stim- ulation activates the inhibitory (Gi) signaling pathways in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilatation.39
xagm | Norepinephrine, epinephrine, phenylephrine, and dopamine are potent vasopressors and have compa- rable effects in increasing MAP.28,40 However, phen- ylephrine's exclusive a -AR agonist activity renders it unable to improve cardiac output and therefore should be avoided as a first-line agent for hemodynamic support in CS. Unlike phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine, and dopamine (to a lesser extent) all augment cardiac output through stimulation of the myocyte ß,-AR. However, in contrast with dobu- tamine, dopamine, and epinephrine, norepinephrine has the capacity to improve cardiac output, without significantly increasing heart rate, and therefore may limit increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and potentially attenuate vasoactive medication related myocardial ischemia and injury.31,41,42
