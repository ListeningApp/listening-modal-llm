NOTCH one mediates stable flow-induced cellular alignment, suppression of cell proliferation and maintenance of cell-cell junctional integrity, and protects against atherosclerosis development. These effects have been suggested to be controlled by tension-induced NOTCH one signalling and modulation of intracellular calcium levels. However, another study showed that shear stress-mediated activation of the NOTCH one response requires P I E Z O one, warranting additional clarification regarding the mechanosensory role of NOTCH one. G protein-coupled receptors, such as the proton-sensing G P R six eight, undergo conformational changes in response to flow in endothelial cells, mediating shear-induced calcium influx. Plexin D one, potentially in connection with the junctional mechanosensory complex, mediates flow-dependent atherosclerosis development by regulating calcium uptake, phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor two, A K T, e N O S, E R K one and E R K two, as well as induction of the major flow-sensitive transcription factors, Krüppel-like factor two and Krüppel-like factor four.\np6pq | In cell-cell junctions, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, V E-cadherin and V E G F R two form the junctional mechanosensory complex, which mediates integrin activation, cellular alignment and e N O S activation in response to stable flow via P I three K-A K T signalling. On the basal surface of endothelial cells, flow induces conformational activation and expression changes in extracellular matrix-binding integrin mechanosensors. Stable flow activates the integrin a v beta three, causing increased binding to the extracellular matrix and inactivation of downstream R H O signalling. In addition,\nzse6 | mechanosensors. Mechanosignal transduction pathways include the P I three K-A K T pathway, E R K one-E R K two pathway, Y A P-T A Z pathway and the R H O signalling pathway. Many mechanosignal transduction pathways result in activation of transcription factors including Krüppel-like factor two and Krüppel-like factor four, nuclear factor K B and hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha. End M T, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition; e N O S, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; F A K, focal adhesion kinase; J A M, junctional adhesion molecule; N R F two, nuclear factor erythroid two-related factor two; R O S, reactive oxygen species; S O X thirteen, transcription factor S O X thirteen.\np2n3 | the actin cytoskeleton in the cytosol has been shown to serve as a mechanosensory structure.\nohh7 | Flow mechanosensing in endothelial cells activates numerous early-to-intermediate (seconds to minutes) cell signalling pathways that lead to long-term (hours to days) atheroprotective or pro-atherogenic processes. However, it is important to note that both pro-atherogenic disturbed flow and atheroprotective stable flow often activate many of the same early-to-intermediate signalling pathways, especially in in vitro studies. For example, stable flow transiently activates nuclear factor K B signalling without leading to long-term endothelial inflammation, whereas disturbed flow induces persistent nuclear factor K B activation resulting in endothelial inflammation. The mechanisms that distinguish these flow-pattern-dependent activation pathways, especially in vitro, are not well understood and remain crucial knowledge gaps that need to be filled. This uncertainty is due in part to the common experimental strategy of conducting in vitro studies with endothelial cells cultured under no-flow conditions that are suddenly subjected to stable flow or disturbed flow. Under these conditions, early-to-intermediate responses might overlap with common adaptative changes in response to altered mechanical cues regardless of flow patterns and magnitudes. With this caveat in mind, we review the literature that provides crucial knowledge in understanding flow-dependent endothelial cell mechanosignal transduction pathways.\nvbni | P I E Z O one\ndgcw | P I E Z O one mediates both atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic flow-dependent endothelial cell responses. P I E Z O one mechanosensing of stable flow induces intracellular calcium influx, leading to A T P\ngvwz | release and e N O S activation and the production of the atheroprotective and vasorelaxant nitric oxide from endothelial cells. The P I E Z O one-induced effect on A T P is mediated by the P two Y two and G alpha q eleven pathways, which activate A K T, which in turn activates e N O S. P I E Z O one also mediates pro-atherogenic endothelial responses of disturbed flow. Disturbed flow stimulates nuclear factor K B activity and endothelial inflammation via P I E Z O one-G alpha q eleven-mediated integrin activation, which in turn activates the focal adhesion kinase. Endothelial cell-targeted deletion of P I E Z O one in L D L receptor-knockout mice inhibited atherosclerotic plaque development in disturbed flow regions, suggesting a pro-atherogenic role of P I E Z O one in endothelial cells.\nsk5m | Plexin D one\nqws8 | Plexin D one is another mechanosensor that responds to both stable flow and disturbed flow, mediating both atheroprotective and pro-atherogenic responses, respectively. Knockdown of P l x n d one, which encodes plexin D one, in mouse endothelial cells inhibits atheroprotective signal transduction pathways, such as e N O S activation, cell alignment and Krüppel-like factor two and Krüppel-like factor four expression in response to stable flow. Interestingly, P l x n d one knockout in endothelial cells also prevents pro-atherogenic inflammatory responses, including expression of V C A M one and C C L two in response to disturbed flow. Endothelial cell-specific knockout of P l x n d one in mice prevented atherosclerosis development in arterial regions with disturbed flow but exacerbated plaque development in arterial regions with stable flow. These results suggest that plexin D one is a mechanosensor with dual functions depending on blood flow patterns.\n877u | Junctional mechanosensory complex\nrzhj | Stable flow stimulates e N O S activation through the mechanosensory complex formed by platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, V E-cadherin and V E G F R two or V E G F R three, which in turn activates the P I three K-A K T pathway. Stable flow also induces integrin a v beta three and nuclear factor K B activation through the junctional mechanosensory complex. However, Pecam one knockout in mice prevents endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis in arterial regions with disturbed flow. This finding suggests that platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule is a mechanosensor that mediates pro-atherogenic effects of disturbed flow in vivo.\nbfax | Integrins\nf2y8 | Integrin activation in response to stable flow inactivates R H O G T Pases through R H O-like G T Pase signalling. R H O A inactivation promotes Y A P phosphorylation (at Serine one twenty-seven and Serine three eighty-one) in the cytoplasm to maintain an atheroprotective endothelial cell phenotype. These interactions between integrins and R H O G T Pases further activate R A C, leading to the assembly of the junctional mechanosensory complexes. Additionally, the R H O G T Pase C D C four two is polarized and activated in an integrin-dependent manner and subsequently regulates the polarity of the microtubule-organizing centre. Under disturbed flow conditions, the cooperation between R G D-binding integrins (including alpha five beta one and alpha v beta three integrins) and fibronectin has been shown to drive pro-inflammatory signal transduction involving the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor K B, Y A P and serine/threonine-protein kinase P A K.\no7qm | Flow-sensitive transcription factors\n```",
