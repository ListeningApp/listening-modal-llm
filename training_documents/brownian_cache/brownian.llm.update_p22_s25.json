        "content": "uobn | All the above manipulations can be generalized to many or even infinite degrees of freedom and continuum actions, leading to the Wetterich equation which is directly equivalent to equation A ten, and the relations of section four A. For this work it is important to note that the equilibrium effective potential U of chi discussed here obeys the LPA flow equation exactly if we choose\n3194 | R of k equals k. Appendix B: Derivation of the two point function\nr22o | We start from equation one hundred thirteen repeated here for clarity:\nnupw | the second derivative with respect to t minus Q of t times G of t, t prime equals negative Upsilon divided by P of t times delta of t minus t prime (B one)\n37xs | Where Q of t equals the script U of chi of t is given by equation one hundred fourteen and P of t equals one or zeta sub chi squared of chi of t for LPA and WFR respectively. If we now consider the homogeneous version of equation B one:\nhoi0 | the second derivative of f of t minus Q of t times f of t equals zero (B two)\ntffb | script W of t is defined as Y one of t times the first derivative of Y two of t minus the first derivative of Y one of t times Y two of t equals constant (B three)\newwt | We take Y one of t to be the growing solution and Y two of t to be the decaying solution. Substituting the ansatz G of t, t prime equals Y one of t times F of t, t prime where F is some function to be determined\n2tj1 | into equation B one we obtain: the first derivative of F of t, t prime equals one divided by Y one squared of t times the negative Upsilon times Y one of t prime divided by P of t prime times theta of t minus t prime plus C one of t prime (B four)\nnbhq | where theta of t minus t prime is the Heaviside step function and C one of t prime is a 'constant-of-integration' function of t prime to be determined. If we now integrate equation B four we obtain the following expression for\nw251 | G of t, t prime: G of t, t prime equals negative Upsilon times Y one of t divided by P of t prime times the quantity theta of t minus t prime times the integral from t prime to t of Y one of t prime divided by Y one squared of u d u plus C two of t prime plus C one of t prime times Y one of t times the integral from t to u of d u divided by Y one squared of u (B five)\n1vgx | where C two of t prime is another 'constant-of-integration' function of t prime to be determined. To compute the integrals in B five we note that by the definition of the Wronskian:\nyjnk | Y one of t times the integral from t of script W of u divided by Y one squared of u d u equals mu Y one of t plus Y two of t (B six)\n9zmh | where mu is simply a constant of integration.
