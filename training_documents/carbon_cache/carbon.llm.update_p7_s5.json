        "content": "nv42 | With regard to the individual consumption level, the MPE indicates that at various levels of income and inequality distribution, individuals' propensities to consume more polluting goods differ due to the change in the patterns of consumption level. Hence, Jorgenson declared that consumption level was the key factor influencing the MPE. However, there is not a single hypothesis analyzing the inequality influence on consumption-based carbon dioxide emissions. The main condition of the changes in income inequality affecting the consumption-based carbon emissions depends\n\nxags | on the MPE ratio between materially wealthy and poor people. If poor people's MPE is bigger than that of the wealthy, an increase in inequality reduces carbon dioxide emissions. Authors assumed that due to higher prices resulting from environmentally friendly production, the poorest people cannot afford to buy any of these products. Furthermore, these people are not inclined to choose to use renewable electricity. Moreover, larger income distribution would decrease individuals' environmental concern, and vice versa, the environmental quality is more important for rich people and they have higher environmental concern. The assumption that the MPE is bigger if compared with richer countries corresponds to the Keynesian model when lower-income individuals, rather than higher income, have a higher marginal tendency to consume, so the growth of inequality reduces the income of the poor and decreases the emissions. A large number of authors identified that the MPE falls with the level of income. Meanwhile, if low-income individuals have a lower level of MPE than the high income, the growth of income inequality raises carbon dioxide emissions. Authors declared that due to different consumption levels, the rich people more negatively influence environmental impact than the poor individuals. Furthermore, according to authors, the rich people are not necessarily pro-environmentally friendly, and they are not willing to assume the responsibility and the costs of environmental issues. Therefore, the reduction of income inequality is shown to reduce consumption-based carbon pollution, which suggests that the reduction of income inequality and carbon dioxide emissions can be achieved simultaneously. In other case, when the income inequality is more balanced, the consumption of more polluting goods increases due to the shift of poor people to the middle class. Hence, inequality can raise the middle social groups' willingness to achieve the superior (wealthy) social group's patterns of consumption (Veblen effect), causing greater environmental impact by increasing the consumption level.\n\njc47 | Insignificant relationship between inequality and pollution reveals that when income becomes more equally distributed, the individuals from the poor class will increase their consumption of energy and other polluting products as they transfer to the middle class. Thus, when the three classes of individuals (poor, middle and rich) are considered, the relationship\n\nko3c | between inequality and environmental pollution may not be linear. The propensity to emit may rise and then descend, which causes the curvilinear link between inequality and environmental pollution. Furthermore, constant emission intensity across the income classes would reveal that any income redistribution would have an insignificant or no impact on consumption-based emissions. In conclusion, the possible influence of inequality on environmental pollution via individual behaviors depends on MPE and changes in the social norms.\n\nxek3 | Conclusions\n\nbbpr | In recent decades, the environmental research has paid much attention to the analysis whether the reduction of income inequality and pollution related to climate change could be achieved simultaneously. By reviewing the selected papers published from two thousand one to twenty nineteen, where these experts empirically evaluated the impact of inequality on carbon emissions, the author of the present article identified that the links between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions were different in developing and developed countries. The different results reveal that the role of inequality on carbon dioxide pollution is quite versatile. Referring to Kuznets curve, which was applied for both income inequality and environmental quality, it was assumed that the aforementioned different results could derive from the different trajectories of Kuznets curve. Therefore, if countries trace the same trajectory of Kuznets curve, a positive impact of inequality on environmental impact is observed. If environmental impact matches the right side of the EKC but income inequality has not reached the turn point at the same economic development level and stays on the left side of Kuznets curve, a negative relationship between the level of inequality and pollution is recognized. The negative relationship between inequality and carbon dioxide emissions is observed when the U-shaped trajectory of one variable occurs instead of the inverted U-shape. An insignificant relationship could be observed when the country's pollution or inequality level matches the turn point. These Kuznets curve trajectory differences depend on the differences of impact channels through which economic development affects inequality and environmental pollution. This paper presented the following four channels: one. scale, two. composition, three. technique and four. globalization, through which economic development affects both carbon dioxide emissions and inequality level.\n\n5zyf | The majority of authors have analyzed theoretical links of inequality impact on carbon dioxide emissions with regard to territorial (or production-based) emissions. This paper suggested to consider the production-based and consumption-based emissions separately when analyzing the approaches to relationship between inequality and pollution. Therefore, the proposed\n\n9own | theories according to the origin of emissions were distinguished and new approaches which could explain the influence of income inequality on carbon dioxide emissions were provided.",
