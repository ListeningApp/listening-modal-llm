        "content": "m1hx | Although the Gold, Silver, Bronze Command Structure is recognised as being the most effective way to manage security operations that are bigger than a one-team operation, there are a number of potential problems that are repeatedly identified as causing problems both in the planning and development stages of security management, as well as in actually responding to incidents.\n9psh | The first potential problem, and one that is almost always identified as one of the critical causes of operation failure, is communications. More precisely, it is the failure of the transfer of complex information under pressure. Carl von Clausewitz, the great Prussian strategist, coined the phrase 'Fog of War' in eighteen thirty-seven to describe the general chaos and uncertainty that almost always accompanies operational activity. As organisational complexity increases, due to more levels of command and a greater number of different teams, the pressures created by responding to unfamiliar or unknown situations whilst having to operate with less than full information creates an environment where information can be easily lost, misheard or misunderstood.\naiqv | This can be the case even when the security operation is run by the best trained operation managers in the country. The Jean Charles de Menezes incident in two thousand five, when an innocent Brazilian student was mistakenly shot by armed police counter terrorism teams, was in a large part due to a misunderstanding as to the nature of the threat. Was it a 'normal stop', or was it part of Operation Kratos - a stop with possibility of a 'critical shot' to prevent the immediate detonation of a suicide bomber? Despite the clear national threat, and a whole range of briefings, there was still lack of agreement in the report given by one of the officers who made the critical shot, and Commander Cressida Dick, who was acting as Gold Commander at the time, and who had denied giving any order that would have triggered 'Operation Kratos'. The report into the de Menezes incident by the Independent Police Complaints Commission gives a good insight into some of the issues of command and control in the pressures of immediate incident response.\n4klz | An associated problem with the transfer of information is stove-piping, or when different departments don't share information with each other. This can be because there is simply a lack of available channels to exchange information, or can be because different departments see other departments as possible rivals for influence, and therefore see the control of information as a way of maintaining their own power position. This was certainly the case in the run up to Nine Eleven, when the lack of open communication between CIA and FBI (on both an official and informal, personal basis), meant that information that was known and on the record was not shared.\nxz5d | A third problem connected with a hierarchical Gold, Silver, Bronze command system is that often the situation being dealt with demands an immediate response, but the command system means that it takes a long time to transfer information to the decision-makers, who then spend time discussing the situation, and only then start issues instructions as to how to respond. This is true whether the situation is a national disaster such as Hurricane Katrina or snow blocking UK airports, or a local office complaining that the road to their warehouse is blocked, and they need to make alternative arrangements. In most cases, the most effective use of the Gold, Silver, Bronze system is to devolve authority to the lowest appropriate level. In other words, if one level of decision maker has the ability to make the decision, there is nothing to be gained by having to go higher up the command chain to receive authority for that decision.\nerwx | Six point four And finally ....\nie7i | As in all security management programmes, the success of the system lies not in drawing pretty command plans with boxes and arrows, but in ensuring that everyone involved in the operation knows what they are doing, understands what they are trying to achieve, and are able to exchange information and make decisions on an on-going basis.\naksw | The Gold, Silver, Bronze command System works best when there are three criteria that are met. Firstly, that all of the groups within the system share the same basic culture and 'risk recognition'. Every security manager knows the\n0fsl | frustration from talking with Head Office administrators who don't understand the seriousness or immediacy of a problem! Secondly, the different people involved in the organisation know each other on a personal basis, and are able to work together effectively for a common cause. And thirdly, that the various teams have worked together in training situations, either with table-top exercises for the team leaders and commanders, or in real-time with the different operational teams.\n0m3g | Creating multi-team operational capability is not something that can be left to chance, or can be established once a crisis situation has occurred. The development of such capabilities is something that must be managed over time in a continuous cycle of learning, reviewing and improvement. Figure seventeen shows one method of achieving this, namely the preparedness cycle.\n9sp0 | Six point five Summary\nnbpk | As soon as a security management system involves more than a single person, then a Command and Control structure will need to be in to ensure that all aspects of the security management programme are coordinated and controlled in an effective and professional manner. The Command and Control Structure should be able to manage Routine Activities, Minor Incidents and Crisis Situations, and should allow information to be passed up the command chain from front-line responds who have information on any situation and instructions to be passed down the command chain from managers who may well be located far away from the incident site. The ability to create effective command chains is at the heart of effective security management, and it is almost always the case that it is failures in command chain management that is one of the major causes of most security management failures.\nxs3r | In summary:\nffuj | A three-level command system - Gold, Silver, Bronze - can be applied to any security operation, and clearly sets out the responsibility associated with each command level\nh7f6 | The purpose of any command system is two-fold: to allow information to be passed up the command chain, and orders and directions to be passed down\nt74k | If a command system fails, it is almost always because there has been a break-down in communication\nqdn7 | Additional complexity increases the likelihood of failure\ndib4 | Command systems work best when all of the people involved in the operation know each other, have worked together before, and share a common organisational culture\nyvqj | The more you train together, the more successful the response operation will be\nvz2f | Six point six Self-assessment exercises",
