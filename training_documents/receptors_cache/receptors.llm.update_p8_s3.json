        "content": "6pmo | Viruses can also exploit host GPCRs to promote viral pathogenesis and survival by expressing virally encoded GPCR agonists or antagonists in order to modulate host cell signalling. For example, KHSV encodes multiple viral cytokines, which have significant sequence similarity to host chemokine agonists and antagonists and can bind to host GPCRs to mediate functions such as chemotaxis of immune cells, and resistance to apoptosis. Alternatively, these proteins can bind to and inactivate host-produced ligands in order to shut off or abrogate host immune response.\n195r | ent\nkqmi | The Mutation Spectrum of GPCRs in Cancer\ng8rd | The generation of vast cancer sequencing resources including The Cancer Genome Atlas, and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer have revealed that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins are collectively mutated in roughly twenty percent of all cancers, spanning across numerous tumor types. This is aligned with mutation frequencies of some of the most well-studied cancer-related pathways, including the receptor tyrosine kinase, R.A.S., M.A.P.K., and P fifty-three pathways, which are mutated at forty-six percent and twenty-nine percent of all cancers\nnns9 | respectively. Despite this staggering number, the biological function and consequence of many of these GPCR and heterotrimeric G protein mutations are as of yet largely unknown due to the numerous factors that influence the prediction of cancer-driving mutations. For example, the contribution of gene length must be weighed against the number of mutations in a given gene. Coupled with this, many of the mutations in GPCRs are not isolated to hotspot residues, further hindering efforts to predict their signalling and cellular impact and potential role in cancer. As a result, it has been difficult to infer the biological contexts in which mutations in GPCRs have cancer-driving effects as compared to passenger mutations with little functional impact. Towards this end, there have been numerous recent advances in cancer genomics and methodology aimed at identifying significantly mutated genes, and their associated biological consequences. For example, the MutSig suite of tools builds a model based on several characteristics, including the mutation burden of a gene relative to the background mutation rate of each tissue, mutation clustering within a gene and potential hotspots, and the evolutionary conservation of mutations. These features are then integrated to obtain gene-level mutation significance. For our analysis we have included data generated using MutSig two CV, which refines the background mutation rate predictions by incorporating parameters of mutational heterogeneity such as DNA replication timing and transcriptional activity. To complement measurements of mutation significance, other approaches have been used to predict the pathogenicity of mutations in cancer, including investigating phylogenetic conservation, allele frequency, proximity to specific genomic features, mapping mutations to protein domains, and assessing patterns of mutual exclusivity with other mutations. In tandem, the integration of rapidly growing mechanistic data are beginning to shed light on the molecular basis of how cancer-associated mutations may be playing a role, including the systematic mapping of cancer-related alterations on a pathway level.\n9uwy | Of particular relevance to GPCR-driven signalling, structure-function analyses of mutations in GPCRs have begun to provide insight on these observations and a new framework of the functional impact of GPCR mutations is emerging. Projection of cancer-related mutations for T.S.H.R., for example, have revealed an accumulation of mutations clustered at the cytoplasmic tail of helix six, suggesting that in the absence of a physical hotspot mutation, structural motif hotspots may be more prevalent manifestations of cancer-associated GPCR mutations. Indeed, our recent pan-cancer analysis of functional somatic mutations in gene families has demonstrated significant enrichment of mutations in a handful of highly conserved regions of GPCRs that regulate GPCR function and activation. These include mutations localized to the D.R.Y. motif, which mediates the inactive conformation of class A GPCRs, with particular emphasis on\nsrly | recurrent mutations in D.R.Y. arginine, in addition to the N.P.X.X.Y. motif, both of which are critical regulators of GPCR activation. Mutations in these positions show statistically significant mutual exclusivity between motifs, as well as with activating hotspot mutations in the G alpha subunit further supporting the functional significance of these structure-based predictions. D.R.Y. arginine mutations are also mutually exclusive with many common mutant oncogenes that are downstream of GPCR-mediated signalling cascades, including A.K.T. E seventeen K, P.I.K. three C.A. E five forty-five K and J.A.K. two V six seventeen F. In many cases where the full G-protein-coupling repertoire of GPCRs has not been fully elucidated, recent efforts to systematically predict the G protein-coupling selectivity of GPCRs via functional interaction studies have provided novel insights into these coupling determinants and the subsequent implications both from a structural, and signalling perspective. Integration of this information with other data types including aforementioned mutation and structure-function analyses will continue to widen and clarify our view of the impact of cancer-associated mutations in GPCRs.\ndl6i | Broken down phylogenetically, the adhesion and glutamate GPCR are highly mutated families of GPCRs in cancer; however, their role in cancer is not well defined. Adhesion GPCRs are named as such due to the extended extracellular N terminus containing structural domains such as thrombospondin repeats, and leucine-rich-repeats, which participate in a variety of protein-protein interactions and can mediate adhesion to cellular matrix proteins. The adhesion GPCR subfamily is widely mutated among cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas and a number of adhesion GPCRs are involved in angiogenesis, metastasis, and other critical components of cancer initiation and progression. Among them, GPR98 ADGRV1 is the most frequently mutated GPCR across all cancer types. In particular ADGRV1 is mutated in roughly forty-five percent of skin cutaneous melanoma, and is the longest GPCR by amino acid length; however, not much is known regarding its functional impact. ADGRE5, also known as CD97, was the first adhesion GPCR to be linked to cancer, as its expression was found to be a sensitive marker of dedifferentiation in thyroid carcinomas. While ADGRE5 expression was nearly absent in normal thyrocytes, its levels increased in correlation with thyroid tumor stage. Its overexpression has since been identified in several other cancer types including pancreatic, gallbladder, and esophageal carcinomas, and is linked to metastatic aggressiveness in gastric, colorectal cancers, and particularly in glioblastoma. Glioblastoma in particular, is known to develop extensive intratumoral hypoxia, and GPR133 ADGRD1 has been implicated to be critical for glioblastoma growth under hypoxic conditions.",
