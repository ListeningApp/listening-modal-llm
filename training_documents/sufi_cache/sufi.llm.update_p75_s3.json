        "content": "oial | The coincidence of some similarity between the words 'Adam (not-being) and Aadam (man) has caused poets and others in Eastern languages to equate the two neatly in verse and prose. It is interesting to note, by the way, that even orientalists and reviewers, discussing this point, sometimes observe so little of this play on words that they even charge Sufi writers with being ignorant or adopting strange usages when they say such things as 'Man is 'adam'. I often feel that this uncharacteristic failure to register the contention is in such cases due to the fact that the subjectivity of the commentator is censoring his understanding: he is, after all, generally a man-as a man he does not want to think of himself as 'not-being'. This is all the more marked in people (who do of course include scholars) who actually identify themselves by means of the learnt patterns and information-stock which is, to the Sufi, part of the non-being, the personality and not the essence, of humankind.\n8xfx | In other words, as we all know, pride prevents humility. Pride is attached to a sense of oneself which may be wholly or partially created by secondary things like believing that one is learned.\npgp5 | It has truly been said that \"Humility is not so much a virtue as a necessity, in order to learn.'\n8rz1 | Rabia and the Door\nxhb4 | The posture which is required in the Sufi was well illustrated by Rabia al-Adawiyya. She heard that Salih of Qazwin was teaching by the phrase: 'Knock at the Door and it will be opened to you.'\nkext | Rabia said: \"How long will you persist in saying this, O Salih-when that Door has never been shut?'\ntshv | The lack of humility is also something of a conspiracy: where\narau | people not only ignore it when it is found in others, but cannot credit its reality. This is in addition to those who cannot even conceive how or when to exercise it.\ni36b | Tale of the Professor\nx6yc | Not long ago (pursuing the first remark) I was showing a visitor around the grounds of this house. As we passed a quiet and diligent man sitting on the ground mending a piece of wood, the visitor asked: \"Who is that?'\nxcfx | I said: 'That is Professor So-and-So.'\nybu5 | His brow creased into a frown, and he looked at him again. Then he looked at me. Now he said: 'Are you sure?'\nwxhx | And, pursuing the second remark, there is the incident involving Maaruf of Karkh.\nf4i3 | Collecting Date Stones\navlk | Sari al-Saqati saw Maaruf picking up the stones of dates from the ground and asked him what he was doing.\nvi9g | 'A child was crying,' he said, 'because, being a penniless orphan, he had no nuts like other children. So I am going to collect date-stones and sell them [to be ground into flour] so that he can have some nuts, and be happy.'\ntyl7 | How Serious is the Student?\n2hpu | Question: I have heard you say that many of the people who imagine that they are serious about the study of Sufism are in fact not serious at all; and because of that cannot benefit from it. Can I have an example?\na10k | Answer: One of the best examples is a matter of our daily experience. People read books or hear things about Sufism, and immediately proceed to 'beat a path to our door'. Now, at this juncture I have published sixteen books on Sufi ideas and action. One would infer, surely, that if I am publishing this material - and in such quantities and with such energy - that we regard its publication, and hence its study, as important.\n2pp5 | But out of the average of ten thousand or so letters received each year, a significant proportion of all people are found to be 'serious' (as they claim) without bothering to read the material. If they were serious, they would give it serious attention. If, as they so often state, they don't want written materials, why do they apply to me, since I am dealing partly in written materials? People come to see me, not having a sound grasp of what we are saying - because they have not studied our literature - and so I cannot help them.\nl20h | They come from all over the world, spending money and wasting time, but they won't spend money on books, won't give time to their study. Do you imagine that one can regard such people as 'serious'? Admittedly, they constitute only a minority of all our contacts, but the large total number of people contacting me means that this minority still adds up to a sizeable total number of individuals. If you want to assess someone, look at what he does, and ignore his protestations of 'being serious' - at least for the moment. If he is acting seriously, you will be more inclined to accept his claim to be serious. If he is only saying it, no matter how strongly he may believe it, we can only conclude that he has little or no idea of what he is really doing, and hence I would\nkfwj | be the last person to be able to be of use to him, especially since he is first in need of elementary instruction in straight thinking.\n7hi1 | Knowledge as Perception\nvpa2 | In these days, as in the past, what is generally called knowledge is a great 'Veil' to understanding. Gazur-i-Ilahi reminds his hearers that there is scholastic and observational learning. Inner knowledge - perception - is the real form of knowledge. The one is like knowing about honey by studying it, the other to know it by taste.\nmtlg | One is knowing. The other is only knowing about knowing.\n6rz3 | What seems to be a lack of 'seriousness' is really better referred to by your second definition: that people cannot benefit. The reason why is that they lack a desire to pay attention to what is said and done.\noxdb | Cheese and the Moon\nv978 | When we talk about the 'seriousness' of the student, we have to remember that many people have very little idea what serious study might mean. It often means, for them, compulsive study, whether there is any product or not. You may have noted that the British Association for the Advancement of Science (of which I admit to being a Life Member, by the way) held a meeting at which the discoveries announced included:\nuqzw | That moon rock shares properties with Cheddar and Emmental cheese; that in general fat people do not go to universities; that rats prefer listening to Mozart rather than Schoenberg. This wasn't in the Middle Ages, with angels dancing on pins, but in nineteen seventy of the Christian Era ...\n56yl | Social and Psychological Elements in Sufi Study\nr00c | Question: Are you reducing metaphysical and spiritual studies to the level of sociology and psychology?\nbhhp | Answer: No, I am, on the contrary, trying to show the contaminants and confusions from socializing and popular psychology in these studies. If people think that they are worshipping God when they are in reality seeking emotional excitement, this can hardly be to everyone's advantage. If the sensations aroused by transfer of emotions from one person, or one system, to another are thought to be 'special', when they are extensively described and illustrated as normal social actions and developments, what harm is there in affirming the truth?\nbyke | Question: It is often said that it is better to leave people with their beliefs, rather than to disturb them.\nz2w8 | Answer: If the belief is equivalent to believing that an appendix pain is the work of the devil, it is wrong to leave the patient with it, for he is likely to die.\n1l0m | The Man Who Fell Off a Mountain",
