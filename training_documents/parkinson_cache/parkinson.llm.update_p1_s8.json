While progress has been made in understanding the neurodegenerative mechanisms that lead to cell death in late stages of Parkinson's disease, mechanisms for early, causal pathogenic events are still elusive. Recent developments in Parkinson's disease genetics increasingly point at endolysosomal system dysfunction as the early pathomechanism and key pathway affected in Parkinson's disease. Clathrin-mediated synaptic endocytosis, an integral part of the neuronal endolysosomal system, is probably the main early target as evident in auxilin, RME-eight, and synaptojanin-one mutations that cause Parkinson's disease. Autophagy, another important pathway in the endolysosomal system, is crucial in maintaining proteostasis and a healthy mitochondrial pool, especially in neurons considering their inability to divide and requirement to function an entire lifetime. PINK-one and Parkin mutations severely perturb autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy), both in the cell body and synaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons, leading to Parkinson's disease. Endolysosomal sorting and trafficking is also crucial, which is complex in multi-compartmentalised neurons. VPS35 and VPS13C mutations noted in Parkinson's disease target these mechanisms. Mutations in GBA comprise the most common risk factor for Parkinson's disease and initiate pathology by compromising lysosomal function. This is also the case for ATP13A2 mutations. Interestingly, alpha-synuclein and LRRK2, key proteins involved in Parkinson's disease, function in different steps of the endolysosomal pathway and target their components to induce disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss these endolysosomal system genes that are linked to Parkinson's disease and how their dysfunction results in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.\nx815 | The endolysosomal system is increasingly recognized as the key pathway affected in Parkinson's disease. Clathrin-mediated synaptic endocytosis, an integral part of the neuronal endolysosomal system, is probably the main early target. Autophagy, another important endolysosomal pathway that aids in maintaining proteostasis and a healthy mitochondrial pool is affected. Other crucial pathways such as endolysosomal sorting and trafficking, along with lysosomal degradation are also hampered. Key Parkinson's disease proteins such as alpha-synuclein and LRRK2 target the endolysosomal components to induce pathology. Here, we comprehensively discuss these mechanisms to better understand the role of endolysosomal system dysfunction in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.\nepbj | Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, clinically identified by motor symptoms, with an increasing recognition of non-motor manifestations. Loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, forty to fifty percent and the presence of alpha-synuclein pathology in surviving neurons are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. At the onset of motor symptoms, dopamine levels have decreased sixty to seventy percent in the dorsal striatum, where most substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons form synaptic connections. Under physiological conditions, alpha-synuclein is predominantly present in presynaptic terminals, aiding neurotransmitter release, whereas in Parkinson's disease, alpha-synuclein tends to aggregate and form Lewy bodies (the defining alpha-synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease). Aggregation of alpha-synuclein, perturbed proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired calcium homeostasis are the major cell-autonomous mechanisms of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Non-\nnmn2 | One. Endolysosomal system in neurons: Custom-made for neuronal function\ng3tm | cell-autonomous mechanisms include cell-to-cell transmission of pathological alpha-synuclein and neuroinflammation. So far, incomplete knowledge on causal mechanisms has limited treatment strategies to symptomatic relief. Recent studies targeting the endolysosomal system reveal that its dysfunction can lead to the mentioned disease mechanisms, suggesting the endolysosomal system as a key pathway in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss important endolysosomal system components, their roles in neuronal survival, and how their dysfunction causes Parkinson's disease.\ntfra | The endolysosomal system comprises of complex, highly dynamic membrane-enclosed tubular- vesicular structures with overlapping properties and functions. They facilitate nutritional intake from a cell's microenvironment through endocytosis, neutralize pathogenic materials via phagocytosis, promote cellular proteostasis through autophagy, and maintain overall cellular homeostasis through endosomal sorting and trafficking of various proteins and enzymes across organelles. Endolysosomal system functions vary greatly depending on cell type and functional state. Neurons are unique in their highly polarized intracellular compartmentalization of cell body or soma and processes including axons, axon terminals, and dendrites. This organization enables them to form complicated networks that mediate specialized functions. This complexity comes at a price: burdensome demands on the endolysosomal system, which have been increasingly implicated in neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease.\n5lm9 | In neurons, synthesis of endolysosomal components occurs primarily in the cell body or soma. These components are trafficked through the secretory pathway to their subcellular location. A prime example of this is lysosomal hydrolase trafficking. Lysosomal hydrolases are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, then undergo glycosylation and other post- translational modifications at the Golgi apparatus. This modification directs hydrolases to lysosomes. More specifically, hydrolases form complexes with transmembrane mannose-six-phosphate receptors, which are sequestered into clathrin-coated vesicle (CCVs) budding from the trans-Golgi networks to form endosomes or early endosomes. Inside early endosomes, mannose-six-phosphate receptors detach from hydrolases and are recycled back to the trans-Golgi network for their next round of transport, while hydrolases are delivered to lysosomes.\nwp2c | Simultaneously, early endosomes are also derived from the cell surface through the endocytic pathway, an integral part of the endolysosomal system. Many of the nutrients required for neuronal function and surface receptors designated for recycling are internalised through clathrin-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane and delivered to early endosomes. Early endosomes derived from both the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane mature into late endosomes, where Rab-five and Rab-seven play a prominent role. This process occurs with the help of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, which facilitates ubiquitin-dependent sorting of cargo and hydrolases from the outer membrane of early endosomes into interluminal vesicles.\n```",
