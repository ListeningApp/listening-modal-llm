Did the Provost consult members of the College A and P Committee before writing to withdraw Dr. Amegah's application?\nsy14 | vi. Based on the Provost's reason given for withdrawing his petition, is Dr Amegah not being punished for holding onto a petition he believes in and for which the A and P board has a statutory responsibility to determine?\nghss | vii. What caused the over one-month lag between the date DHR letter was written and when Dr Amegah received his copy? Was it a matter of someone in authority asking DHR to backdate the letter returning of his documents?\n3s61 | viii. Was it an A and P Board decision to return Dr. Amegah's regular promotion documents to him?\ns3rm | C. Wrongful and Capricious Interpretation and Illegal Application of a Committee's Recommendation to Override the University's Statutes and Promotion Criteria\npqxb | i. In twenty sixteen, some persons were appointed to the ranks of Lecturer and Senior Lecturers at the fledgling School of Medical Sciences in accordance with the twenty twelve Statutes of the University. Some of the persons appointed as Lecturers were later upgraded to the rank of Senior Lecturer.\n08qc | ii. In their appointment letters, no special criteria other than the promotion criteria would be applied to their next promotion. It was thus understood that promotion from the rank of Senior Lecturer to Associate Professor would require submission of seven papers, while promotion from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer would require submission of five refereed papers for assessment as was the normal requirements.\nhdj2 | iii. Later in the same year, UTAG in a letter dated fifth May twenty sixteen, raised concerns that the appointments and upgrade were in breach of the Statutes of the University, particularly because the appointees :-\na57g | iv. did not possess PhD in the relevant field;\ng8m3 | V. did not have the required years of teaching and research experience; and\na9av | vi. did not have the required number of refereed publications.\n73l3 | vii. The issue of assessment of the papers considered in the appointments and upgrade was not one of the issues raised by UTAG.\nornm | viii. Council set up a Committee to look into the issue. The Committee concluded that all the appointments were meritorious and in accordance with the Statutes at the time (twenty twelve Statutes) of the University. Some of the appointees indeed possessed PhD, had the required teaching/research experience and had the necessary number of refereed publications. Those who did not have the required number of papers were deemed to have been appointed under the Exceptional Case Clause in Schedule D of the Statutes.\nu2z1 | ix. The Ad Hoc Committee went on to recommend, among others, that \"the\natmh | Clinicians who were upgraded to the rank of Senior Lecturer should obtain the required minimum of twelve refereed papers before promotion to the next rank of Associate Professor. Those who do not possess terminal qualifications (Fellowships) should be encouraged to do so\".\n7hgg | X. Council adopted the recommendation for implementation but how it was to be enforced was never communicated to the affected members. Convocation learnt that the Appointments and Promotions Board, on the insistence of the Vice-Chancellor, sought the assistance of the Governing Council for interpretation of the above recommendation. The letter from the Appointments and Promotions Board requesting the assistance of Council in interpreting recommendation six point one point one of the twenty sixteen Ad hoc Committee was clear that the implementation of the contentious recommendation presented implementation challenges. The Board therefore sought Council's interpretation \"to facilitate the work of the Board in considering promotion applications from the category of staff mentioned in the Report \".\nxwsv | xi. That meant that the Board was expected to apply the interpretation to pending applications of any of the Clinicians listed in the Report of the twenty sixteen Committee. Council constituted a Committee to do the interpretation.\n756b | xii. It has come to our notice that the Committee's interpretation, which was adopted by Council, has been forwarded to the Provost of CoHAS, instead of applying it to the pending applications alluded to.\n6bx7 | Convocation therefore, seeks answers to the following questions :-\nspl6 | i. How has the interpretation of the recommendation been applied to promotion applications before the Appointments and Promotions Board cited in the Memorandum which led to the setting up of the Interpretation Committee?\n7wzm | ii. How has the interpretation of the contentious recommendation addressed the so-called implementation challenges encountered by the Appointments and Promotions Committee?\ne9xj | iii. Has the Vice-Chancellor written to the affected person on the status of their promotions in light of the interpretation of the recommendation in question?\n9vl6 | iv. Is the Provost of CoHAS aware, as a matter of fact, of the persons whose applications are affected by the interpretation and in any event, is it proper and right for the Provost to apply the interpretation to applications before the Appointments and Promotions Board?\nc2fd | v. Has the Appointments and Promotions Board applied the recommendations of the twenty sixteen Ad Hoc Committee on any person and communicated the same to any person?\njzvp | vi. Can the Clinicians whose promotion applications are affected by the interpretation add on to the papers already submitted to be assessed in which\nf71y | case the date of first application will determine the effective date of the promotion?\n31e1 | It is hereby requested that, without any satisfactory answers to the above questions, the promotion applications of the affected Clinicians should be brought to Council for consideration in light of the interpretation of the recommendation. This is because it appears that the Appointments and Promotions Board has shown that it is incapable of taking a decision based on the earlier Committees' report or the interpretation by recent Council Committee's interpretation.\n40ry | D. Undue Delays in Processing of Promotion Papers\nd1j2 | i. The University has always been concerned about undue delays in processing of promotion papers.\nwstc | ii. To address the issues, the Criteria for the Appointments and Promotions have been designed and amended in course of time to address the problem considering the impact of such delays on staff morale.\nba1e | iii. For instance in the current Criteria for Appointments and Promotions, duration for internal assessment shall not exceed two weeks of receipt of the application by the Head of Department or Dean or Provost: part seven point four. Furthermore, the duration for consideration and submission of a promotion application to the Dean by the Head of Department shall not exceed two weeks; any delay should be explained in writing to the Dean. Similarly, the duration for consideration of submission of the application to the Provost shall not exceed three weeks after consideration by the Faculty/School.\nen95 | iv. Finally, and most importantly, the duration for consideration by the Appointments and Promotions Board and submission to external assessors shall not exceed one month. In order that the applicant is updated periodically on the state of the application, the Provost is required to provide formal communication within every two months on the status of applications to applicants.\nl3do | v. Apart from the timelines spelt out in the Criteria for Appointments and Promotions to deal with the delays, the Criteria has provided that applications that are not processed (received by external assessors) shall be reconsidered by the Provost.\nu9bo | vi. Despite these provisions in the Criteria to ensure speedy consideration of promotion applications, there are instances of unreasonable delays that appear intentional and borne out of vindictiveness.\n7avo | vii. This has demoralized those affected and resulted in the University losing some experienced Faculty Members to other sister Universities in the country. The others are contemplating leaving the University.\nuzo6 | viii. One such person is Dr. Samuel Essien-Baidoo. The facts of the case are as follows. Dr Essien-Baidoo applied for promotion to the rank of Associate Professor in twenty nineteen\n89b4 | through the regular mode. However, he did not receive any official communication on the application until eleventh February twenty twenty-one; three clear years after submission of the application. In that correspondence he was only informed that one assessor had submitted his assessment report. It is baffling if not strange that it would take two years for external assessors to submit their report.\n```",
