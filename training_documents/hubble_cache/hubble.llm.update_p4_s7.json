        "content": "nwfz | T is greater than M sub E. In order to find constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis on power-law cosmology parameters, we utilize t sub zero approximately thirteen point seven Gyr (age of the Universe) estimated by Komatsu et al. on the basis of seven year data from WMAP and astrophysical data from other sources. Further, the model is assumed to have current temperature T sub zero equals two point seven two eight K. The primordial nucleosynthesis requires that t is less than or equal to eight eight seven T approximately eighty keV. This puts the following constraints on Q and\nnvfy | H sub zero: We observe that primordial nucleosynthesis requires decelerating expansion (Q is greater than zero) of the Universe within the framework of power-law cosmology. This is contrary to outcome of accelerated expansion (Q is less than zero) of the Universe obtained in earlier sections by using latest data sets of H of z and SNe Ia observations. Also the primordial nucleosynthesis forces the Hubble constant H sub zero less than or equal to forty-one point four nine, which is much smaller than its values estimated in earlier by using the updated data sets of H of z and SNe Ia. This shows that the power-law cosmological models which succeed in mimicking the nucleosynthesis scenario are in conflict with the constraints obtained on power-law cosmology parameters by using the latest observational data from H of z and SNe Ia. A similar conclusion on power-law cosmologies was drawn by Kaplinghat et al. However, in the case at hand, it has been done with updated observational data sets and the constraints have been obtained on both the parameters Q and\nmror | H sub C. Seven CONSTRAINTS ON STATEFINDERS IN POWER-LAW COSMOLOGY\nzlxc | The Hubble parameter H equals a dot over A and deceleration parameter Q equals negative a double dot over A H squared are useful geometric parameters in cosmology, which describe the expansion history of the Universe. For instance, H is greater than zero (A dot is greater than zero) indicates an expanding Universe while Q less than zero (A double dot greater than zero) characterizes an accelerated expansion of the Universe. In order to explain accelerated expansion\nk0bw | of the Universe, various dark energy models have been proposed in the literature. However, these models encounter degeneracy on the geometric parameters H (involving first time derivative of scale factor) and Q (involving second time derivative of scale factor) at the present epoch (Malekjani and\naq5a | Khadom-Mohamaddi). Thus the geometric parameters H and Q are not capable of discriminating between different dark energy models and a viable diagnostic tool is required for this purpose. Sahni et al. proposed a pair of parameters R, S called statefinders as a means of distinguish-\nsc5y | ing between different dark energy models. The statefinders involve derivatives of scale factor up to third order and are defined as\n0yab | R equals A dot over A H cubed, S equals R minus one over three (Q minus one half). and'\nw95z | The remarkable feature of statefinders is that these parameters depend on scale factor and its time derivatives, and hence are geometric in nature (Sahni). Further, different dark energy models exhibit different evolutionary trajectories in the S-R plane. Moreover, the well known flat ACDM model corresponds to the point S equals zero and R equals one in the S-R plane (Alam et al.). These features of statefinders provide an opportunity to distinguish between different dark energy models. The statefinder diagnostic tool has been extensively used in the literature as a means to distinguish between different dark energy models. In what follows, we test the power-law cosmology by statefinder diagnostic tool.\n0i1k | In power-law cosmology, the statefinders read as R equals two Q squared plus Q and\ndqlg | where",
