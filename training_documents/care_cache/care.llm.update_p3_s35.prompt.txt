You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0fpw | Consideration of the context for the research also differs sub- stantively across the efficacy-effectiveness-implementation spectrum. Efficacy trials value conducting a trial that is invariant from beginning to end. This entails sometimes extraordinary efforts at training clin- icians and tracking subjects, so that the research team's efforts amount at times to "crypto-case management" (i.e., aggressive subject engage- ment and follow-up outreach) to ensure close follow-up and minimal data loss-which is not a problem since the focus of the trial is solely on testing the intervention under optimal conditions. However, since ef- fectiveness studies are more concerned with performance of an effica- cious intervention in real-world settings, careful attention is paid to limiting the amount of research-funded effort that is incorporated into the protocol, often "firewalling" research effort with carefully and ex- plicitly defined parameters (Bauer et al., 2001). Further, for im- plementation trials, trying to optimize the natural context in which uptake is being measured is a threat to validity of the trial. Thus, re- searcher involvement at the sites is drastically circumscribed, with
dqn8 | some implementation trials even limiting research support to training endogenous clinicians and utilizing remote, "light-touch" outcome as- sessments for patient and provider subjects (see also Smith, this issue).
cop0 | These differences across the efficacy-effectiveness-implementation spectrum are reflected in radically different priorities regarding trial validity (Loudeon et al., 2015). As noted above (Section 2), in efficacy studies internal validity prioritizes establishing a causal connection between the intervention and the outcome; in the service of this aim, the sample, outcome measurements, and intervention are all highly controlled without consideration of applicability beyond the specific trial itself. In effectiveness studies, external validity prioritizes the generalizability of trial results to other relevant populations and si- tuations; accordingly, although the effectiveness trial must have suffi- cient internal validity to carry out the study successfully, explicit design decisions are made that value generalizability beyond the trial itself. Finally, implementation trials, in contrast to both types of clinical trials, aim at arriving at the optimal implementation strategy, and maximal innovation impact, by the end of the study. Note, however, that in subtle ways such "mid-course corrections" are the case for all types of trials, including especially efficacy trials, in which intervention fidelity data are assiduously collected throughout the study and adjustments in training and even personnel are made to ensure internal validity. The difference between clinical trials and implementation trials is that in the latter such modifications are planned for a priori and are often the focus of specific study hypotheses, under the rubric of "formative evaluation" (Stetler et al., 2006; see also Elwy, this issue).
lhkq | Thus, in overly simplistic terms, the clinical researcher establishes the efficacy and then effectiveness of an innovation, and then hands it off to the implementation scientist to test ways of getting people to use it. This process as stated is overly simplistic because it suggests a uni- dimensional flow of tasks (like our pipeline in Fig. 1). In reality the process is much more iterative as implementation experience may suggest changes in the clinical innovation to increase its external
82ju | validity (while also taking steps to ensure fidelity to its core compo- nents, supporting internal validity).
y2qo | 4.2. Implementation science versus quality improvement and dissemination research
1piq | Implementation science also differs from quality improvement, which usually begins with a specific problem rather than a practice to promulgate. It typically focuses on an individual clinic, hospital, or system, and tends not to seek to contribute generalizable knowledge (Johnson and Sollecito, 2018). It also differs from traditional dis- semination research, which usually focuses on spread of information using communication and education strategies (Dearing et al., 2018). However, the purpose and methods of these three fields often overlap, as you will see in the articles that follow in this issue.
7fqw | 4.3. The scope of implementation science
rhaz | Thus, not surprisingly, implementation science involves investiga- tion at more levels than just the individual patient/subject. Targets of investigation may also include the provider, clinic, facility, organiza- tion, community, and even the policy environment (Damschroder et al., 2009; Harvey and Kitson, 2016).
wak1 | Thus, also not surprisingly given the central role of context in im- plementation science, implementation researchers include not just clinicians and clinical scientists but also social scientists, economists, systems engineers and health services researchers. Additionally, special mention should be made of the relationship between implementation researchers and their "operational partners" with whom a clinical in- novation is to be deployed: healthcare system leaders, administrators, and staff who run and staff the clinics, facilities, and organizations (and sometimes also including policymakers). Unlike clinical research, in which such individuals and structures play a primarily permissive or
wtfz | passively supportive role, in implementation research operational col- leagues need to be full partners in the research from study design through analysis, since implementation research aims to assess and actively intervene in their structures, where they are the experts. While there are cultural gaps between researchers and healthcare system leaders and staff that must be overcome (Kilbourne et al., 2012; Bauer et al., 2016), their participation is essential since an innovation will be implemented because of them, not in spite of them.
qy1i | 4.4. Summary
1k9e | In summary, implementation science seeks to "continue the job" of biomedical research, taking evidence-based clinical innovations and testing strategies to move them into wider practice. Given this goal, the principles and methods of implementation science differ somewhat from clinical research. Most centrally, implementation science proto- cols do not ignore or control for context, but rather actively seek to intervene to change the context in which clinical innovations are used in order to enhance their uptake. Importantly, implementation scien- tists interface closely with healthcare leaders and staff as partners, breaking down the research-practice divide in order to achieve the ul- timate goal of increasing the public health impact of evidence-based innovations.
5bjs | A number of exciting challenges face the rapidly developing field of implementation science. First and foremost, further integration of im- plementation science methodologies into clinical trial designs will speed the development of evidence-based interventions that have de- monstrable public health impact.
uodj | In addition, development of efficient methodologies for data col- lection with minimal disruption to the processes under study will be important in order to minimize the Hawthorne effect in both descriptive studies and controlled trials. Testing and validating the theories that underlie implementation efforts is needed to enhance the development of next-generation analytic methods and interventions. Finally, the development of an investigator workforce with diverse and com- plementary skills, and provision of sustainable academic careers for them, remains a central challenge to the field (see Chambers, this issue).
k16v | 5. Conclusion: overview of this special issue
b2lm | This Special Issue is designed to serve as an introduction to the principles, concepts, and methods of implementation science. The ar- ticles have been written particularly for clinical scientists interested in how to increase the public health impact of their work.
ti7f | The Special issue provides articles on topics in two general areas, the first is those that are foundational to implementation science such as the conceptual background and specific methodologies that are core to this field of study. The second area are a set of articless that address special and emerging topics within implementation science including an expansion of case study analysis through a matrix process, the ap- plication of implementation science in gloabal settings and capacity- building and training opportunities. Each of the manuscripts includes a review of underlying principles, introduction to relevant methods, and an example from a real-world, funded study that illustrates and am- plifies the principles and methods discussed:
