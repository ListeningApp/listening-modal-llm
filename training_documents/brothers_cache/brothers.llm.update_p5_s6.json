Although people participate in the wars as soldiers and supporters, they are also quick to blame it on political leaders who have fanned the animosity. In this manner, physical borders and boundaries of identity at a local level may be conceived differently from state borders and expressions of formal nationalism at inter-state level. As this article demonstrates, the local level border between Eritrea and Ethiopia has become increasingly more porous, while the inter-state border was rigidly defended. Likewise, shared experiences and common interests among the borderland populations on both sides, started grassroots processes of reconnecting social and identity formations across the inflexible inter-state border. The focus of this article will thus be on observations of shared sentiments of people-to-people reconciliation and commonalities between the Tigrinya-speaking border populations of Eritrean and Ethiopia, contextualised by the nascent bilateral rapprochement. Before that however, a brief overview of the 'active' and 'cold' war will be presented, as well as the political peace\nxxr8 | rapprochement taken by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed after he came to power in April twenty eighteen. First, however, some comments on the methodological limitations to the study.\nrl4j | 'Balancing the border': methodological limitations\nvz32 | This article is based on almost thirty years of research on Eritrean-Ethiopian relations, starting with long-term anthropological fieldwork in a small village of highland Eritrea at the tail-end of the liberation war (nineteen ninety-one to ninety-three), field visits to Eritrea and Tigray in the interim-period of peace (nineteen ninety-three to ninety-seven), and long-term fieldwork in Tigray during the nineteen ninety-eight to two thousand war. Since then, I have conducted field visits and research work in Ethiopia several times a year, leading up to a twenty-seventeen research project with colleagues from Mekelle University on people-to-people reconciliation in the borderlands. I also carried out field work in the Ethiopian borderlands in Tigray between twenty-seventeen and twenty-nineteen.\nncb0 | Independent critical research is not permitted in Eritrea. Regrettably, I, as well as many other scholars on Eritrea, have been denied entry to the country since the nineteen ninety-eight to two thousand war. To address this imbalance in empirical data gathering, I have made field visits to Eritrean refugee camps in east Sudan and Tigray. I have also, over two decades, maintained close communication with Eritrean academics, political and human rights representatives, and other refugees in the diaspora. In addition, to canvas the greatest range of personal observations from those affected by the war, I made several field visits to the Ethiopian border town of Zalambessa and its environs. I also crossed the border to visit an Eritrean village caught between the Eritrean trenches and the Ethiopian border, but under military control by Ethiopian defence forces. Eritrean and Tigrayan respondents were generally selected randomly during these field visits. Some, however, were recommended by other Eritreans or Tigrayans.\n8mp0 | Fieldwork in border zones may prove challenging as one traverses different political realms. When borderlands are militarised, political and security concerns potentially limit the researcher's operational capability. They may also restrict informants' willingness and ability to talk and comment on sensitive issues. My longitudinal studies of Eritrean-Ethiopian relations, as well as my frequent field visits during almost three decades, however, mitigate these methodological limitations.\nxjyk | The nineteen ninety-eight to two thousand war\nmt0f | The nineteen ninety-eight to two thousand Eritrean-Ethiopian war was ostensibly fought over a sliver of land, but its root causes were anchored in disputes over history, ideology, economy, and identity. Two sister movements - Eritrean People's Liberation Front and Tigrayan People's Liberation Front - toppled the Derg military junta in\nawab | Ethiopia in May nineteen ninety-one. Whilst Eritrean People's Liberation Front formed an independent government in liberated Eritrea, Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, through its coalition party, Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front, assumed power in Addis Ababa. The close relationship demonstrated on the battlefields in northern Ethiopia during the nineteen seventies and nineteen eighties soon soured, however, as economic and political competition turned into a hegemonic struggle for dominance in the Horn of Africa. Small-scale border disputes erupted in the mid-nineteen nineties, as the trust between the two leaderships began to wane. The introduction of the new Eritrean currency in October nineteen ninety-seven and subsequent formalisation of trade between the two countries, put focus for the first time on where the actual border should be demarcated on the ground, as customs and immigration facilities needed to be established.\nixcc | In early May nineteen ninety-eight, a small border skirmish in Badme, a Western plains village in Ethiopian-administered territory close to the Sudanese border, rapidly escalated into a full-scale bilateral war, as Eritrean forces penetrated deep into areas previously controlled by Ethiopia. The Eritrean surprise attack led to the remobilisation of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front's guerrilla army by the regional government to defend Tigrayan inhabitants and territory, as well as the federal army to defend the motherland and its sovereignty.\n8p6h | As the conflict escalated the international community scrambled to negotiate the conflict. It soon became clear, however, that both Ethiopia and Eritrea knew this conflict would be settled on the battlefield, and not around the negotiation table. Ethiopian counter-offensives, first to retake Badme in March nineteen ninety-nine, and later in May two thousand on the Tsorona, Zalambessa and Assab fronts, led to devastating losses. The entrenched Eritrean positions were attacked head on by waves of Ethiopian foot soldiers. Tens of thousands of young men perished on the plains of Badme and hillsides of Tsorona. When the Ethiopian military command leadership later assessed the terrible details and losses on the Tsorona front, they reportedly all broke down crying.\npmgl | During the spring offensive of two thousand, Ethiopia managed finally to break through the Eritrean defence lines on the Western and Central front lines. The Eritrean government ordered a strategic retreat. At the same time they communicated acceptance of a negotiated settlement and cease fire agreement. Although parts of the Ethiopian military and political leadership wanted to continue the offensive towards Asmara, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi ordered a halt in military operations and indicated a willingness to negotiate. Total Ethiopian losses amounted to close to one hundred thousand killed and two hundred thousand wounded, while Eritrea officially lost nineteen thousand. My personal communications with former high ranking members of the Eritrean armed forces indicates that the number might be twice as high.\n90no | The Algiers peace agreement\n```\n",
