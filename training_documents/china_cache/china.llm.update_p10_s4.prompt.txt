You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

wak1 | Nonetheless, there were increased tensions between Hong Kong and Britain. The devaluation of the pound in 1967 had drastically affected public confidence in the British government. To add fuel to the fire, Britain's entry into the European Economic Community curtailed Hong Kong's textile exports to the British Isles under more restric- tive quotas. London also increased Hong Kong's contribution to the maintenance of the British garrison from 29 per cent in 1970 to 75 per cent in 1978.83 On the other hand, the 1967 riots had already demonstrated the significance of the 'China factor': a surge in Chinese nationalism could lead to violence and chaos, shattering political stability. Nationalism did not diminish but flourished in the early 1970s, which could be observed from the emergence of patriotic social movements, such as the Chinese Language Campaign and the Senkaku Islands Movement. Given the uncertainty imposed by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the death of Mao and the fall of the Gang of Four after 1976, the state had to observe changing perceptions towards China. In this context, it was vital for the state to be fully informed of changing political attitudes and identities so that it could measure the success of its community-building project, continue fostering a sense of belonging among the community, and avoid any anti-colonial or British senti- ments being exploited and turned into disturbances.
wtfz | Attitudes towards colonial rule
qy1i | The political culture in Hong Kong experienced changes in the 1970s. Hong Kong Chinese used to be 'very cautious about saying anything adverse about the government in public'. Most complaints in newspapers tended to be anonymous.84 According to MOOD, such political inactivity could be explained by 'the persisting fatalism inherited from traditional attitudes formed by experience under successive Chinese governments', which discouraged people from contesting colonial policies and questioning misdeeds of the state.85 The perception that politics was dangerous and that ordinary people lacked capabilities to comprehend it could be found in a number of Cantonese proverbs, such as 'officials have two mouths' (a traditional saying which means that authorities could always find an excuse to justify their decisions), 'the poor should never attempt to fight the wealthy, or the wealthy to fight officialdom', and 'the governor of a prefecture can commit arson with impurity, but the people are not even allowed to light their lamps'.86 This attunes to the claims of scholars such as Lau Siu-kai, Kuan Hsin-chi, J. Stephen Hoadley, and Norman Miners, who asserted that administrative power was the preroga- tive of rulers in the history of China.87 However, when compared to the 1950s, the public in the mid-1970s was 'much more prone to take issue with the government over what they consider[ed] to be unjust official action, believing that the incompetent, corrupt, or unfair officer should not, and will not, get away with his wrongdoings, in the face of
1k9e | public exposure'.88 Knowing that the state was unlikely to suppress and arrest them, the grass-roots members of society started to 'speak up or stage protest action(s)'.89
5bjs | According to MOOD, popular political participation was the outcome of social devel- opment, emerging problems and challenges, and new policy responses to them.90 After the 1967 riots, the City District Officer Scheme was introduced to close the communica- tion gap between the people and the government. Policies were publicized and explained to the public. Campaigns, such as 'Clean Hong Kong' and 'Fight Violent Crime', were launched to build up a positive image of the state. The Governor and high-ranked civil servants appeared in public more frequently to discuss policies and problems. People's confidence towards the government grew due to its responsiveness to public opinion in the Chinese Language Movement, the Godber affair, and the setting up of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in the first half of the 1970s: 'many more people feel that the government is prepared to take a fair and honest attitude about its own failings and shortcomings'.91 As a result, not only was there an increase in public engagement in current affairs 'at all levels of society', but 'the traditional fear of authority or official- dom' had been 'greatly reduced'.92
uodj | Nonetheless, respondents still found the state's services and documents 'slow, time- consuming and complicated, difficult to understand', especially the colonial laws. While finding the staff in the City District Council 'largely unhelpful', they also believed that the high-ranked civil servants were 'adopting a rigid and unimaginative approach' in solving problems.93 The shift in political culture was not profound. Uneducated low- income earners were 'less aware of the essence of implications of the new style of open government'. Many still believed that the state was 'almighty' and only governed accord- ing to its interests. They remained 'largely indifferent to how Hong Kong [was] gov- erned' as long as their lives were not affected.94 The working class paid little attention to issues outside their daily livelihood: 'subjects like the future of Hong Kong [were] too remote, and too much above them, to be of much interest'.95 It was also observed that there was 'no general public aspiration or pressure for constitutional reform' and ordi- nary people 'at large, [were] not interested in the mechanism or constitutional set-up of government'. According to MOOD, 'majority attitudes indicate a lack of enthusiasm about elections'.96
k16v | Shift of political culture led to tensions between the generations. Among the middle- aged and elderly, the period did not witness 'the creation of a new political and social climate'.97 Political conservatism persisted. To avoid 'rocking the boat', many of them advocated 'a style of "strong government" which should refrain from 'becoming too accommodating towards rabble-rousers'.98 The upper and middle classes were also 'staunch supporters of the status quo'.99 Many of them viewed political activism 'with dislike and concern' as they were worried that 'social order and discipline will inevitably be undermined' and perceived these informal means of political engagement as 'undigni- fied and unbecoming of their status'.100 Although they often supported the state's policies publicly, in private, many expressed concerns over the increasingly 'liberal or accom- modating' governing style, which they thought would 'give rise to escalating public aspi- rations' that were impossible to meet.101 The wealthy strata within the middle-aged and elderly groups conformed closest to Lau's description of 'utilitarianistic familism'.102 Rather than having strong emotional attachment to the colony, they stayed only because
b2lm | 'living in Hong Kong offers many attractions'. The 'outward-looking' economy and its rising international status provided these people who possessed 'capital and entrepreneur qualities' with 'first class opportunities'. They could 'enjoy their wealth more cheaply, safely and freely' in the colony because of the low tax rate and social stability. Being in an 'overwhelming Chinese society', they had a higher social status through business and adopted the Chinese way of life while enjoying 'the full benefits of living in a cosmo- politan city'.103 Most of the professionals and middle-scale proprietors supported the existing social order because of instrumental concerns: 'they have by large succeeded in going some way up the social ladder, often through hard work and preserving effort, and do not wish to lose that position'.104
ti7f | The young generation held 'significantly different, and largely less favourable, views of the government than their elders'.105 Many of them found the paternalistic type of government intolerable. MOOD predicted that some of them were going to demand more political participation and increased consultation, and become 'even more aggressive and presumptuous' towards the colonial government.106 Radicals among students argued that 'the government has become more enlightened and accommodating because it can see very well that there is no alternative'.107
