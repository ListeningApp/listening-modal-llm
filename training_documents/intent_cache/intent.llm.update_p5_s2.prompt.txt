You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

4xe7 | As shown, the occupational therapist employs several therapeutic strategies, usually rooted in existing models of practice, to facilitate the client's engagement in occupation. Depending on the occupational needs, capacities, and di- agnosis of the client, any number of occupational therapy practice models might be employed alone or in combina- tion to promote occupational engagement. However, this main task of promoting occupational engagement through employing the specific methods and strategies of occupa- tional therapy does not exist in isolation of a larger process of relating that occurs between client and therapist.
pg4b | The IRM explains the relationship between client and therapist that is part of the overall process of occu- pational therapy. Accordingly, the model is intended to complement existing occupational therapy conceptual practice models rather than to replace any single model. It explains the detailed and overarching aspects of the client-therapist relationship, an aspect of occupational therapy not addressed by other practice models in as much detail or as the sole focus. Figure 3.3 shows how the intentional relationship is designed to supplement the use of other occupational therapy conceptual practice models. As shown, the IRM should complement the usual concepts and strategies of occupational therapy that are directly aimed at facilitating occupational engagement.
b0d0 | The model's utility for occupational therapy lies in addressing the otherwise unarticulated aspects of the
d7eu | Occupation
xndr | Existing Occupational Therapy Models (e.g., Biomechanical, Cognitive Disabilities, Model of Human Occupation,
m6hi | Sensory Integration Model, etc.)
vpkf | interpersonal relationship that occur during the therapy process and that influence both occupational engagement and therapy outcomes. If a therapist utilized only this model, the essential work of occupational therapy would not occur. Instead, the model was designed to fill a gap in our practical knowledge about how to manage the interper- sonal aspects of therapy, particularly the more challenging ones. This model should complement the field's existing methods and models by making the process of establish- ing a successful relationship with clients easier, clearer, and more straightforward. The next section defines the ele- ments of this model and provides an explanation of how the elements interact to optimize the circumstances for a suc- cessful client-therapist relationship in occupational therapy.
4d67 | Elements of the Intentional Relationship Model
e7j2 | The IRM views the therapeutic relationship as being comprised of four central elements.
lqzt | 1. The client's interpersonal characteristics
1ocm | 2. The inevitable interpersonal events that occur during therapy
527v | 3. The therapist's use of self (i.e., mode use, interpersonal skill base, and ability to apply interpersonal reasoning)
lrri | 4. Occupational engagement, which is viewed as the mechanism of change
5cl9 | A summary diagram of the model is presented in Figure 3.4. The model explains the requirements for a productive client-therapist relationship. It incorporates guidelines for responding to each client's unique interpersonal char- acteristics and to the interpersonal events that commonly occur during therapy. The relevant aspects of each ele- ment of the model and their relations with one another are described in the section that follows.
u7a3 | The Client's Interpersonal Characteristics
w409 | According to the IRM, achieving an empathic understand- ing of the client is the focal point of effective use of self
m04y | (rather than the client's) to develop a working and predict- able communication with the client and to respond appro- priately when interpersonal events occur. To develop this relationship and respond appropriately to the client, a ther- apist must work to understand the client from an interper- sonal perspective. This involves getting to know the client as an interpersonal being. The IRM calls for us to understand the most salient interpersonal characteristics of our clients as they present themselves during occupational therapy.
23jk | The IRM asks us to strive to know our clients' inter- personal characteristics and behaviors within 14 catego- ries. The most critical aspect of understanding our clients as interpersonal beings involves a therapist's recognition of characteristics that make it more challenging to com-
oa63 | A client's lips are pursed and her shoulders are tight when she recol-
e3lv | lects a conflict that occurred with her daughter just before the accident.
rqv6 | A client is cold and would be more comfortable if she had her sweater, which she left in another room. She shivers through the rest of the ses- sion because she does not want to impose on or interrupt the therapist.
oa48 | 14 categories of interpersonal characteristics. Each cate- gory may be a product of the situation (i.e., situational) or a more stable interpersonal style (enduing). Each char- acteristic is accompanied by an example of what would indicate a need for closer attention from the therapist.
3fp1 | Our understanding of each of these characteristics should not be approached from a strengths versus liabili- ties perspective; the IRM is not interested in stigmatizing or pathologizing clients. Instead, the IRM calls for us to understand the interpersonal characteristics of our clients that may be most salient in terms of facilitating or inter- fering with the client's ability to do one or both of the following:
557x | Effectively communicate and relate to the therapist
ep8e | Engage in whatever occupation is the focus of therapy
7mv3 | According to the IRM, each of these 14 interper- sonal characteristics may also be understood along two dimensions:
der6 | Situational
8xg2 | Enduring
njvp | Situational Interpersonal Characteristics
s8b5 | When one or more of the 14 client interpersonal char- acteristics referenced in the preceding paragraph is de- scribed as situational, it means that the characteristic is generally inconsistent with how a client typically and con- sistently behaves when interacting with others. Instead, a situational characteristic reflects a client's acute behavior or reaction to a specific situation. Situational character- istics that interfere with communication or occupational engagement are most likely to reveal themselves when the client is facing a situation where some immediate aspect of the impairment or the environment is experienced as painful, frustrating, or stressful. Impairments, particularly when they are new or when there is a medical crisis or exacerbation in severity that disrupts one's usual routines or relationships, often cause people to experience stress. Therapists are encouraged to assume, on some level, that a client's impairment situation or the client's interaction with an unaccommodating or difficult environment causes the client to be more vulnerable to experiencing a variety of reactions, many of which may be perceived as negative or at least atypical for that individual.
p450 | PRACTICAL APPLICATION 3.1
rsvo | Feelings of loss are common among newly disabled individuals, and they may manifest in terms of sadness, irritability, anxiety, insecurity, or anger. A health provider's interpersonal behavior, if perceived as insensitive, judg- mental, or uncaring, may also serve as a source of stress and cause the client to interact in a manner that is gener- ally inconsistent with his or her usual way of relating. It is important for new therapists to recognize that these and other acute emotional reactions are normative. In fact, they are "givens" in many health-care situations. They may bear no reflection on the client's character. However, they do have the potential to play out within the therapy relationship, and the way in which a therapist chooses to respond to them is often vital to the future of that relationship (Fig. 3.5).
z4m8 | Enduring Interpersonal Characteristics
ukf0 | By contrast, enduring characteristics are more stable and consistent aspects of the client's interpersonal behavior. Unlike a situational characteristic, enduring character- istics are not necessarily related to the situation of ac- quiring an impairment, an acute reaction during a brief moment of distress, or to problems in the environment, such as the lack of appropriate accommodations. Instead,
