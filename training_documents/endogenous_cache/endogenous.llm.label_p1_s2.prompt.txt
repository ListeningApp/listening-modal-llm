You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1pjs | 1 Dysregulation of neuroproteasomes by ApoE isoforms drives endogenous Tau aggregation
o2kr | 14
v6sk | 19
1wj6 | 23
936l | 24 Neuroproteasomes are a subset of 20S proteasomes that are localized to the neuronal plasma
06yq | 25 membrane and degrade newly synthesized proteins. To date, the molecular composition of
dpv6 | 26 neuroproteasomes is undefined, and moreover, whether neuroproteasomes can influence protein
8r5j | 27 aggregation with relevance to neurodegenerative disorders remains unexplored. Using a Cre-
2taz | 28 dependent conditional knock-in mouse line to endogenously tag the proteasome, we find that
o3ya | 29 neuroproteasomes co-purify with ApoE, the most significant risk factor for late-onset
r5il | 30 Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We discover that neuroproteasome membrane localization is
5gui | 31 differentially modulated by ApoE isoforms (E4<E3<E2) in vitro, in vivo, and in human 32 postmortem samples. We synthesized selective, neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors and
82qc | 33 discovered that neuroproteasome inhibition induces aggregation of endogenous mouse and
ls7d | 34 human Tau, without the need for seeding or pathogenic mutations. Using hApoE-KI/hTau-KI
tzt3 | 35 crosses, we find that ApoE isoforms differentially shift the aggregation threshold for Tau.
t8vv | 36 Neuroproteasome inhibition in vivo is sufficient to induce sarkosyl-insoluble and Thioflavin-S
qvnu | 37 positive endogenous Tau aggregates in only three days, which are completely abrogated by co-
kggw | 38 application of cycloheximide. Newly synthesized Tau levels increase threefold after
xrd1 | 39 neuroproteasome inhibition, leading us to posit that newly synthesized Tau is uniquely
5746 | 40 susceptible to aggregation due to neuroproteasome dysfunction. Overall, our data define
7toz | 41 neuroproteasomes as a pivotal proteostasis mechanism underlying the formation of endogenous
j346 | 42 Tau aggregates, which is directly regulated by the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset
v8uq | 43 Alzheimer's Disease.
x972 | 44 Introduction
cwrw | 45
4i0e | 46 Protein homeostasis mechanisms define the cellular capacity to handle protein synthesis, folding,
h2l3 | 47 and clearance while minimizing the accumulation of deleterious protein misfolding and
dfzb | 48 aggregation events. While many factors contribute to protein homeostasis, protein degradation
u6ty | 49 serves as a critical and non-redundant determinant of cellular proteostatic capacity. In canonical
awvu | 50 models of protein degradation, proteins are either degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system
on9b | 51 or the endo-lysosomal and autophagic systems(1, 2). In contrast to the established paradigms of
a8ge | 52 protein degradation, we recently described the neuroproteasome, which is localized to the
h27a | 53 neuronal plasma membrane, exposed to the extracellular space, and degrades intracellular
pdjh | 54 substrates across the membrane(3). We interpret this to mean that the neuroproteasome is
xmgs | 55 functionally transmembrane(3). In addition, neuroproteasomes are composed of the 20S core
bd9h | 56 proteasome and lack the canonical 19S cap and therefore, cannot recognize ubiquitylated
m047 | 57 substrates or unfold them for degradation. Instead, neuroproteasomes co- or peri-translationally
gy8c | 58 degrade newly synthesized proteins without the need for ubiquitylation(4). While multiple
y4mj | 59 reports have demonstrated the existence of neuroproteasomes in diverse systems(5), the
vpgq | 60 molecular composition of neuroproteasomes, the regulation underlying neuroproteasome
ousl | 61 membrane localization, and the function of neuroproteasomes in vivo are poorly defined. 62
m4ju | 63 Failures in protein homeostasis are linked to accumulation of protein inclusions and aggregates.
a0mb | 64 Indeed, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and many other neurodegenerative diseases are linked by the
ki8m | 65 accumulation of protein aggregates(6, 7). Tau aggregates are among the most common
km8w | 66 intracellular aggregates in AD and are characteristic of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases,
wzno | 67 termed Tauopathies(8). Multiple mutations that render Tau more prone to aggregation have been
xagm | 68 identified in patients(9) and these have been extensively modeled in transgenic lines and iPSC-
iwn5 | 69 derived neurons(10-13). While these studies have provided important insights into the
uooz | 70 mechanisms of Tau aggregate clearance, genetic variants in MAPT only make up less than 5% of
pxbq | 71 the total population with AD and Tauopathies(14-18). Instead, endogenous Tau aggregates are
jfsr | 72 found in the absence of overexpression or mutations in MAPT in the majority of patients with
u15r | 73 sporadic AD(19, 20). The protein quality control mechanisms in neurons that prevent
lq35 | 74 endogenous Tau from aggregating remain elusive.
3g9w | 75
d09o | 76 Moreover, aggregated Tau can induce the further aggregation of otherwise normal Tau, creating
ylhz | 77 a feed-forward prion-like propagation referred to as Tau seeding(12, 21, 22). Studies delineating
a3td | 78 the principles of Tau seeding and propagation have provided new insights into the development
ex5k | 79 of Tau pathology. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the initial aggregate formation in this
9d4o | 80 pathological context are unclear. Therefore, identifying mechanisms by which endogenous Tau
cjq2 | 81 aggregates form could provide a unique therapeutic opportunity for intervention before Tau
5esx | 82 seeds can promote further templating and propagation.
m5ka | 83
byu8 | 84 While failures of the endolysosomal and autophagic systems can exacerbate Tau aggregation(23-
76b0 | 85 26), whether and how proteasomal dysfunction affects Tau aggregation is contested. Multiple
zxz6 | 86 reports demonstrate that proteasomes can degrade Tau in vitro and in heterologous cells (27-30).
xnth | 87 However, follow up studies demonstrated that proteasome inhibition in neurons neither increases
vafm | 88 Tau levels nor does it induce endogenous Tau aggregation(31-34). In fact, somewhat
2zmw | 89 counterintuitively, proteasomal inhibition leads to the reduction of soluble Tau due to the
bf9k | 90 compensatory induction of autophagy in neurons(31-34). However, proteasomes can be involved
otkr | 91 in clearing already aggregated Tau but require the help of ATPases such as VCP to unfold the
ibgs | 92 aggregates(35). The mechanisms by which protein degradation machineries determine both the
colo | 93 formation and clearance of endogenous Tau aggregates are still debated. The discovery of the
d6r4 | 94 neuroproteasome provides a new mechanism to interrogate how protein degradation could
9mrz | 95 contribute to the formation and clearance of protein aggregates in neurons.
pk06 | 96
7wn9 | 97 While the precise mechanisms underlying Tau aggregation remain a subject of intense
wcd0 | 98 investigation, one major genetic factor that influences Tau aggregation and many other
caos | 99 phenotypes in neurodegeneration is ApoE(36-38). The most significant risk factor for sporadic 100 Alzheimer's Disease is the ApoE4 isoform of the ApoE gene, while the ApoE3 isoform is neutral
qrvy | 101 and the ApoE2 isoform is protective(39, 40). The mechanisms by which ApoE isoforms confer
pn9j | 102 dramatic differences in the risk for AD remains unclear, but it is well established that ApoE4 is
1pmc | 103 associated with increased Amyloid ß and Tau pathology(37, 41, 42). More specifically, it
5z6q | 104 remains mechanistically vague how ApoE isoforms influence Tau aggregation and
yeoh | 105 neurodegeneration. Gaining the biochemical and cell biological insights connecting ApoE
b8hf | 106 isoforms and Tau turnover could be invaluable to revealing the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.
hntf | 107
99fo | 108
y5r7 | 109 Here, we discover an unexpected link between ApoE and endogenous Tau aggregation through
lrry | 110 the neuroproteasome. Using a transgenic mouse line to endogenously and conditionally tag the
hvhm | 111 20S proteasome coupled with quantitative proteomics, we found that neuroproteasomes co-
863b | 112 purify with ApoE. Neuroproteasome localization at the plasma membrane is differentially
fj24 | 113 regulated by ApoE isoforms, with ApoE4 reducing localization and ApoE2 increasing
uz3c | 114 localization relative to ApoE3, in vivo, in primary neurons, and in humans. Using an unbiased
d5bi | 115 quantitative proteomic screen, we identify neuronal responses to neuroproteasome inhibition in
ba4l | 116 the soluble and insoluble proteome. Neuroproteasome dysfunction leads to deficits in
ffx8 | 117 proteostasis and induces aggregation of endogenous Tau in primary neurons and in vivo. We find
s6su | 118 that ApoE4 reduces the threshold at which Tau aggregates by ~ 25-fold compared to ApoE3 and
y219 | 119 ~200-fold compared to ApoE2, thereby dramatically elevating risk for Tau aggregation due to
06ht | 120 neuroproteasome dysfunction. Neuroproteasome-inhibition-induced endogenous Tau inclusions
v3r2 | 121 migrate as a high molecular weight species, which is typically reported only in the AD brain or
nv42 | 122 with seeding-competent Tau(43-46). Using quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis supported by
xags | 123 imaging in primary neurons and in vivo, we find that neuroproteasome inhibition induces the
jc47 | 124 phosphorylation of Tau at sites consistent with pathological aggregated Tau in the AD brain. We suggest that neuroproteasomes serve as a pivotal proteostasis factor, mechanistically distinct from canonical degradation systems, directly linking ApoE to the formation of endogenous Tau aggregates.

mn1r | 133
5vqw | 134 We sought to purify the neuroproteasome directly out of the mouse brain. Our attempts to do this out of wild-type (WT) tissue proved challenging due to lengthy preparations which caused low
meyw | 135
2e62 | 136 yields. To circumvent this, we built a transgenic mouse line to endogenously tag the 20S
75y3 | 137 proteasome for affinity purification. The proteasome is comprised of the 20S catalytic core
s2g2 | 138 particle which, as part of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation system, can be terminally
q1q2 | 139 associated with either one or two 19S regulatory particles, referred to as the 26S (20S+19S) or 140 30S <LATEX>\left( 2 0 S + t w o \quad 1 9 S \right)</LATEX> proteasome respectively. The 20S core is characterized by four axially 141 stacked heptameric rings: the outer alpha subunit rings which gate substrate entry and the inner
cb7r | 142 rings which contain the catalytic beta subunits. The 19S caps contain subunits to bind
68xu | 143 ubiquitylated substrates and ATPases to unfold said substrates into the 20S core. Therefore,
hd35 | 144 modifying the 20S with affinity tags allows us to isolate any complex containing the core
2zpk | 145 proteasome, such as free 20S, singly-capped 26S, doubly-capped 30S proteasomes, or the
epu7 | 146 neuroproteasome. We modified the C-termini of nearly every core proteasome subunit with
7od1 | 147 either 6X-His or Strep-II tags and screened out constructs based on low expression and
0bqy | 148 interference with proteasome function (Fig S1A). Of the remaining two constructs, we found that
b780 | 149 only the C-terminal modification of Psma3 was compatible with proper proteasome assembly
ccmb | 150 and function and did not adversely affect cell health (Fig S1B). Based on these data, we
ma93 | 15: generated a 20S-FLAG transgenic line by adding flanking loxP sites surrounding the final exon
c6hh | 152 (Exon 11) of the Psma3 gene followed by the same sequence with a linker containing a 3X-
y7ea | 153 FLAG tag (Fig 1A). By crossing 20S-FLAG transgenic mice with a line expressing Cre
nav4 | 154 recombinase driven by the pan-neuronal Actlb6 (BAF53b) promoter(47), we generated mice that
gem8 | 155 expressed FLAG-tagged proteasomes selectively in neurons (Fig 1B). Brains from 20S-
e8nr | 156 FLAG/BAF53b-Cre mice and Cre-only littermate controls were processed and FLAG-tagged
k78w | 157 cytosolic proteasomes were isolated on beads with a nanobody against the FLAG epitope.
g9du | 158 Simultaneously, 26S proteasomes were isolated using the GST-UBL affinity isolation
f682 | 160 <LATEX>\mathrm { m e t h o d } \left( 4 8 \right)</LATEX> and all samples were immunoblotted using antibodies raised against multiple 19S
li1k | 159
pbea | 161 and 20S subunits. We find that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the proteasome and we fail to detect any FLAG in the Cre-only littermate controls (Fig 1B).
ccpt | 162
0fpw | 163 We next measured the catalytic activity of the FLAG-tagged proteasome compared to
dqn8 | 164 unmodified proteasomes by monitoring the cleavage of a model substrate, Suc-LLVY-AMC(49).
cop0 | 165 An increase in fluorescence reflects the proteasome-dependent cleavage of this LLVY substrate
lhkq | 166 which mobilizes the free fluorescence of AMC. We find that the catalytic activity of isolated 26S
82ju | 167 proteasomes from mice expressing 20S-FLAG are indistinguishable from the unmodified
y2qo | 168 proteasomes isolated from controls (Fig 1C). We find that FLAG affinity purified proteasomes 169 are catalytically identical to 26S affinity purified proteasomes (Fig 1C). We fail to detect FLAG
1piq | 170 expression in the livers from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre mice, nor can we affinity isolate
7fqw | 171 proteasomes using the FLAG epitope handle from the liver, indicative of the selective and
rhaz | 172 173 inducible nature of the 20S-FLAG transgene (Fig S1C, D). Overall, we find that mice expressing 20S-FLAG appear indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. These extensive
wak1 | 174 characterizations support the conclusion that epitope tagging of the 20S with FLAG is inert and
wtfz | 175 does not disrupt native proteasome function.
qy1i | 176
1k9e | 177 To test whether the 20S-FLAG was efficiently incorporated into the neuroproteasome, we
5bjs | 178 performed surface biotinylation experiments out of both primary neurons and hippocampal tissue
uodj | 179 from 20S-FLAG transgenic mice. This is a well-established method for measuring
k16v | 180 neuroproteasome surface localization(3, 50, 51). Hippocampi from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre mice
b2lm | 18: were incubated with a cell-impermeable sulfonylated Biotin-NHS-Ester to label surface-exposed
ti7f | 182 amines and surface proteins were pulled down on streptavidin beads. We observe strong FLAG
oksu | 183 expression in the surface fraction, indicating that the FLAG tag is incorporated into the
wtow | 184 neuroproteasome (Fig 1D). We fail to detect cytosolic proteins such as Actin in our surface
o22k | 185 fraction, validating our surface-labeling approach, and fail to observe FLAG expression in 20S-
nwfz | 186 FLAG mice without Cre (Fig 1D). By blotting using an antibody which detects six of the seven
nvfy | 187 alpha subunits of the 20S proteasome including a7, the subunit coded for by Psma3, we can
mror | 188 clearly distinguish the modified a7 subunit overlaying with the FLAG signal, denoting
zlxc | 189 modification of the endogenous protein (Fig 1D). Next, we used surface biotinylation to assess if
k0bw | 190 our transgenic system was functional in primary cultures. Primary neurons from 20S-FLAG mice
aq5a | 191 were cultured and transduced with AAVs to express Cre recombinase at days in vitro (DIV) two
sc5y | 192 and then processed for surface biotinylation at DIV14 (Fig S1E). We did not detect FLAG
0yab | 193 without AAVs to express Cre, supporting our conclusion that the 20S-FLAG transgene is 194 inducible and not leaky.
w95z | 195
0i1k | 196 Next, we purified FLAG-neuroproteasomes to determine their composition. First, we prepared
dqlg | 197 plasma membranes from 20S-FLAG/Baf53b-Cre brains and then gently extracted membrane
p6pq | 198 proteins. We find our membrane preparations were enriched in membrane proteins such as
zse6 | 199 GluR1 and depleted of cytosolic proteins like Actin (Fig S1F). We affinity isolated FLAG-
