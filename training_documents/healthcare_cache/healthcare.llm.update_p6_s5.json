        "content": "vbni | Health care administrators must support sustainable health care initiatives financially and socially through hospital policies. Governmental structures, including health care programs must be invested in sustainable health care through federal and state regulations, and local policies. Accreditation bodies that manage medical education, building safety, and health care professional licensure need to integrate sustainability into their ethos.\ndgcw | Two. Discomfort with Waste\ngvwz | Physicians and other health care providers are at the terminus of the production chain. As they provide care, they use and dispose of resources. When surveyed, a majority of surgeons and physicians were troubled by the amount of waste they generate. Obstetrician/ gynecologists and ophthalmologists exhibit similar concerns. The concept of moral distress has generally been applied to end-of-life care, but it is also relevant for compulsory participation in unsustainable health care practices. Green initiatives may be an attempt to counteract environmental distress.\nsk5m | Four. Towards Green Health Care Reform\nqws8 | Effective health care reform will require compliance across the board. Health care administrators must support sustainable health care initiatives financially and socially through hospital policies. Governmental structures, including health care programs must be invested in sustainable health care through federal and state regulations, and local policies. Accreditation bodies that manage medical education, building safety, and health care professional licensure need to integrate sustainability into their ethos. These are, by and large, beyond the scope of this paper. Here, the focus will remain on developing areas of consensus for patient and physician participation in sustainability initiatives, since this at once provides a path to, and legitimizes, green health care reform.\n877u | Among patients and physicians participating in green initiatives, there appears to be consensus\nrzhj | around the themes of \"health\" and \"ecology.\" Health - as an umbrella term for the wellbeing and harmony of the body and the planet - emerges as a focus of green initiatives. Both patients and physicians desire good physical health, which includes absence from pollution and climate events. They also seek mental equilibrium by avoiding eco-anxiety and environmental moral distress. Many public health paradigms braid physical, mental, and environmental aspects of well-\nbfax | being into one holistic model. These paradigms can be integrated into broader aspects of health care. Ecology is also an encompassing concept, which includes resource conservation, waste reduction, sustainable care, and carbon management. Both patients and physicians invested in green health care are working to lighten their carbon impact. It is likely that other forms of resource reduction would be considered in US health care as well.\nf2y8 | Green health care reform will require sweeping implementation of sustainability initiatives. Patients and physicians can lobby health care plans and health care insurance companies by highlighting the values of health and ecology. The former can be developed through green health care plans for policyholders and the latter through green health care insurance companies.\no7qm | A. Health and the Green Health Care Plan\nd52l | The most recent statistics on health care coverage in the US show that two thirds of Americans are privately insured. As part of the free market, the American health care system has the potential for great agility as it seeks to entice the individual patient-consumer. Sustainable health care plans can utilize existing frameworks of insurance coverage while respecting the environmental preferences of individual policyholders by, for instance, offering a \"Green\" tier of coverage in addition to Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.\nqlbb | A Green tier health care plan would be a more sustainable choice than current health care insurance\nnhsg | options. For instance, a Green tier health care plan may have a variety of low-carbon procedures to choose from. Preventative care initiatives, such as gym subsidies, would be more generously reimbursed, while extended medications, low-success treatments, or elective procedures may be limited. Green tier health care plans could be similar to the multi-level approach proposed by Tom Beauchamp and James Childress, whereby basic health care plans include \"public health measures and preventive care, primary care, and acute care,\" while minimizing financial burden to the policyholder. While there may be a concern that a Green tier health care plan would be the default offered by parsimonious employers, thus resulting in minimal coverage, sustainable health care plans may not be less expensive than other options.\nhy0l | Indeed, the Green plan could cost more, and a percent of premiums could be put towards ensuring that the health care plan provider is offering the most sustainable option, similar to buying \"carbon offsets\" when one purchases an airline ticket or paying more for a health care plan with more coverage. In the former scenario, the extra cost is voluntarily incurred for the environmental trade-off, or because it is required by law. In the latter, the extra cost is seen as value-added to a necessary service. As with other sustainable, but more expensive options, the individual who chooses the green health care plan would likely feel satisfied knowing that she is making the better environmental choice.\n4jmz | Since health care plan tiers are the voluntary choice of policyholders, the individual would enjoy the apparent \"sacrifice\" they are making in limiting certain high-carbon options, while still being assured of quality, value-driven care. An analogy might be choosing a vegetarian meal at a restaurant. Not everyone will want to \"give up\" meat, but those attuned to health, carbon expenditure, and the moral claims of others will readily make a sustainable choice, and indeed, be distressed if there are not opportunities to express one's environmental values. And, like any health care plan, an individual could switch to a different tier during open enrolment if they wanted more resource intensive options, or pay out of pocket for non-covered services.\nb7cq | Companies would be incentivized to offer Green tier health care plans to make themselves more appealing for employee recruitment. Shrewd health care plans will find inexpensive ways to offer sustainable health care that maintain access to basic health needs in response to patient and doctor demands. Even if a Green tier plan is not offered as part of health care reform, best environmental practices should be incentivized; the green option should be the economical option.\n0b39 | B. Ecology and the Green Insurance Company\nqecd | Governmental regulations which would adopt a comprehensive, legally binding model of sustainable health care - such as the one utilized by the United Kingdom's National Health Service-would likely be rejected by US residents as overly restrictive. However, the health care free market gives great latitude for health care plans (e.g., Blue Cross or United Health Care) to determine which medical treatments and services they will offer based on patient preferences. Moreover, the free market and decentralization permit companies to become more sustainable independently.\n1o7p | A green health care insurance company would be accountable for environmentally sound practices. From fair-exchange coffee, to \"cruelty free\" cosmetics, to locally grown food, more customers are willing to support companies that unite ethics with the product they supply. Each year, a handful of articles call on health care to divest from fossil fuel sources. Sustainable energy and investment in renewable sources are two ways an insurance company can be green. Alternatively, a green insurance company might choose to partner only with health care facilities that are members of organizations which actively participate in sustainability initiatives, such as Practice GreenHealth, Health Care Without Harm, the Healthier Hospitals Initiative, and the Catholic Health Association.\ncp13 | To be sure, insurance companies are dependent on many different supply chains. For instance, pharmaceuticals are known environmental menaces and consistently one of the largest carbon emitters in health care. Requiring environmental accountability from drug companies would be a significant first step for greening insurance companies, with ample data to support the move. Once sustainability measures are in place, insurance companies can brand themselves as green, thus rising as visible leaders in green health care reform.\nbgre | Five. Conclusion",
