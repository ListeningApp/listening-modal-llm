You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

u2cj | I'll state versions of the three laws of thermodynamics in the language we've devel- oped here. But please be aware that my versions are idiosyncratic and will make some people raise their eyebrows. I'm afraid you'll have to go elsewhere, like Reif's book, to learn these laws in their traditional form!
aq9q | We've been maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of one quantity. What if we do two or more? Everything works the same way, but the fundamental relation between temperature, energy and entropy, d(E) = TdS, gets one extra term for each constraint. The resulting equation is a version of the 'First Law of Thermodynamics'.
dc5c | I'll explain the case with one extra constraint. Suppose we've got a measure space X whose points are states of some system. Choose two functions on it. They could be anything, but let's call them energy and volume and write them as E: X -> R and V : X -> R. These terms are favored because thermodynamics arose in part from the study of steam engines, where you've got a cylinder of steam with some energy and some volume. For any probability distribution p: X -> [0, 0), we can write down a formula for its Shannon entropy
9diq | H = - | p(x) In p(x) dx
c10k | and also the expected values
f8yn | (E) = | E(x) dx, (V) = V(x) dx.
ahrs | Let's not worry now about whether these integrals converge.
k7hf | Suppose we only know (E) and (V), and we are trying to choose the 'best' prob- ability distribution p with these expected values. What should we do? Following the principle of maximum entropy, we seek the probability distribution p that maximizes H subject to our constraints on (E) and (V). If we do this, we are led to a Lagrange multipliers problem, much as in the the simpler case of one constraint. But now we need two Lagrange multipliers: let's call them ß and y. We get this equation:
wl64 | dH = Bd(E) + yd(V).
qrks | This is the First Law!
m9te | But this isn't the way physicists usually write it. To get the First Law in its usual form, first let's switch to using Gibbs entropy S = kH, and emphasize the role of energy by solving for d(E):
qpsk | d( E) = ds - 2(v).
sx3l | Then, to simplify the look of this equation, let's introduce variables called temperature and pressure:
zm2g | T = kß' 1 P = B.
ui7p | Now the First Law of Thermodynamics looks like this:
ubys | d(E) = TdS - Pd(V).
hphn | It says that as we move around among probability distributions that maximize entropy subject to constraints on expected energy and volume, the change in expected energy is the sum of two terms:
ves3 | · heat, meaning TdS
h4py | · work, meaning -Pd(V).
p612 | For example, if we have a cylinder of steam with pressure P and we increase its expected volume by a little bit A(V), its expected energy goes down by about PA(V): that's how we understand the minus sign. In this situation the external world has done an amount of work -PA(V) on the cylinder of steam, but most people say the cylinder of steam has done an amount of work PA(V) on the external world.
2ll3 | Here are a few puzzles if you want to dig deeper. In the first two, I ask you to generalize ideas from our earlier work on maximizing entropy subject to a single constraint.
roki | Puzzle 51. Let X = {1, ... , n} and let E, V : X -> R be two functions whose values at i E X we call E; and Vi. Suppose p is a probability distribution maximizing the Shannon entropy H on the surface where
xzvf | (E) = e, (V) = v,
vw6g | and also suppose p1, ... , Pn > 0. Show that at p we have
5ltn | dH = Bd(E) + yd(V)
vqad | for some 3, y E R. (Hint: first do the case where not all the E; are equal and not all the Vi are equal. This guarantees that d(E) and d(V) are nonzero. You can handle the other cases separately.)
2xj0 | Puzzle 52. Under the conditions of Puzzle 51 show that
567t | n exp(-BEi - yVi)
sk0p | Pi
vwq7 | Lexp(-BEi - yVi)
beyn | Puzzle 53. Generalize the results of Puzzles 51 and 52 to the case of any finite number of constraints.
jwlq | Puzzle 54. Generalize the results of Puzzle 53 to the case of a system with a count- able infinity of states, or an arbitrary measure space of states. You will need to add assumptions to ensure that the sums or integrals converge.
f8ht | THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
q2it | Suppose a system has some measure space X of states and at any time t there is a probability distribution p(t) on X.
piqi | We say the second law of thermodynamics holds if t1 ≤ t2 => S(p(t1)) ≤ S(p(t2))
mjsy | This seems to be widely true, yet the conditions under which it holds are subtle and much-argued.
01g9 | The Second Law of Thermodynamics, as commonly stated, says that the entropy of a closed system never decreases. This appears to be a profound fact about our universe. A huge challenge to physics is to understand where this law comes from. Can it be derived from some realistic assumptions? One problem is that the laws of classical mechanics are invariant under time-reversal. Thus, if we evolve probability distributions on some space of states according to these laws, for any probability distribution whose entropy is nondecreasing, there is a time-reversed one whose entropy is nonincreasing.
7cm1 | This is called the problem of the arrow of time: briefly, why does the future look so different from the past? Quantum mechanics makes the problem subtler, but does not provide an easy resolution. The solution may be that we happen to live in a universe a particular solution of the laws of physics-where entropy was very low at the Big Bang, making it easy for entropy to increase after that. But if you get ten physicists in a room and ask them to explain the arrow of time, you are likely to hear ten different opinions. Thus, I will not attempt to resolve it here. For more on that, I recommend this book:
oyk6 | Instead, let's see how the Second Law sheds light on the meaning of temperature. You'll notice that in our course I never talked about systems evolving in time, and I never talked about two systems interacting: always just a single system. Now let's imagine two systems, each in thermal equilibrium, but at possibly different tempera- tures. Say the first has entropy S1, expected energy (E1) and temperature T1. As usual, these are related by
3qp5 | dS1 = d(E1) T1 .
guux | Say the second system works similarly, with
fhkp | dS2 = d(E2) T2 .
ur19 | We can define the total entropy of the two systems by
ytow | S = S1 +S2
ozjl | and the total expected energy by
xux5 | (E)=(E1)+(E2).
53mt | Suppose now that the two systems can exchange energy with each other, but in a slow and gentle way, so we can approximately treat each one as in thermal equilibrium at any moment. If no energy flows in or out of the combined system, the total expected energy is conserved, so d(E) dt .= 0
owo1 | and thus
zz70 | d(E1) dt
slcr | What does the Second Law give us in this situation? It implies
z9at | ds dt ≥ 0 or
7dov | Si + S2 > dS2 dt
znos | dt dS1
bngy | It follows that
xja2 | 1 d(E1) T1 dt + T2 dt 1 d(E2) > 0 or
b9a5 | T1 dt 1 d(E1)
thi8 | T2 dt 1 d(E1) ≥ 0.
entm | We can rewrite this as
knql | - T1 1
