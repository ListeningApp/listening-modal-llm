        "content": "82ju | This study had limitations. First, because the surgical procedure was performed by an experienced surgeon, results may not be extrapolated for the same surgery performed under\ny2qo | different conditions including less experience and longer duration of anesthesia. Second, the twenty-hour interval between blood collection for ex vivo COX activity analysis may have missed some information, such as the exact duration of the COX-2 inhibition by meloxicam. Third, meloxicam was prescribed for only four days postoperatively, whereas dipyrone was prescribed for seven days. The duration of drug administration followed our standard meloxicam protocol for management of postoperative ovariohysterectomy pain in cats and the main objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of dipyrone.\n1piq | Conclusion\n7fqw | In the present study, dipyrone (twelve point five and twenty-five milligrams per kilogram for seven days) and meloxicam (zero point one milligrams per kilogram for four days) were administered after ovariohysterectomy in cats. The results indicated adequate analgesia provided by all protocols and that both dipyrone regimens were equally effective. Unexpectedly, both dipyrone doses strongly inhibited COX-1 and COX-2. Laboratory tests of CBC and hepatic and renal function were unchanged and no significant adverse effects were observed. Further trials are indicated to study the mechanism of action of dipyrone and the anti-inflammatory effect of this drug.\nrhaz | Effect of dipyrone on cyclooxygenases in cats MAA Pereira et al.\nwak1 | Authors' contributions\nwtfz | MAAP: study design, data management and interpretation, statistical analysis, preparation of the manuscript.
