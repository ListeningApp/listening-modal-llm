Literature suggests that water may ascend towards the production well under these conditions, making seasonal storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems challenging.\nsk5m | While the hydrogen density and thus the compressibility in the depth range of underground hydrogen storage systems mainly increases with increasing pressure, the dynamic viscosity increases significantly with increasing temperature. In the range of standard conditions up to pressures of fifty megapascals and temperatures of fifty degrees Celsius, the viscosity shows a comparable temperature and pressure dependence. For example, hydrogen viscosity increases by about fifteen percent from standard temperature and pressure conditions to an elevated temperature of fifty degrees Celsius. At standard temperature, viscosity increases by about eighteen percent in the pressure range from zero point one to fifty megapascals. In direct comparison, the viscosities of methane and carbon dioxide are larger than those of hydrogen, and both show a dominant pressure dependence that far exceeds the behavior of hydrogen viscosity. Hence, hydrogen has a much higher mobility than methane and carbon dioxide. The viscosities of hydrogen and methane are still most similar here in comparison and are in the same order of magnitude. Underground hydrogen storages could thus be used as a direct substitute for methane storage. Due to their viscosities, hydrogen and methane can be stored in a wide range\nqws8 | of underground reservoirs because they are not limited by reservoir conditions or depth. Rather, reservoirs are determined based on the geologic characteristics of the reservoirs, as appropriate containment features are required to seal against these mobile gases. But numerous subsequent studies have shown that the low density, viscosity, and molecular size of hydrogen result in more viscous fingering and poorer conformation during injection, faster migration toward structurally high sites, and some amount of unrecoverable hydrogen. For this reason, for example, recommend adjusting the flow rate of hydrogen and the size of the wellbore compared to operation with natural gas to minimize diffusion in porous media.\n877u | As previously described by us and other studies, the optimal depth, D, for underground hydrogen storage systems is in the range of eight hundred to one thousand one hundred meters depth. Assuming a mean surface temperature of eight point two degrees Celsius and an average geothermal gradient of thirty-two degrees Celsius per kilometer, a temperature range of thirty-three point eight to forty-three point four degrees Celsius results for the target depth. For an average density, Plith, of the overlying rock of two thousand three hundred to two thousand six hundred kilograms per cubic meter and a lithostatic factor, Flith, of zero point five to zero point seven, the pressure at which hydrogen could be stored in underground hydrogen storage systems can be determined using the following simple relationship:\nrzhj | P Hydrogen equals Flith multiplied by D multiplied by nine point eight one meters per second squared multiplied by Plith equals nine point zero three to nineteen point six four megapascals.\nbfax | This temperature and pressure range corresponds to the optimal conditions for the geological storage of hydrogen in porous storage systems. The so-called lithostatic factor was introduced here to represent the ratio of working pressure to lithostatic pressure in the reservoir. For this typical geological conditions for porous media storage, hydrogen has a low density and viscosity in the narrow ranges of six point six to thirteen point five kilograms per cubic meter and nine point two to nine point six micropascal-seconds, respectively. The influence of temperature and pressure variations on the density and viscosity of highly compressible hydrogen is thus almost negligible at this reservoir depth. In contrast, the thermophysical properties of carbon dioxide and methane behave in a much more pressure- and temperature-dependent manner, which is reflected in the relative density and viscosity ratios. Within the proposed reservoir range, the density and viscosity ratios of hydrogen and methane do not vary too much, whereas the corresponding ratios of hydrogen to carbon dioxide can vary by up to a factor of about two to three. This has to be considered when re-using former natural gas reservoirs with hydrogen.\nf2y8 | Four. Capacity estimates for underground hydrogen storage in Germany\no7qm | Four point one. Technical hydrogen storage capacity in former and current underground gas storage systems\nd52l | Underground gas storage facilities can be adapted for hydrogen storage and some of the currently operating underground storage facilities have already stored town gas with a hydrogen content of about fifty to sixty percent in the past. Thus, in a first step, we focus on the installed capacity of underground pore storages in Germany. The hydrogen storage capacity is calculated based on the recoverable volume of natural gas as reported by the State Authority for Mining,\nqlbb | Energy, and Geology in Germany. These data are based on empirical values, which are derived from technical and economic considerations for natural gas and, thus, provide sound estimates of the dynamic recovery of hydrogen. The amount of energy stored as hydrogen in the working gas, which describes the portion of gas that is cycled in and out of the reservoir, E Hydrogen, is calculated according to the modified equation after Mouli-Castillo et al., that writes\nnhsg | E Hydrogen equals higher heating value of hydrogen multiplied by working volume of methane multiplied by partial pressure of methane at standard temperature and pressure divided by partial pressure of hydrogen in aires and partial pressure of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure.",
