        "content": "cop0 | Our study also found a certain order in the reforms of the different areas of welfare administration over time that may help explain divergence and convergence. In both countries reforms started in the nineteen nineties with PES - a relatively small field compared to the social benefits administration in terms of public finance, vested interests of social partners, and employee numbers - , and in the two thousands reforms were expanded to the much larger field of social benefits. Despite the fact that we observed divergence between the leading public management models in the reforms in both countries, we view convergence in a similar attempt to enlarge the initial reform area of PES to the large field of social benefits in establishing a much wider reform (NAV and SUWI). Viewed in this way, there is divergence in reform trends between the two countries in terms of dominant NPG or NPM ideas, but convergence in increasingly comprehensive reform.\nlhkq | Governance levels and relationships between stakeholders\n82ju | A third lesson is that the (political) preference for central or decentral governance and for involving parties other than the government in the welfare administration can rapidly change. Norway has been described as social democratic and the Netherlands as corporatist, each with a tradition of strong relations with interest groups, social partners and civil society organizations. Both countries have then moved to coordination by 'market' and 'management' within a wider frame of state hierarchy and with a less crucial role of social partners in the welfare administration. However, we also saw divergence, especially in the past decade, that led to a certain \"revival\" of social partnership in the Netherlands, but not so much in Norway. This divergence needs more investigation. More broadly, we may ask is the reduced role of social partners over the past decades merely an effect of a political preference for 'more state' and/or 'more market', or is it the specific position of social partners in relationship with other policy areas or issues, that can explain differences between countries?\ny2qo | Critical doubts may also arise about reform trends that are often taken for granted in many policy studies, for example decentralization, outsourcing, or client orientation. For example, Weishaupt suggested decentralization could also be viewed as a process of recentralization where regional and local authorities are used as transmitters of national policy. Our study notices a common trend in Norway and the Netherlands where regional offices, and also municipalities and regional networks receive cumulative responsibilities, but at the same time operate under more central regulation and demands for efficiency. Our paper also pointed to the complexity associated with decentralization, where smaller municipalities have to scale up through mergers, joint intermunicipal social services or outsourcing to private and/or non-profit organizations.\n1piq | Moreover, welfare administrations are coordinated in a multi-level environment, where not only PES, social benefits and social assistance are involved, but also other policy areas, for example health and education. Especially in the NPG reforms, more and more actors are involved within the various administrative levels that have different views on the service provision and the organizational and administrative principles. More research is needed of this wider policy context and organizations, in light of the importance of optimizing welfare administrations and the ongoing struggle between central and regional needs and related stakeholders to influence social and labour market policies.\n7fqw | Conclusions\nrhaz | In this paper, Norway and the Netherlands have been used as critical cases to analyse convergence and divergence in reform efforts and their impact on the current welfare administrations. The two countries represent a general trend to change the labour market and social security system towards more \"active\" welfare states, to improve service coordination and responsiveness to client needs, and increase efficiency and innovation in service delivery. Their successive changes in social security and the promotion of paid work, as well as reforms in structure and coordination, such as the introduction of marketization in PES or the establishment of one stop-shops, reflect a broader international modernization trend visible in many OECD countries. We found that both countries significantly reformed their systems for welfare and employment services, using elements of NPM and post-NPM models, first moving in divergent ways and later showing more convergence in reform paths. However, although the welfare administrations in both countries significantly changed with increasingly similar types of reform, their current characteristics are more different than alike.\nwak1 | One conclusion is that a theory of public sector reform that aims to capture the role of NPM and NPG ideas in new welfare state arrangements should encompass the wider institutional context. Such a theory should go beyond the assumptions of the public management models and allow more room for explanations that take into account the social, historic and economic environment in which those reforms take place. However, as demonstrated by the radical reforms in both countries, path dependency did not explain divergence in our cases. Also the wider economic environment and economic crises did not fully explain divergence or convergence in reform. It has been noted that there is no clear explanation for variation in administrative reforms and their effects and there are still many differences in Europe when it comes to administrative reform. However, these are influenced not only by national institutions, but also by other institutional characteristics, \"such as differences between ministries and agencies, policy areas, degree of autonomy and size of the organization.\" Rather than the usual focus on high-level institutional context factors, we suggest to dive more deeply in the political decision-making process, and the relationships between different policy fields, levels and stakeholders in understanding reform.\nwtfz | Another conclusion is that a long-term research perspective is crucial to understand the complex interplay between NPM and NPG ideas and wider context factors as drivers of reform. When studying characteristics of welfare administrations over relatively short periods, findings may only reflect a \"temporary truth\". For example, comparing Norway and the Netherlands in the nineteen nineties and early two thousands would have stressed their most different pathways of change rather than the later convergence. Also, certain stakeholders can take on different roles over time. For example, the social partners are more important in the past and\nqy1i | present Dutch welfare administration compared to Norway, but studying their role exclusively between two thousand and two thousand thirteen/fifteen would have shown that the social partners were virtually absent in the Dutch welfare administration (except pension fund boards). These are important arguments for longitudinal studies to draw more balanced conclusions about public sector reform.",
