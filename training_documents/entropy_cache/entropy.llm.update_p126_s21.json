        "content": "xwza | Now suppose both T one and T two are positive. Then we get a remarkable consequence: as two systems exchange energy, with each staying in thermal equilibrium at every moment, expected energy can only flow from the system with higher temperature to the system with lower temperature!\nkw2g | Puzzle fifty-five. Suppose one or both of the temperatures T one, T two are negative. How does this conclusion change?\nevst | THE THIRD LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS: REVISITED\nr4ei | If a system has countably many states, with just one of lowest energy, and thermal equilibrium is possible for this system for some temperature T greater than zero, then its entropy in thermal equilibrium approaches zero exponentially fast as a function of one over T as T approaches zero from above.\nv3un | In our earlier work on the Third Law, we only studied systems with finitely many states. Later we saw how to compute entropy from the free energy and expected energy. This makes it a bit easier to handle systems with a countable infinity of states. In the following puzzles, which are only for the most devoted readers, let's use these ideas to prove and improve the Third Law for systems with countably many states.\nmmh7 | Earlier we worked with temperature, but it's cooler to use coolness. For all the following puzzles, let's suppose we have a system with a countable infinity of states n equals one, two, three, ... with energies E sub n. Also suppose thermal equilibrium is possible for some Bo greater than zero, i.e., the sum\n15mo | Z of Bo equals the summation L exp negative Bo E sub n, n equals one to infinity\nhaqw | converges. (Our arguments also apply to systems with finitely many states, where this convergence condition is automatic.)\n89i1 | Puzzle fifty-six. Show that the system's partition function, expected energy, free energy and entropy are well-defined for all B greater than Bo.\ngfu5 | Puzzle fifty-seven. Show that if we add some constant to the energy of each state\nmvzl | Èn equals E sub n plus c\nbuwu | we get a new 'shifted' system whose partition function, expected energy, free energy and entropy are related to those of our original system by\nzsfu | Z equals exp negative beta c times Z, expected value E equals expected value E plus c, F equals F plus c, S equals S\nhyvo | for all B greater than Bo.\n5l9v | Now further suppose that our original system has just one state of least energy. Earlier we saw that we could reindex the states so that E one is less than E two, less than or equal to E three, less than or equal to ... and E sub n approaches positive infinity. The same is true of our new shifted system, and let's choose c equals negative E one so that the lowest energy of the shifted system is zero. With this shift we have\n6tv1 | zero equals E one is less than E two is less than E three is less than...\nl79g | and E sub n approaches positive infinity.\nd8ia | Puzzle fifty-eight. Show that for any coolness <LATEX>\\beta \\geq \\beta _ { 0 }</LATEX> we have\nv012 | <LATEX>\\widetilde { Z } \\left( \\beta \\right) - 1 = \\sum _ { n = 2 } ^ { \\infty } e ^ { - \\beta \\widetilde { E } _ { n } } .</LATEX> Using this equation show\ncrl5 | <LATEX>| \\widetilde { Z } \\left( \\beta \\right) - 1 | \\leq e ^ { - \\left( \\beta - \\beta _ { 0 } \\right) \\widetilde { E } _ { 2 } } | \\widetilde { Z } \\left( \\beta _ { 0 } \\right) - 1 |</LATEX> and thus\nxqom | <LATEX>| \\widetilde { Z } \\left( \\beta \\right) - 1 | < \\mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \\left( \\beta - \\beta _ { 0 } \\right) \\widetilde { E } _ { 2 } }</LATEX> for some constant independent of <LATEX>\\beta .</LATEX> Use the fact that <LATEX>\\widetilde { F } \\left( \\beta \\right) = - \\frac { 1 } { \\beta } \\ln \\widetilde { Z } \\left( \\beta \\right)</LATEX> to show that for large enough\nmwss | <LATEX>\\beta ,</LATEX> <LATEX>| \\widetilde { F } \\left( \\beta \\right) | < \\mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \\left( \\beta - \\beta _ { 0 } \\right) \\widetilde { E } _ { 2 } }</LATEX> possibly for a different constant independent of <LATEX>\\beta .</LATEX> Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that\nqba8 | <LATEX>| F \\left( \\beta \\right) - E _ { 1 } | < \\mathrm { c o n s t } e ^ { - \\left( \\beta - \\beta _ { 0 } \\right) \\left( E _ { 2 } - E _ { 1 } \\right) } .</LATEX> Voilà! This shows that for a system with countably many states and just one state of lowest energy, if thermal equilibrium is possible at some positive temperature, then the free energy must approach this lowest energy exponentially fast as <LATEX>\\beta \\rightarrow + \\infty .</LATEX> Now let's show something similar for the expected energy. Again we use the shifted system to simplify the calculations. I'll leave more work to you this time.\n24cj | Puzzle fifty-nine.

Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that LaTeX formula: the expected value of E with respect to beta approaches E sub one exponentially fast as LaTeX formula: beta approaches positive infinity. Finally, since\nfcs1 | LaTeX formula: S equals k beta times the quantity F minus the expected value of E and both LaTeX formula: F and LaTeX formula: the expected value of E approach LaTeX formula: E sub one exponentially fast as LaTeX formula: beta approaches positive infinity, conclude that LaTeX formula: S approaches zero exponentially fast as",
