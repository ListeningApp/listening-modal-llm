You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

uooz | Figure 1. Schematic diagram of protein overexpression via AAV in the substantia nigra dopamine neurons. When an AAV carrying protein or RNA is expressed in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra where dopamine neurons are vulnerable to stress, the consequences of excessive overexpression may result in a number of events detrimental to cell survival. These include the increased formation of stress granules, increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and impairment of the proteasome function and autophagy. This could further result in impairments in vesicle fusion at the synapse and difficulties in the dopamine release and pacemaking functions of the neuron. This would culminate in reduced neuronal activity and may result in the death of the neuron. (BIP: Binding immunoglobulin protein).
pxbq | As far as recommending a control for neurodegeneration research, the optimal control for «-syn should be considered. Using similar titers or particle numbers of «-syn and control viral vectors would be essential to evaluate «-syn specificity on causing degeneration of dopamine neurons. GFP and similar proteins are often used as controls, but, as they themselves can cause neurodegeneration and immune responses, are they really the best controls in all cases? We would also consider using mammalian proteins instead of commonly used fluorescent proteins derived from marine organisms. It would also be worthwhile considering a protein that forms oligomers that are not known to cause neuronal pathology. Endogenous «-syn likely is in soluble oligomeric form [90], and its aggregation and fibril forms may be important in disease pathology due to their toxicity [91]. Thus, it would be important to use proteins that produce non-toxic oligomers to compare the in vivo effects in the

lq35 | 6. Conclusions
3g9w | AAV as a vehicle to deliver both therapeutic proteins and potentially toxic or pathogenic proteins has been widely used and high protein expression is found in the brain even after long periods of time, making it a powerful tool in therapy and disease models. Consideration of whether to inject AAV into the striatum or the substantia nigra due to the intrinsic properties of the substantia nigra dopamine neurons is an important aspect in neurotrophic therapy. There is also evidence of unspecific immune responses or cell death due to protein overexpression in the substantia nigra in general, and therefore using foreign proteins in neurodegeneration studies should be considered closely. After reviewing the literature on previously published AAV-x-syn studies and performing a series of experiments, it is clear that, while it is possible to achieve mild degeneration in this model, caution needs to be taken in selecting appropriate control vectors when targeting the substantia nigra in order to avoid proteinopathy or RNA toxicity [65].
