        "content": "90no | We clustered these three hundred eleven methods into twenty-seven categories, or method typologies, verifying and debating them in a workshop setting, held at the Stockholm Resilience Centre in October twenty sixteen. Our motivation for categorizing methods was twofold: One, abstracts were not consistently detailed in the kind of methods that they highlighted; Two, it was difficult to conduct a meaningful analysis of more than three hundred methods in a way that we could service our objective of providing an overview of the field. We assigned each method to a single category, although many methods could fit under several categories. Categories were based on the way that these methods were perceived to be used in SES research by experts at the workshop, and ones that were considered to have a similar function, or that had similar sets of assumptions. Some categories contained only one or two methods, e.g., agent-based modeling, because workshop participants felt that they were either very broadly used in SES research, or fulfilled a unique function. Conversely, other categories, e.g. statistical methods, contained a diversity of methods, but were not seen to play a unique role in SES research, and resources for their use are readily available. The final set of categories is intended to provide an entry point for discussion around methods that are being used in SES research, and not as a definitive list of methods that can or should be used.\njt0y | To obtain the frequency of method categories in our database, we searched the full set of four thousand four hundred seventy-nine place-based studies for the three hundred eleven methods we had extracted from the subset of two thousand articles, and classified which categories each record belonged to. We were able to categorize two thousand seven hundred forty-two of our place-based articles in this way. Thus, the remaining one thousand seven hundred thirty-seven articles, or thirty-eight percent, either did not mention the methods we detected in our search, or did not mention any methods in their abstracts. Readers should thus keep in mind that the list of methods identified in this study was not comprehensive.\nqb7o | Features and dynamics of complex adaptive systems\noae5 | We used Preiser et al.'s typology of six organizing principles of CAS to qualitatively assess each method category in terms of its ability to account for key organizing principles of CAS. By \"account\" we mean the extent to which a method's assumptions and application allow them to investigate systems that are constituted relationally, context-dependent, radically open, adaptive, dynamic, and have complex causality. We chose this typology on account of Preiser et al.'s clear conceptualization of SES as CAS. We distinguished between method categories that \"did not account for this feature of complexity\" zero; \"can account for this feature of complexity, depending on how it is employed\" one, sometimes; \"can account for this feature of complexity, and is usually employed in a way that does\" two, most times; and \"explicitly accounts for this\ns0fl | element of complexity in the way it is constituted\" three, always. In our analysis, we considered the ways in which the different types of methods are, to our knowledge, normally used. Each of the authors independently scored the method clusters against each principle, and subsequently debated the scores that we disagreed on. Based on our discussions, we simplified our scores into two categories: \"does not usually account for this complexity feature\" zero, and \"usually accounts for this complexity feature\" x.\n43ia | RESULTS\n3g2y | Of the chosen search terms, \"nature society relations\" seventy-one point eight percent, \"social-ecological\" thirty-one point seven eight percent, \"man-environment relations\" twenty-nine point six seven percent, \"socio-ecological\" seventeen point one five percent, \"social-environmental\" twelve point one percent, and \"coupled human\" three point two percent were the most commonly used in the full final result set. Many publications contain more than one of these key words. The term \"man-environment relations\" and \"human environment\" appeared to be more popular in earlier years, whilst the term \"social-ecological,\" \"socio-ecological\" and \"nature-society relations\" have become more dominant in recent years.\ngc7v | Growth of the SES research space\nwqfv | Our results show that there is a significant increase in the number of publications in the SES space, relative to the growth in all publications over time. Significant change points were detected between nineteen eighty-nine and nineteen ninety, between nineteen ninety-nine and two thousand, and two thousand nine and two thousand ten. A single change point analysis revealed the change between nineteen ninety-nine and two thousand to be the most significant change point. Similarly, the Bayesian change point analysis revealed most probable change points between nineteen eighty-nine and nineteen ninety. but put a third change point between twenty twelve and twenty thirteen. A fourth change point, between two thousand eight and two thousand nine, had a posterior probability of zero point six zero four. A posterior probability is a term in Bayesian statistics that refers to the conditional probability assigned to a proposition after relevant evidence has been considered.\nj30a | Journals over time\n7bdk | We identified one thousand two hundred thirty-four different sources that published papers on SES. The top twenty journals each published between zero point six three percent and seven point seven three percent of all publications, accounting for twenty-eight point zero five percent of publications in total. There were significant differences in the median number of publications between the five most prominent journals, with Ecology and Society having significantly more publications, compared to Ambio, Ecological Economics, Global Environmental Change, and Journal of Environmental Management. There were no significant differences between other journals. Ambio and Global Environmental Change published proportionally more papers in the SES field prior to two thousand, while Ecology and Society has become increasingly dominant as the main journal publishing SES research since two thousand.\nfim0 | Types and scale of SES research",
