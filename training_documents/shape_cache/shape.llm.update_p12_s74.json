Systems like FFIT could include this measurement.\nhy0l | We, therefore, reject hypothesis four.\n4jmz | A one-way between-groups analysis of variance explored the FFIT body shape's association with shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurements. There was a statistically significant difference at the P is less than zero point zero five level for shoulder measurements for the FFIT's seven body shapes; F left six, eighty-eight point eight seven right equals forty-one point six five eight, P is less than zero point zero one. The squared was zero point one six, indicating a large effect size. The A N O V A test achieved left one minus beta right error probability equals one point zero, Effect size F equals zero point four one, satisfying our statistical power requirements. Table seven presents the post hoc pairwise comparisons using the Tukey H S D test, with a Bonferroni adjustment of\nb7cq | P equals zero point zero zero seven. Despite the A N O V A's statistically significant result, there is little difference between shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) and the FFIT Body Shapes. While Top Hourglass has a significantly different shoulder measurement than every other body shape, other body shapes have at least one insignificant difference. Figure five visualizes the confidence intervals, revealing the significant overlap between shoulder measurements and body shapes. Therefore, we cannot imply a person's shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurement with confidence from the FFIT body shape alone.\n0b39 | Discussion Unauthoritative body shape classification\nqecd | We show that the FFIT Body shape classification system is unauthoritative because slight differences in measurement placement definition leads to different\n1o7p | shape classifications of the same body: in up to thirty-nine point six percent of cases. Something likely to occur because of variabilities in scanner definition and a lack of clarity regarding measurement definitions that hold the same nomenclature. This paper, therefore, highlights a limitation in the current body shape calculation methodologies, stemming from applying inconsistent measurement definitions in the FFIT. The results verify the FFIT may classify a single person in up to three different body shapes depending on the measurement definitions associated with the named measurement. With a vague definition of body shape between sources, multiple shape interpretations occur depending on where on the body the measurement is placed, highlighted within Table one.\ncp13 | Hourglass and rectangle are the dominant body shapes within our sample, as Table three shows. However, the shape classification transforms with the alteration in measurement definitions; see Table three and Figure four. The FFIT's waist, for example, is higher in the waist region than SizeUK's waist, as defined by the SizeUK Measurement Extraction Protocol. The mismatch in measurement definitions emphasizes high specificity's importance in the way ergonomists and garment construction practitioners take measurements to extract the repeatable and accurate measurements that drive shape classification.\nbgre | Significantly smaller waist measurements in the FFIT causes alternative body shape classifications. These arose when the three D body scanner searched for the narrowest point within the FFIT's broader waist region of six point three five centimeters. The difficulty here is the three D body scanner's propensity to place the waist at the ribcage's base, a measurement smaller than the actual waist. The actual waist should occur in the waist region's soft tissue. Furthermore, as Sokolowski and Bettencourt note, the FFIT assumes the waist region is smaller than the bust and hip. Sokolowski and Bettencourt show that the FFIT's categorization as Yim Lee et al.'s formulate incorrectly categorizes plus-sized women often because the waist circumferences were larger than either bust or hip.\n57lp | In summary, ergonomists and garment construction practitioners require a non-equivocal and repeatable set of measurement placement definitions to produce a stable and repeatable body shape classification system. The FFIT does not adhere to this, using flawed Hip and Waist definitions that can place measurements in inappropriate regions. If the FFIT instead uses an anatomically correct Hip definition as SizeUK's Measurement Extraction Protocol uses - it will raise a question about the mathematical descriptors' accuracy, presented in Table A one in Appendix. The mathematical descriptors were, after all, developed using information from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design and fit, and the visual analysis of segmental proportions that exist in the female body's bust-to-hips zone. Ergonomists, garment construction practitioners, and researchers cannot, therefore, consider the FFIT as accurate or appropriate enough for scientific or cultural discussion, a forum requiring non-equivocal categorization.\nukth | The need for shoulder anthropometrics\nkpvt | Our results show two shoulder measurements differentiate between the FFIT body shape classifications Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) and Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Caliper). While the FFIT shapes may have an eminent power in predicting horizontal shoulder widths, the remaining measurements only show small to medium effect sizes. These close associations show limited power relative to the higher complexities of shoulder anthropometrics such as pitch, slope length, and front-to-back depth. Multiple interpretations of the FFIT definitions confound this, as Figure four outlines. Including shoulder measurements within a more advanced future body shape classification system may lead to more effective and stable shape outcomes that align to newer I S O standards. This outcome is expected yet previously unproven. FFIT has a limited applicability in defining more complex body morphology than 'typical' female form as Sokolowski and Bettencourt's evolution of FFIT to include\njie2 | plus-sized women proves. Existing knowledge of anthropometric inter-relationships and how alternative Body Shape algorithms utilize different body measurements indicates the need for a study addressing body shape that is consistent. However, we show Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measurements have a large effect size differentiating body shape classification. It is surprising that FFIT excludes the Shoulder-to-Shoulder (horizontal) measurement given its importance in industrial ergonomics and garment construction and use systems that predate FFIT. Measurement selection is, after all, mutually exclusive to anthropometric measurement extraction technology. Through using the FFIT, ergonomists, academics, and garment construction practitioners have a deficiency in how they consider bodies.\nd0ik | Industrial implications",
