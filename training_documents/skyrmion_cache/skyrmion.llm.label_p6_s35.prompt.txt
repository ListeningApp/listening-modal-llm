o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

y5r7 | We elucidate the appearance and robustness of quantum skyrmion lattices as a function of the external magnetic field, the strength of DMI, and perturbations of the form Eq. (2) due to uniaxial anisotropy. For this calculation, we have concen- trated on a triangular lattice with disk boundary conditions of diameter L = 9 sites, for which we obtain a single centered skyrmion for B = J = - 0.5D in the unperturbed case K = 0 [see Fig. 2(e)]. We relax the fine-tuned parameter lines of Fig. 2 by variations of B, J, and consider nonzero uniaxial anisotropies for J < 0 by varying K.
lrry | Based on our simulations, we predict the existence of at least three distinct quantum phases of our model: (i) a region hosting HS states for weak field amplitudes, (ii) a valley for field strengths of the order of B ~ - 0.5D, which features a lattice formed by quantum skyrmions of radius r ~ 3a (SKX3a), and (iii) an FP phase where spins align parallel to the external field.
hvhm | Helical spin spiral states are characterized by a vanishing average polarization m2, whereas field-polarized states are maximally polarized (up to finite-size effects). As shown in Fig. 2, quantum skyrmions are embedded in a background of field-polarized spins, and as a consequence, the state in the skyrmion lattice phase will have a finite polarization smaller than a corresponding field-polarized state. We numerically confirm this intuitive picture and find disjoint intervals of average polarization mz uniquely linked to each phase [see Fig. 4(a)], which can be summarized in the zero-temperature phase diagram presented in Fig. 9. Note that Fig. 9 is obtained by simulations of a fixed flake system size and is therefore only qualitatively correct in the thermodynamic limit. Further- more, the interplay between system size and skyrmion length scale might lead to incommensurate phases which will be the subject of future work. In order to determine the exact position of quantum critical points or the nature of the quantum phase transition, a finite size extrapolation is necessary, a study which we leave for future work.
863b | Our results about the dependence of the skyrmion phase on the uniaxial anisotropy are in qualitative agreement with cor- responding classical systems, where it is known that a weak uniaxial anisotropy tends to stabilize skyrmion configurations at smaller magnetic fields [14,60]. Furthermore, we observe that the skyrmion radius increases with -J/D, such that quite large spin-1/2 systems might be needed to resolve even in- dividual quantum skyrmions. Based on our results for J = -0.5D we conjecture that the skyrmion lattice phase should also exist for such cases where the individual quasiparticles have a larger radius, but due to limitations dictated by the nu- merical complexity (which we discuss in Appendix A), other numerical techniques must be consulted to make quantitative predictions about the phase diagram for -J/D >> 0.5. Similar values of the exchange coupling are expected in present thin film experiments [61], thereby making our results of practical relevance.
fj24 | Besides the ferromagnetic SKX3a phase, which is the fo- cus of this work, we find signatures of a quantum skyrmion lattice phase in the absence of exchange coupling and even for antiferromagnetic couplings J ≤ 0. However, because of the significantly enhanced entanglement [see Fig. 9(c)], the MPS ansatz for this phase requires an exponential scaling of the bond dimension with the system size, and

ffx8 | VII. SUMMARY
s6su | We have demonstrated that the ground state of the two- dimensional ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model in the presence of DMI hosts quantum skyrmions at intermediate magnetic fields B ~ J = - D/2. The resulting magnetic tex- tures are characterized by a central spin pointing opposite to the direction of the applied magnetic field and winds radially outwards toward the field-polarized environment, similar to a classical Néel skyrmion. For periodic boundary conditions and in the thermodynamic limit, we expect the ground state of the skyrmion lattice phase to be degenerate, scaling with the area of the individual skyrmion quasiparticles, such that the bulk of a system with open boundary conditions corresponds to a spontaneously symmetry broken state. The existence of quantum skyrmions yields experimental signatures in the position-dependent magnetization, the average polarization, and the structure factor, and we showed that these observables allow a distinction between a spin spiral phase at small mag- netic fields, a skyrmion phase at intermediate magnetic fields, and a field-polarized phase at large magnetic fields.

v3r2 | While the spin texture is reminiscent of classical skyrmions, we should point out that in the present case, the skyrmion phase arises as a quantum ground state at zero tem- perature with open boundary conditions. In contrast, classical skyrmions typically occur at finite temperatures and result from a minimization of the free energy. Moreover, our exam- ination of the resulting quantum state using the entanglement entropy and the concurrence has revealed that the quantum skyrmion state features significant entanglement shared be- tween spin pairs of the skyrmion boundary. We argued that the quantum and classical states can be distinguished by the norm of the polarization | (Sr) | ≤ 1/2 (conserved for classi- cal states) and by corrected correlation functions (vanishing for classical states). We therefore conclude that a semiclassi- cal treatment of the quantum skyrmion based on a classical magnetic texture would not necessarily capture the internal degrees of freedom of a quantum skyrmion.
nv42 | Towards larger system sizes, we found that the quan- tum skyrmion phase is characterized by a regular lattice of skyrmions. As the size of individual skyrmions is determined by the system parameters B, J, D, and K, a regular lattice requires commensurability between the lattice size and the skyrmion size. While our numerical simulations cannot reach the limit of infinite system size, our results allow us to extrap- olate that the ground state in the thermodynamic limit features a dense packing of quantum skyrmion textures. Each of these quantum skyrmions has entanglement localized near its do- main wall, but the entanglement between different skyrmions is small, which suggests that they can be approximated as individual quasiparticles.
xags | We expect that our results may guide the develop- ment of an effective analytical field theory of the quantum skyrmion phase. Based on our experience, we conclude that variational tensor networks provide a suitable numeri- cal technique to study these systems. This is not surprising for gapped quantum phases with short-range interactions and bounded entanglement. Nevertheless, using MPS for a two-dimensional system is not without pitfalls, as the necessary mapping on a one-dimensional system causes non- local interactions. We have made sure that our results have fully converged for lattice sizes corresponding to individual skyrmions. However, we have seen that the numerical errors grow for the system sizes required for 4 x 4 skyrmion lattices (29 x 29 spin-1/2 in total). For such large systems, we expect our results to be only qualitatively correct.
jc47 | Regarding alternative numerical schemes, we have verified that our MPS results agree quantitatively with all available results from exact diagonalization. We have also compared our results to variational methods based on neural-network quantum states. However, we found significant deviations between the exact result and neural-network states even for small system sizes, and the error was already on the or- der of 10% for the energy eigenvalues. This suggests that neural-network states may not provide an efficient variational ansatz for mesoscopic spin systems with DMI. We expect that quantum Monte-Carlo simulations might be useful to go to larger system sizes. However, the inclusion of DMI together with an external magnetic field brings about a sign problem that hinders convergence. Other promising tensor network states for 2D spin systems with DMI are variational tree

We expect finite PEPS to outperform MPS for larger spin-1/2 systems hosting skyrmion lattices, especially since recently a more efficient gradient-based optimization has been developed based on automatic differentiation tech- niques [57,64,65].

One of the most established algorithms, called DMRG [70-72], is understood as a sequential variational optimization of adjacent MPS tensors until convergence is reached. Our DMRG simulations are mainly based on the Ju- lia package ITensors [73], and we made available a condensed version, reproducing Fig. 2(e), on GitHub [26]. Addition- ally, we cross-checked ITensor with TeNPy simulations [74], and upload the condensed version for the TeNPy framework alongside the julia implementation [26].

For a finite system with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the objects A,in) are matrices, except for the two boundary vectors A(11) and A IN) N, such that the result of the product is a scalar. The dimension of the matrices M = maxn dim (A(in)) is called the bond dimension. If M is fixed to an arbitrary integer, then the MPS representation of quantum states can be used as a variational ansatz to approximate the minimum energy eigenstate. The quality of this approxima- tion is controlled by M. This is particularly transparent in the so-called Schmidt decomposition |$) = Li-1 Si IVA,i) IVB,i) in which A and B denotes an arbitrary bipartition of the sys- tem and |Va,i) E Ha forms a complete basis in the Hilbert space of the part & E {A, B}. The Schmidt values si are the roots of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, and therefore related to the von Neumann entanglement entropy S = - X4-1 |sil2 In(|sil2). Consider a truncation M < M, then states with a small weight in the reduced density matrix are neglected, and the overlap between the original state with bond dimension M is reduced.
q1q2 | Similarly to quantum states having an MPS representation, quantum operators have a matrix product operator (MPO) rep- resentation. Let ME be the bond dimension of the Hamiltonian MPO, then the standard DMRG algorithm bears a leading nu- merical complexity of O(M3 MH) (assuming that MH < M2).
cb7r | For generic many-body states rewritten as MPS, M is an extensive quantity in the number of sites and diverges in the thermodynamic limit. If the target state of a one-dimensional system obeys an area law of the quantum entanglement, then the von Neumann entropy is guaranteed to be a finite constant [75]. Consequentially, M remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, and MPS becomes exact, which explains the success of DMRG applied to one-dimensional quantum systems. De- spite its limitations in two dimensions, DMRG is frequently applied to ladder systems and can even yield reliable re- sults for strongly correlated lattices, especially in the case of

hd35 | quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg models. We expect MPS to reliably capture the physics of the quantum skyrmion lattice phase because the external field polarizes the environment, and the resulting states carry no entanglement in the paramag- netic regions, but localized entanglement around the domain wall of the skyrmion.
