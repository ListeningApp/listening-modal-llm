You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hy0l | Empirical Fitting Equation
4jmz | In order to evaluate the effects of the confining pressure, the stress ratio at consolidation, and the overconsolidation his-
b7cq | tory on the secant Young's modulus <LATEX>E _ { s e c }</LATEX> under small and in- termediate strain levels, an empirical study was performed on a large number of triaxial compression test results on Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands.
0b39 | It has generally been recognized that the shear modulus of sand can be expressed by means of an empirical equation as a function of the void ratio, the confining pressure, and strain levels (Hardin and Richart 1963; Iwasaki and Tatsuoka 1977; Jamiolkowski et al. 1994a). For example, Iwasaki and Tat- suoka indicated that the shear modulus of clean sands obtained from resonant column and cyclic torsional tests can be ex- pressed by
qecd | <LATEX>G _ { c q } = K \left( \gamma \right) F \left( e \right) p ^ { \prime n \left( \gamma \right) }</LATEX> (1)
1o7p | where <LATEX>G _ { e q } = \mathrm { e q u i v a l e n }</LATEX> shear modulus; <LATEX>K \left( \gamma \right) = \mathrm { m a t e r i a l }</LATEX> con- stant that depends on shear strain level; <LATEX>F \left( e \right) = \mathrm { v o i d }</LATEX> ratio func- tion; <LATEX>p ^ { \prime } = m e a n</LATEX> effective stress; and <LATEX>n \left( \gamma \right) = \mathrm { e m p i r i c a }</LATEX> exponent that depends on shear strain level.
cp13 | According to Hardin and Blandford (1989), it is also pos- sible to express the dependence of the small strain shear mod- ulus <LATEX>G _ { 0 }</LATEX> on the current state of a soil by means of the following relationship:
bgre | <LATEX>G _ { 0 } = S _ { i j } F \left( e \right) \left( O C R \right) ^ { k } p _ { a } ^ { \left( 1 - n _ { i } - n _ { j } \right) } \sigma _ { i } ^ { \prime n _ { i } } \sigma _ { i } ^ { \prime n _ { j } }</LATEX> (2)
57lp | where Sij = nondimensional material constant of given soil that also reflects its fabric; <LATEX>k = \mathrm { e m p i r }</LATEX> exponent that depends on plasticity index (PI) of soil; <LATEX>\sigma _ { i }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\sigma _ { j } ^ { \prime } = \mathrm { e f f e c t i v e }</LATEX> principal stresses acting on plane in which <LATEX>G _ { 0 }</LATEX> is measured; <LATEX>n ;</LATEX> and <LATEX>n _ { i } =</LATEX> empirical exponents; and <LATEX>p _ { a } =</LATEX> stress.
ukth | Moreover, Hardin and Blandford suggested that the Young's modulus for elastic compressive strain increments in a certain direction is a unique function of the normal stress in that di- rection. Lo Presti et al. (1995) and Hoque and Tatsuoka (1998) reported similar results for triaxial tests performed on clay and sand.
kpvt | As mentioned before, it was indicated that the secant Young's modulus depends on the stress ratio and the stress history under consolidation. Moreover its effects were differ- ent from sand to sand. Thus, to clarify the effects of the con- fining pressure, the stress ratio at consolidation (i.e., isotropic and <LATEX>K _ { 0 }</LATEX> consolidation) and the overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { s c } }</LATEX> under wide strain levels (0.001 to 1%), an empirical study was performed on triaxial com- pression test results using the following equations:
jie2 | <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { s c c } \left( \mathrm { I C } \right) } = S _ { \mathrm { r } } F \left( e \right) \sigma _ { \mathrm { r e } } ^ { \prime n } p _ { a } ^ { \left( 1 - n \right) }</LATEX> (isotropic normally consolidated sand)
d0ik | (3) <LATEX>E _ { \sec \left( K _ { 0 } \right) } = a S _ { v } F \left( e \right) \sigma _ { w } ^ { \prime \prime } p _ { a } ^ { \left( 1 - n \right) } \left( K _ { 0 } \text { normally } c \text { onsolidated sand } \right)</LATEX> (4) where Sy = nondimensional material constant that depends on
0x0s | axial strain level of isotropic normally consolidated sands; <LATEX>F \left( e \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= \mathrm { v o i d }</LATEX> ratio function <LATEX>\left[ \dot { F \left( e \right) } = \left( 2 . 1 7 - e \right) ^ { 2 } / \left( 1 + e \right) \right.</LATEX> (Toyoura and Ticino sands) and <LATEX>F \left( e \right) = \left( 3 . 8 2 - e \right) ^ { 2 } / \left( 1 + e \right)</LATEX> (Quiou sand)]; <LATEX>\sigma _ { w } ^ { \prime } = \mathrm { e f f e c t i v e }</LATEX> axial stress at end of consolidation; <LATEX>n</LATEX> = empirical exponent that depends on axial stress and axial strain level of isotropic normally consolidated sands; <LATEX>p _ { a } =</LATEX> reference stress (98 kPa); and a = empirical constant that
4exe | <LATEX>\& a = 1 . 0</LATEX> depends on axial strain level of <LATEX>K _ { 0 }</LATEX> normally consolidated sands.
0myz | Figs. 3-5 show the comparison of the secant modulus ob- tained from the test data and the empirical fitting equation for normally consolidated [isotropic consolidated (IC) and <LATEX>K _ { 0 }</LATEX> con- solidated <LATEX>\left. \left( K _ { 0 } \mathrm { C } \right) \right]</LATEX> Toyoura, Quiou, and Ticino sands for three kinds of strain levels, respectively. Although a certain scatter is recognized, it can be seen that the empirical fitting equation that uses (3) and (4) above agrees well with the test data at small and intermediate strain levels and stress ratios for nor- mally consolidated sands. Table 3 lists the parameter values of the empirical fitting equation for the three sands.
