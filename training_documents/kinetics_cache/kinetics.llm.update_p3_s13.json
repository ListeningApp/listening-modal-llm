        "content": "b3bt | Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters\n0w8m | Here we introduce a method of estimating the kinetic parameters in our hierarchical model using the expression data of each gene. For a given expression read of observed cells, the most common parameter estimation method is the maximum likelihood estimation, which can be formulated as the following optimization problem of five parameters zero equals (a, b, c, k, h) in our case\nvcu3 | arg min (negative L(y; zero)) equals arg min theta negative In (P(Y equals y; zero)),\nhjzj | Because of the complex integral and unnormalized probability mass function in Equation six, calculating the integral directly through the MCMC method would be at a high cost of computation, and in particular, it is hard to use in the analysis of genome-wide data. Therefore, we apply the Generalized Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Rules to Equation six instead of the use of the MCMC method, realizing a rapid calculation in inference:\nj79f | P(Y equals y; zero) equals N [(x) e-x,a(one plus)-one-x/b (one plus (x/k) dx zero\n6tbv | \nxb13 | where x i, w i can be determined by the generalized Laguerre polynomials.\ncxqi | In particular, a simple algebraic transformation in Equation seven yields the explicit expression of the probability distribution in the case of non-feedback:\nqfmx | P(Y equals y ;- ) equals one hundred (x)\" y! o-lambda chi\nrut3 | bar (a) one x a-le-x/b dx\nm3cp | equals (a plus y) Beta (a, y plus one) (b) plus one)/ plus a' (bx) y\nmq4s | \n95el | where Beta is the Beta function.\na0a5 | Optimization method and initial values setting\ngocl | To realize a fast calculation for solving the optimization problem (Equation eight) of parameter estimation, we use the f min con function in the LBFGS method of M A T L A B, a nonlinear programming solver, to find the minimum of the optimization problem given a set of initial values and parameter intervals a equals (ten to the power of negative one, thirty), b equals (one, twenty), k equals (one, one thousand three), h equals (negative ten, negative one) or (one, ten). For each gene and each case of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks, we repeatedly solve the optimization problem thirty times.\nob1z | We restrict that the initial values of the optimization problem obey the following rules. First, we consider initial\nm4cb | points of a (burst frequency) and b (burst size). Here X is a random variable of the distribution in Equation five. Since Gamma distribution is a special case of Equation five, we assume that the initial points a and b follow \nm61y | E left[ X right] equals a b, Var left[ X right] equals a b squared.\nu2ob | On the other hand, by considering the initial values of Y generated by our hierarchical model, we have\n2gnm | E left[ Y right] equals E left[ E left[ Y given X right] right] equals lambda E left[ X right] equals lambda a b , Var left[ Y right] equals E left[ Var left[ Y given X right] right] plus Var left[ E left[ Y given X right] right] equals lambda a b plus lambda squared a b squared.\nemgw | Given the expectation and variance of Y, we can in return estimate burst frequency a and burst size b by rearranging Equations twelve and thirteen, which are then taken as initial values\nxaqt | a equals fraction left[ E left[ Y right] squared right] over left[ Var left[ Y right] minus E left[ Y right] right] , b equals left( fraction left[ Var left[ Y right] right] over left[ E left[ Y right] right] minus one right) over lambda\n5rcb | Usually, the transcriptional rate in the OFF state is much smaller than that in the ON state. And a small enough leaky rate does not affect the distribution shape of gene expression. Therefore, we fix & at the constant of zero point zero five during our inference. The h value is extracted from a uniform distribution between the integer negative five and negative one (positive feedback) or integers one and five (negative feedback). And the values of parameter k are extracted from the log-uniform (logarithm base ten) distribution on interval\n524j | left[ zero , two right] . Model selection\nxd3m | Using the above inference method, we obtain ninety inferred results for each case of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks. Then, we filter out the unreliable results on the inference boundary, which are possibly caused by the optimization program setting. On this basis, we compute the value of the corrected Akaike information criterion and select the best model corresponding to the smallest AICc,\n8qb6 | A I C c equals negative two log L left( widehat theta right) plus two k plus fraction two k left( k plus one right) over n minus k minus one,\nwkbn | where the maximum likelihood L left( widehat theta right) is the result during the inference run, k is the number of model parameters, and n is the sample size of observed data.\nftfg | Validation on synthetic sc R N A-sequencing data\n7xi5 | In order to check whether the above statistical inference method can effectively infer burst frequency, burst size, and feedback form in our hierarchical model, we produce synthetic single-cell R N A data. Given a set of model parameter values theta equals left( a , b , epsilon , k , h right) , we first calculate the probability distributions of these parameters according to the method described in the above section and then carry out random samples according to the probability of each parameter value to obtain the input data for the inference process.\nw8r5 | We show the precision regions for the inference of burst kinetics (burst frequencies and burst sizes) under different",
