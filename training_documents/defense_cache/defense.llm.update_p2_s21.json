        "content": "f682 | Thirty weeks after infection, which is consistent with the differences in life cycles between these parasites. More interesting was a spontaneous decrease in eosinophil numbers in the absence of treatment, suggesting active downregulation of the eosinophilia, a process seen in other experimental volunteer infections. This active (and spontaneous) modulation of eosinophilia generally occurred when the migration of the larval forms ceased and the infections became patent (sexually mature adults began egg laying or larval release).\nli1k | EOSINOPHILS AND PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY\npbea | Epidemiologic evidence for the role of eosinophils in the immune response to helminth infections\nccpt | As early as nineteen thirty-nine, eosinophils were postulated to play a role in the immune response to helminth infection. Such hypotheses were based primarily on histopathologic evidence of eosinophils surrounding dying parasites in tissue biopsy specimens. Later, in vitro killing of parasites by eosinophils (in the presence of antibodies, complement, or both) and eosinophil granule products was demonstrated. Despite these in vitro findings and epidemiologic evidence correlating high eosinophil counts with resistance to posttreatment reinfection with Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni in human subjects, the in vivo role of eosinophils in immunity to helminth infection has been much more difficult to define. There has been conflicting evidence on the protective efficacy of eosinophils in animals depleted of eosinophils and subsequently challenged with a variety of parasites.\n0fpw | feature articles\ndqn8 | Reviews and\ncop0 | Overall, the discrepancy seen in the various studies examining the role of eosinophils in protective immunity in different animal models of parasite infections has been attributed to the redundancy of effector immune responses or to the basic differences in the animal models used.\nlhkq | Animal models\n82ju | Animal models of helminth infection have allowed for the assessment of the eosinophil's role in vivo. Treatment with anti-IL-five antibody prevents the tissue and blood eosinophilia that occurs in animal models of gastrointestinal helminth infection. However, such treatment has not been shown to increase susceptibility to infection in murine models of Trichinella spiralis, Trichuris muris, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, or schistosomiasis. Similarly, IL-five transgenic mice that have persistent increases of eosinophil levels do not demonstrate enhanced immunity to Trichinella spiralis or Schistosoma mansoni infection.\ny2qo | Eosinophils do appear to play a role in the killing of some helminths, particularly those with tissue-migratory stages. Larval stages of many of the intestinal helminths, including Strongyloides, Nippostrongylus, and Ascaris\n1piq | species, migrate through the lungs or skin on their way to the gastrointestinal tract. Although treatment with anti-IL-five antibody had no effect on primary infection with Strongyloides venezuelensis in mice, recovery of worms from the lungs after challenge infection was increased in anti-IL-five-treated mice compared with that in control animals. The most conclusive in vivo evidence for the role of eosinophils in helminth killing comes from experiments with diffusion chambers containing infective Strongyloides stercoralis larvae implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of mice. Not only were eosinophils the only cells that accumulated in the chamber concomitant with larval killing, but such killing could be prevented by means of inhibition of eosinophil migration into the chamber or treatment of the mice with anti-IL-five antibody.\n7fqw | In Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection in mice, immature worms develop in the brain before migrating to the lungs. Prolonged survival of intracranial worms resulting in a larger parasite burden in the lungs has been demonstrated in normal mice treated with anti-IL-five antibody, as well as in IL-five receptor alpha-deficient mice, which is again consistent with a role for eosinophils in tissue-based larval killing.\nrhaz | Animal models of protective immunity to the exclusively tissue-dwelling nematode Onchocerca species further support this hypothesis. In diffusion chamber studies of infective larval survival in immune mice, eosinophils were the only cells that accumulated in the chambers at the time of larval killing. Furthermore, similar to the results with Strongyloides species larvae, eosinophil larval contact was necessary for larval destruction to occur. In a different murine model system, mice infected with Onchocerca lienalis depleted of eosinophils (but not macrophages or neutrophils) with monoclonal antibodies showed delayed clearance of primary infection and abrogation of resistance to secondary infection.\nwak1 | Overall, despite the prevailing dogma, the animal models do not strongly support an indispensable role for eosinophils in immunity to most helminth parasites in vivo.\nwtfz | Human studies\nqy1i | In human subjects with onchocerciasis, the picture is somewhat more complex. Some studies of in vitro cytokine production in response to parasite antigens have demonstrated increased levels of IL-five production by PBMCs from putatively immune individuals living in areas endemic for onchocerciasis in comparison with infected individuals, whereas others have detected no difference in parasite antigen-induced IL-five production between these groups. The most compelling association between eosinophilia and protective immunity in human subjects comes from the elegant posttreatment reinfection studies in schistosomiasis that demonstrated a direct relationship between the lack of reinfection and the level of peripheral blood eosinophils in patients from areas endemic for both Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium infections.\n1k9e | Mechanism of eosinophil-mediated killing of helminth parasites\n5bjs | The mechanism by which eosinophil-mediated protection against helminth infection occurs is incompletely understood, but in most cases it appears to involve antibody-induced release, complement-induced release, or both of toxic granule proteins and reactive oxygen inter-\nuodj | feature articles\nk16v | Reviews and\nb2lm | mediates by activated eosinophils. Interestingly, evidence suggests that there might be significant differences in the susceptibility to and mechanisms of eosinophil-mediated killing between different life-cycle stages of the same parasite. Unlike protozoa, helminths are too big to be engulfed by phagocytes and can only be killed by these cells when the latter have been activated by products of the adaptive immune response.",
