        "content": "hntf | In the case of a greater than c-o, the power on U-I approaches zero so all voters buy exactly one vote in the direction of their preference as in one-person-one-vote. In this sense, QV is an optimal intermediate point between the extremes of dictatorship and majority rule. It is the one vote pricing rule under which voters who intend only their own gain are led, as if by an invisible hand, to advance the interests of society. We refer to voting based on a quadratic pricing rule as Quadratic Voting for obvious reasons.\n99fo | Three. Practical Promise\ny5r7 | While price-taking is a useful heuristic, it is unlikely to literally hold in game theoretic models of voter behavior. In other work, we have considered a variety of these models. We consider the most canonical case from the game theoretic literature, in which voters values are drawn independently and identically from a known value distribution and act as rational, risk-neutral expected utility maximizers. We show that under appropriate conditions and in all symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibria in large populations the price-taking assumption approximately holds for almost all voters and thus that the welfare losses from QV decay, generically at a rate, as the population grows. In another parallel to markets, this is the same rate of convergence of private goods markets towards efficiency as competition grows.\nlrry | The structure of game theoretic equilibrium is quite subtle and thus our rigorous mathematical proof of this result is long and technical. However, taking the approximations that we rigorously prove hold in this case to hold, appropriately adjusted, in other cases and using numerical methods, allows analysis of QV for other environments. One of us, with another co-author, considers the baseline model in smaller populations for a range of distributions numerically and finds that the welfare lost from QV relative to the optimum is very small (rarely more than a few percentage points) while that lost under one-person-one-vote may easily be near one hundred percent.\nhvhm | One of us uses these approximations to allow for collusion, uncertainty about the value distribution and the possibility that voters are not perfectly rational and consequentialist. In some of these settings QV performs better than in our baseline and it rarely has more than a very small welfare loss, again in contrast to one-person-one-vote. Furthermore, laboratory experiments on QV are largely consistent with these robustness conclusions. While participants do not play precisely as game theoretic equilibrium would predict, votes are generally linearly proportional to values with some noise, leading to outcome much closer to optimal than one-person-one-vote.\n863b | Each of these results has important limitations on its own; some are in stylized, or specific experimental, settings, while others are approximate or numerical. Together, however, we believe they suggest significant promise as they illustrate the robustness of this simple yet approximately optimal voting rule. This contrasts with other voting rules which are either optimal, but widely seen as too fragile to apply in practice, or which do not aim at optimality.\nuz3c | In the first category, the most famous proposal was Vickrey's original scheme as refined by Clarke and Groves, the first fully optimal mechanism. However, this approach is extremely sensitive to collusion by even a very small group. It also requires large and highly uncertain expenditures of money that make it heavily dependent on using real money rather than voice credits, a possibility that may be unjust given the inequality of wealth in most societies. As noted in our introduction, to address these problems, Groves and Ledyard and Hylland and Zeckhauser proposed mechanisms closely related to QV, but only applicable to continuous public goods problems, which rarely arise in practical applications. Other optimal mechanisms proposed in the literature are even less robust. Given this, practical attention has primarily focused on mechanisms that do not aspire to even approximate optimality, such as ones that do not allow expression of preference intensity or are like QV but with a linear costly voting function and thus induce dictatorship of the most intense voters.\nd5bi | QV aims to combine the simplicity and practicality of this latter group of designs with an approximation to the optimality of the first. This has allowed applications to polling and survey research, where evidence from initial studies shows significant improvements over existing methods of preference elicitation. Higher-stakes applications to politics or corporate governance remain far more speculative and are not advisable without further experimentation at smaller scales.\nba4l | Four. Radical Democracy, Radical Markets\nffx8 | However, cautious but increasingly ambitious experimentation seem warranted given the potential of QV to create a truly radical democracy in several senses. First, and most mechanically, QV may also be viewed as individuals receiving votes equal to the square root or radical of the voice credits they spend. Second, QV gets to the roots of what the framers of modern democratic institutions, such as Alexander Hamilton, the Marquis de Condorcet, and Jeremy Bentham, viewed as the aim of democracy: to ensure the state serves the general happiness of the people maximally. Third, QV radically expands the rights of citizens to fully and freely express their political views, liberating them from the straitjacket of one-person-one-vote influence rationing. In this sense, it shows how mechanism design can suggest fundamental and yet also practical reforms of social institutions.",
