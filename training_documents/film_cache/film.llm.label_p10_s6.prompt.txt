You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d5bi | Gendered film studies looks at the social purpose(s) of our stories and myths. Ideas and images of 'the masculine' or 'the feminine' are social constructions, and so we must attend to them as such, and ask who is creating these images. Whom do they benefit? Language is not a neutral medium of communication. Discourse/ language is the medium through which social power relations between different groups are reinforced or re-negotiated. We need to ask what kind of world the film constructs and whose values and ideas are being expressed through it. Do the film's representations challenge or affirm our own experiences of the world? Do

y219 | they construct a world of appearances that does not reflect our experiences? What purpose do the film's representations serve? Whose interests are best served by it? The key here is to remember that films (and other media) do not merely record the world as it is. They construct an image of the world, a mediated version of the world.
06ht | Following theorists such as Sarah Gilligan, it should be fairly clear that women have historically functioned within mainstream cinema as the following:
v3r2 | · Girlfriend.
nv42 | · Damsel in distress.
xags | · Angelic mother.
jc47 | · Whore.
ko3c | · Sexual object.
xek3 | · Erotic distraction.
bbpr | · Femme fatale/monster.
5zyf | · Castrating mother.
9own | Looking at the list above, we see that the stereotypical role of the female in the traditional Hollywood film has not been that of an agent. She does not drive the narrative action, nor is she involved in changing the storyline. As Sarah Gilligan says, 'her role within the film is to look good and to make the male protagonist look even better. Women are rarely cast in positions of power, and when they are, they are punished for their power. . . Woman's traditional role is to be helpless, need rescuing or agree with the actions and decisions of the male protagonist' (Gilligan 2003: 18).
bqfb | There should be a woman, but not much of one. A good horse is much more important. (Max Brand in Avni 2005)
wwdt | Feminist critics point out that these cinematic representations are mediated through the eyes and desires of the male director. The crucial point to remember is that woman exists as both a construction and a reality. 'Woman' is both a category, defined in opposition to men, and an individual physical person. We need only look around us at a few real women to understand that the image 'woman' does not always reflect the reality, and vice versa. Real individual women can, and do, perform 'womanhood' (as an image) but this image is not one that women have traditionally had a role in constructing. She is imitating an idealised and eroticised male construction of what women 'should' be. 'Woman' comes to represent not one person of the female sex, but a stereotype, a category defined by men and in

2e62 | opposition to men. Stereotyping is not always negative, but it tends to preserve and perpetuate power relations in society. It is in the interests of those in power to continue to stereotype those with lower status in a negative or expedient light, thus preserving the status quo (Nelmes 2003: 227).
75y3 | Even today, women have a relatively small role in constructing public images of womanhood'. A recent survey carried out by the UK Film Council and Skillset, the Sector Skills Council for the Audio Visual Industries, found that women in the British film industry are paid less than men even though they are better qualified. The survey found that women made up a third of the industry but 35% of women earn less than £20,000 a year, compared with 18% of men. At the same time, the number of men earning more than £50,000 nearly doubles the female figure. Women in the film industry were more likely to be graduates than men (60% compared with 39%), and while 17% of men have no qualifications, the same is true for just 5% of women. A June 2015 report by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that in 2012 only 26% of employees in the digital and creative industries were female, substantially lower than the national average of 47%, and down from 33% in 2002.2
s2g2 | In her study of employment figures for behind-the-scenes women working on the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2004, Dr Martha M. Lauzen of San Diego State University found that 21% of the films employed no women directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers or editors. Yet not a single one of the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2004 failed to employ a man in at least one of these roles. The study also found that women comprised only 5% of all directors working on the top 250 films of 2004. This represents a decline of 6 percentage points since 2000 when women accounted for 11% of all directors. Women accounted for only 12% of writers working on the top 250 films of 2004. In addition, female actors generally earn less than male actors.
q1q2 | The majority of directors in Hollywood are male and the majority of producers are male. This probably holds true in cinemas around the world. The movies that get the publicity budgets are made within male genres-blockbusters, war, science fiction or thrillers. These films seem to feature a central male character who is facing a male villain, and has a male best friend (who often gets killed by the villain in the penultimate reel, justifying the hero's killing of the villain). The female characters are there to titillate, to be in distress and rescued, and occasionally to guarantee the heterosexuality of the hero. (Butler 2002: 42)
cb7r | Lauzen's figures for 2011 were equally grim, with women comprising only 18% of all directors, executive producers, producers, writers, cinematographers and editors working on the US top 250 domestic grossing films. This represents an increase of 1 percentage point from 1998. Women accounted for 5% of directors, which is half as many as were directing films in 1998. Ninety-four per cent (94%) of all the films

epu7 | in the study had no female directors. Of the 1,200 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2018, only 4.3% were directed by women, according to a study released by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.
7od1 | In addition, female actors generally earn less than male actors for equivalent sized roles, with Angelina Jolie (the highest paid female actor) making $33 million per film on average, roughly the same amount as the two lowest-ranked leading men Liam Neeson and Denzel Washington. Of the 16 biggest paychecks earned by actors per film in 2013, not a single one was earned by a female actor.3 In 2015 a hack of Sony Pictures emails revealed that Jennifer Lawrence was paid only 7% of the profits of American Hustle's (2013), whereas both of her male co-stars (Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper) were paid 9%, as was director David O. Russell.
0bqy | Like other ideological constructions, representations of a society or of gender are not stable; their political and cultural importance are such that they are sites of considerable competition. As Graeme Turner has noted, 'To gain control of the representational agenda for the nation is to gain considerable power over individuals' view of themselves and each other' (Turner 1988: 136-7).
b780 | There appears to be an unspoken belief in the Hollywood film industry that somehow male-centred narratives are universally entertaining, or inherently more valuable and/or more lucrative than female-centred narratives which are seen as peculiar or of limited interest to the broad majority of viewers. This claim, of course, presupposes that certain types of narrative are inherently 'masculine' while others are 'feminine'. For example, action adventure is thought of as an essentially male genre, while romantic comedies are often described as 'chick flicks'. Tom Digby suggests that romantic comedies arise as social means of reinforcing gender oppositionality, which in turn serves the social function of reinforcing heterosexuality. The same gender oppositionality that ensures we are attracted to the opposite sex, by exaggerating the differences between men and women (and then eroticising them), also produces inter-gender mystification, which, says Digby, 'is sure to result in enough mutual aggravation between females and males to strongly reinforce oppositionality between them' (Digby 1998: 25). In other words, while romantic comedies appear only to comment upon pre-existing gender oppositionality, they in fact help to create it.
ccmb | The question for feminist film studies students is whether categorising films into 'male' and 'female' genres has to do with what real men and women enjoy, or whether different genres themselves represent stereotypes of men and women in ways that are flattering to one sex more than another. In other words, do the films create the gender-specific audiences (by appealing to, and reinforcing, social stereotypes), or are the films a mere reflection of the way nature has made us? Would male audiences still love science fiction films if the majority of them featured a central female heroine who (1) faces a threatening female/alien villain, and (2) has

nav4 | a cute 'helpful' boyfriend on the side whom she rescues?
gem8 | Would female audiences raised from childhood on strong, active, powerful images of women be different kinds of women? Would they have different expectations and tastes in the kind of 'entertainment' they consume? Would the target audience for Hollywood movies suddenly become 16-24-year-old females, who grow ever more confident in themselves and have ever more spending power? Would women suddenly be the main consumers of films in the science fiction genre? If females controlled Hollywood, is this what most science fiction films would look like? Would females actually have an opportunity to control Hollywood, because they (and their male peers) had been raised watching empowering images of females, and denigrating images of males? These are dangerous questions, because they hint at the social power interests that lie behind our myth-making industries.
e8nr | Within the film industry, the 'target audience' for big budget films is generally 16-24 -year-old males. It is as though there is some unwritten rule that says stories of interest to this group are the ones with widest human appeal.
k78w | The paucity of female directors is such that the title 'director' has become a gendered term, associated with males in the same way that the word 'surgeon' or 'pilot' or 'millionaire' connotes masculinity, although 'male' is not part of the definition of any of these terms. We do not have to specify that a director is male by adding a prefix ('male director') because the director's masculinity has become normalised, or assumed. However, we do not find it unusual to speak of 'female directors'. Here the prefix is needed to set female directors apart from the norm. Feminist theorist Claire Johnston (1980: 34) has pointed out that the female within patriarchy is seen as the irrevocable 'other'. Masculinity is the tacit 'norm' from which all deviations are defined as 'other' or 'less'.
g9du | The film director works very closely with a whole team of specialists (screenwriters, set designers, production managers, casting agents, actors, stunt men and women, editors, composers, make-up artists, effects specialists, etc.) who together collaborate to produce the final product, but the director is seen as the creator, the mastermind behind the magical process that results in the cinematic event - the final movie. As Sarah Gilligan has pointed out, 'this magical process can be seen to be coded as male' (Gilligan 2003: 16).
f682 | John Berger
li1k | First published in 1972, John Berger's Ways of Seeing was one of the twentieth century's most influential books on art. Because it appears that Berger's insights provide much of the groundwork for later feminist theorists, including Laura Mulvey, I have decided to include some of his insights in this book. Ways of Seeing was based on the BBC television series of the same name, in which Berger began to start a

dqn8 | process of questioning art, and the constructed meanings that images convey.
cop0 | For the teacher of feminist film studies the most important chapter in Berger's book is Chapter 3, dealing with the female nude. The chapter is made up of both text and images. It would be worthwhile to assign this chapter in its entirety. Alternatively, or to supplement this chapter, teachers could show a video of the BBC programme which treats this chapter as a discrete unit.
lhkq | Berger examines the usage and conventions of the European oil painting from about the late fifteenth century, in which women were the principal and ever- recurring subject. What follows is a summary of Berger's essay.
82ju | He begins by noting that the social presence of a woman is different in kind from that of a man. A man's presence depends upon the 'promise of power' which he embodies. This power may be:
y2qo | · Moral.
1piq | · Physical.
7fqw | · Temperamental.
rhaz | · Economic.
wak1 | · Social.
wtfz | · Sexual.
qy1i | The object of man's power is external to himself - a power which he exerts on others. A woman's presence expresses her own attitude to herself and defines what can and cannot be done to her. Presence to a woman is so intrinsic to her person (as an object of men's actions) that men tend to equate it with her body. To be born a woman is to be born into the keeping of men. We can still see vestiges of this in the traditional Christian wedding ceremony, in which the father, having been asked by the groom for permission to marry his daughter, officially 'gives her away' to the keeping of her husband.
1k9e | A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. From earliest childhood, she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. The surveyor and the surveyed within her are the two constituent elements of her identity as a woman. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another. Men survey women before treating them. This determines not only most relations between men and women, but also the relation of women to themselves. To recap:
5bjs | · Men act and women appear.
uodj | . Men look at women.
k16v | · Women watch themselves being looked at.
