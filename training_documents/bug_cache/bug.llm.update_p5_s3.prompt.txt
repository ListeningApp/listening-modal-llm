You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

3yxv | example, Staw and Boettger (1990) speculated that self- esteem and willingness to stand up to authority would be important personality determinants of task revision (proactive and innovative behavior that is not specified by the job). Similarly, Van Dyne et al. (1995) included global self-esteem as an important antecedent of voice in their proposed model. This is consistent with Near and Miceli (1985) and Miceli and Near (1992), who sug- gested, in their work on whistle-blowing, that low self- esteem individuals may withdraw from involvement in controversial situations and also that high self-esteem in- dividuals might be more likely to get involved in attempts to reform the situation (Near & Miceli, 1987). Although whistle-blowing is different from voice in that it focuses on alerting others to wrongdoing, it is similar to voice in that it requires initiative and nonconformance. On the ba- sis of this reasoning, we expect that group members with high self-esteem will be more proactive in engaging their environments and will be less influenced by conformity pressures than individuals with low self-esteem. Thus,
d8zj | Hypothesis 2. Global self-esteem will be positively related to voice such that individuals with high levels of global self-esteem will engage in more voice than individuals with low levels of global self-esteem.
ywxn | Situational Antecedents
uxhs | Although the discussion so far has focused on person- centered antecedents of voice, it is likely that situational factors also influence voice. Situations provide direct stimuli as well as the context for interpreting other stimuli and therefore have the potential to influence behavioral responses directly and indirectly (Hackman, 1992). Al- though a large number of situational variables could be considered in a comprehensive model of voice, the litera- ture on small groups suggests two factors that should be particularly important for predicting voice. These situa- tional factors are group size and the extent to which groups are self- versus traditionally managed.
ed6e | Group Size
6qqm | Past research demonstrates strong relationships be- tween group size and member involvement (Hackman & Vidmar, 1970; Thomas & Fink, 1963) and conformity behavior (Asch, 1956). Diffusion of responsibility tends to be positively related to the number of members in a group (Latane, 1981). In larger groups, it is difficult to identify individual members' relative contributions and therefore individuals feel less responsible for group-level outcomes. Individual members, in essence, feel more anonymous. The result is that members of large groups become less involved in group matters relative to members of smaller groups. In addition, conformity pressure in-
onum | creases with group size (Gerard, Wilhelmy, & Conolley, 1968), making it less likely that individual members will speak up and express challenging or change-oriented ideas. Because voice is proactive, discretionary, and chal- lenging, it should be especially susceptible to the diffusion of responsibility and conformity pressures of large groups. Members of large groups should feel less involved and be less willing to engage in challenging behavior (e.g., voice) than members of small groups. Accordingly, we expected
3iir | Hypothesis 3. Group size will be negatively related to voice such that individuals in smaller groups will engage in more voice than individuals in larger groups.
7a0a | Style of Management: Self- Versus Traditional Management
o1qp | Self-managed work groups are self-regulating. They perform a complete task, encourage differential member contributions based on skills and abilities, and exercise discretion over work methods and task schedules (Cum- mings, 1978). The amount of autonomy and discretion delegated to a work group influences each member's sense of involvement and responsibility (Walton & Hackman, 1986). In self-managed groups, therefore, members are likely to take "personal responsibility" and feel "person- ally accountable" for outcomes (Hackman, 1986, p. 93). Employees in self-managed groups are also linked to- gether by high levels of task interdependence and shared responsibility for group performance. Consequently, member jobs are more complex and individuals are more broadly involved in group decision making than those who work in traditional groups that function under control systems based on a hierarchy (Kemp, Wall, Clegg, & Cordery, 1983; Pearce & Ravlin, 1987; Wall, Kemp, Jack- son, & Clegg, 1986). Although research on self-managed groups is inconsistent and does not demonstrate higher overall effectiveness (Polley & Van Dyne, 1994), research has shown that self-managed groups have higher job com- plexity and that individuals in complex jobs exhibit more voice (Van Dyne, Graham, & Dienesch, 1994). On the basis of these findings, we suggest that members of self- managed work groups will be especially proactive in ex- pressing their opinions, making innovative suggestions, and developing recommendations for change. Specifically, we hypothesized
jrik | Hypothesis 4. Individuals in self-managed groups will en- gage in more voice relative to individuals in traditionally managed groups.
xv78 | Person X Situation Interactions
sdks | havior in organizations is best conceptualized as the result of interactive processes that depend on the simultaneous interplay of differences between situations and differences between individuals" (Hattrup & Jackson, 1996, p. 507), few have actually pursued this approach. Instead, re- searchers have tended to focus on either personal or situa- tional predictors. This is certainly the case in voice re- search where researchers have focused almost exclusively on individual affect ( satisfaction) and have rarely consid- ered situational factors or the interaction between person- centered characteristics and situational characteristics. Considering person-situation interactions allows identi- fication of systematic relationships that occur when the behavior of different types of individuals varies based on the situation. In the next two sections, we draw upon and extend behavior plasticity theory (Brockner, 1988) to specify the nature of Person X Situation interactions on voice behavior.
y8fb | Self-Esteem and Behavior Plasticity
521q | Research on self-esteem as a main effect has yielded weak and inconsistent results. To address this issue, Brockner (1988) developed behavior plasticity theory. This theory proposes that self-esteem moderates the rela- tionship between situational factors and individual behav- ior such that those with low self-esteem are more respon- sive to external cues (situational factors) than those with high self-esteem. Brockner gave three reasons for this relationship. First, low self-esteem individuals are less certain of their own beliefs and behaviors and are more influenced by their environments. Second, because low self-esteem individuals are dependent on others for posi- tive feedback, they respond to others by conforming in an attempt to gain approval. Finally, low self-esteem indi- viduals are especially sensitive to negative feedback. They tend to overgeneralize, apply the feedback broadly, and change their behavior in a variety of situations. In con- trast, those with high self-esteem are less influenced by situational factors and are more likely to exhibit behav- ioral autonomy.
