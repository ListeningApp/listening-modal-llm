        "content": "2zpk | Two point five Task Structure\nepu7 | As suggested by the preceding discussion, ChatGPT substantially changes the structure of writing tasks. Figure three Panel A shows that prior to the treatment, participants spend about twenty-five percent of their time brainstorming, fifty percent writing a rough draft, and twenty-five percent editing. Post-treatment, the share of time spent writing a rough draft falls by more than half and the share of time spent editing more than doubles.\n7od1 | Two point six Skill Demand\n0bqy | If ChatGPT is especially helpful to those with poor writing and communication skills relative to their other skills, it could have major labor market implications by expanding the available occupational choices and raise the earnings of individuals with strong idea-generation skills who struggle to effectively get those ideas onto paper.\nb780 | We perform several tests of this hypothesis. We construct two measures of a person's relative writing skills. First, at the beginning of the experiment, we ask participants to rank from one to three their skills at communication (writing and speaking), problem solving, and creativity. Second, in addition to assigning overall grades, evaluators separately assess each piece of output based on writing quality, content quality, and originality; the gap between a person's first-task overall score and their writing score affords another measure.\nccmb | Similarly, we construct two measures of the individual-level benefits of ChatGPT. First, at the end of the experiment, we ask treatment-group participants how much they would be willing to pay on a monthly basis to access ChatGPT in their jobs. Second, we measure how much each treatment participant's grade increases from the first to the second task. We find no clear evidence for the aforementioned hypothesis. Figure three Panel B shows that average willingness to pay for ChatGPT is flat across the terciles of both our measures of writing skill: respondents, regardless of their writing skills, are willing to pay about zero point five percent of their monthly salary for a monthly subscription to ChatGPT. Grade gains from ChatGPT are also roughly flat across both measures of relative writing skills: people with comparatively poor writing skills do not experience unusually large grade gains.\nma93 | Two point seven Job Satisfaction and Self-Efficacy\nc6hh | Access to ChatGPT could affect job satisfaction. For example, it could make participants happier by automating tedious or annoying components of the task or allowing them to finish more quickly. Alternatively, it could make the experience less enjoyable by quickly automating the most fun parts of the task. It could similarly either boost self-efficacy by giving participants access to a complex and powerful tool that enhances their capabilities, or it could lower it by making participants feel superfluous. We measure job satisfaction with a question, after each task, about how much participants enjoyed the task, and self-efficacy with a question about how skilled or effective they felt while completing the task, both on one to ten Likert scales.\ny7ea | Two point eight Beliefs About Automation\nnav4 | Many of our treated participants had never heard of or never used ChatGPT before participating in the experiment. Hence, most essentially encounter the technology for the first time and receive a crash course on its usefulness for writing tasks. How are their beliefs about future waves of automation affected by this encounter?\ngem8 | After respondents complete their second task, we elicit three beliefs, each on a one to ten scale: how worried they are about workers in their occupation being replaced by artificial intelligence; how optimistic they are that artificial intelligence will make workers in their occupation more productive; and, overall, how optimistic or pessimistic they feel about future advances in artificial intelligence. The effects of treatment on these outcomes are displayed in Figure four Panel C; worry about automation increases by zero point two six standard deviations, excitement by zero point three nine, and net optimism increases by about zero point two zero.\ne8nr | Zero point zero three seven.\nk78w | Two point nine Two-Week Followup Survey\ng9du | One indication of the value of ChatGPT to participants is whether they continue to use it after the experiment. To track whether participants are subsequently using ChatGPT in their real jobs, we resurvey them two weeks after their completion of the initial survey. This followup is still in progress, with an eighty-two percent response rate among the four hundred twenty-three respondents who have been invited so far, and no evidence of differential response rates by treatment status.\nf682 | Thirty-three percent of former treatment group participants have used ChatGPT in their job in the past week, relative to eighteen percent of control group participants. Restricting to workers who had not previously used ChatGPT when they participated in our main experiment, twenty-six percent of treated and nine percent of control workers are now using ChatGPT in their jobs. Users give it an average usefulness score of three point six five out of five point zero zero, somewhat lower than in our main experiment, likely owing to the greater length and complexity of real-world tasks. The range of tasks they report using it for is broad: generating recommendation letters for employees, responding to customer service requests, brainstorming, search-engine requests, rough-drafting emails, and so on.\nli1k | Respondents who are not using ChatGPT in their jobs mostly report that this is because the chatbot lacks context-specific knowledge that forms an important part of their writing. For example, they report that their writing is \"very specifically tailored to their customers and involves real-time information\" or \"unique and specific to their company products.\"\npbea | These comments point to an important and inherent limitation of our experiment: it involves relatively small, self-contained tasks that lack much context-specific knowledge beyond what we stipulate in the task prompts. However, our core result, that ChatGPT can increase productivity on many mid-level professional writing tasks, is supported by the fact that many respondents choose to use it in their real jobs. The fact that the treatment group is substantially more likely to use ChatGPT than the control group also suggests that the dissemination of ChatGPT into real professional activity is still in its very early stages, with many people not using it due to a lack of knowledge about or experience with the technology.\nccpt | There is no difference between the former treatment and control in their overall satisfaction with their job in the followup survey. That said, many of our respondents only started using ChatGPT in their job in the past week or two, and it may take longer for access to ChatGPT to affect overall job satisfaction.\n0fpw | Three Discussion\ndqn8 | College-educated professionals performing mid-level professional writing tasks experience substantial increases in productivity when given access to ChatGPT. The generative writing tool increases the output quality of low-ability workers while reducing their time spent, and it\ncop0 | allows high-ability workers to maintain their quality standards while becoming significantly faster. At the aggregate level, ChatGPT substantially compresses the productivity distribution, reducing inequality. It is also already being used by many workers in their real jobs. The experimental evidence suggests that ChatGPT largely substitutes for worker effort rather than complementing workers' skills, potentially causing a decrease in demand for workers, with adverse distributional effects as capital owners gain at the expense of workers.",
