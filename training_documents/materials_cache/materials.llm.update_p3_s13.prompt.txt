You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

41fx | Most of random initial structures are infeasible solu- tions, and the analytic optimization methods such as the steepest-descent method cannot escape from the infeasi- ble solution to a feasible solution. Therefore, we period- ically update the values of d(min) and d(max) depending on the network of CBs that are also renewed periodi- cally. The network is determined from the maximization problem of the number of CBs given by

n1wo | where 0 < E; is the fixed bonding affinity, nijT (CBA) is the number of common bridging atoms between the pair of atoms i and jT, N.(CBA) is the default maximum num- ber of common bridging atoms defined in Eq. (18), and q is an index for selecting ni indices of anions jT ran- domly. The third constraints define the formation ranges of CBs. The fourth constraints force cations to create CBs with the nearest ni anions. The optimization prob- lem can be solved as follows: First, all the cations create as many CBs as possible with neighboring anions, and seconds, we erase CBs with maximizing the object func- tion of Eq. (17) until all the number of common bridging atoms satisfy the second constraints. Note that two poly- hedra are linked by sharing a common vertex, a common edge, or a common face that corresponds to sharing one, two, or more than two common bridging atoms, respec- tively [24].
5bq3 | To find the optimal solutions, we solve the problems of Eqs. (2) and (17) alternately. The optimization scheme is shown in Fig. 2. A random initial structure can be infeasible solution, in fact, not all cations may not be surrounded by oxygen ions and may not have desirable coordination numbers. Besides, even if all the atoms have the desirable coordination numbers, the structure does not necessarily satisfy all the geometrical constraints such as the maximum number of common bridging atoms. Therefore, the global geometrical optimization is aimed at transforming the structure largely enough to create a different network of CBs by large Axmax. After the small number of global geometrical optimization steps,

j79f | we solve the problem of Eq. (17) once again to update the network of CBs. The mutable network and the other ge- ometrical constraints assist cations making coordination polyhedra, and accordingly, the structure is transformed into a feasible solution. If the structure satisfies the con- dition of Eq. (15), the structure is locally optimized by small Axmax to identify whether the structure can be the optimal solusion of the geometrical optimization problem given by Eq. (2). If so, the structure is the optimal so- lution of the paired optimization problems. If not, the structure is globally optimized again after annealing. The parameters of global and local optimization are detailed in Supplementary Information [33].
6tbv | To estimate the number of optimal solutions and coarsely classify the optimal solutions, we define a struc- tural fingerprint as the bundle of the fingerprints by the lists of geometrical constraints (LGCs) in dictionary or- der. LGCs are defined as what kinds of geometrical con- straints are formed with the adjacent atoms. The fin- gerprint of LGC enumerates the element symbols of the adjacent atoms linked by CBs, PCs, and ACs in dictio- nary order, respectively. Note that there is a possibility that the same structure fingerprint is assigned to differ- ent structures. For example, the fingerprint for the rutile structure and a-PbO2 is the case. See also Supplemen- tary Information [33].
xb13 | The paired mathematical programming approach is aimed at showcasting capabilities of simple rules to search structural prototypes of crystals. In this study, we in- troduce 11 kinds of cations shown in Table II to repro- duce a wide variety of coordination polyhedra. The 11 cations are selected by considering closed packed poly- hedra consisting of the centered cation and surround- ing oxygen ions, and defined by r(I), R(I), N(CB), and N(CBA), where N(CBA) is the default maximum number of common bridging atoms. We determine N(CBA) in the second constraint of Eq. (17) as
cxqi | N (CBA) = min { N(CBA) N (CBA) \ .

rut3 | Cationic radius Cn (n € N) corresponds to the mini- mum radius so that the cation can connect n oxygen ions, while CO correponds to the ionic radius of oxygen ion. They are given in Supplementary Information [33]. If the minimum and maximum cationic radii are the same, the cation is a hard sphere; if not, the cation is a soft sphere,
m3cp | because the bonding lenths can vary within the two radii.
mq4s | We apply our mathematical programming model to several compositions of cations, and find that a wide va- riety of real crystals are discovered in the optimal solu- tions by the paired mathematical programming. Table III shows the number of discovered optimal solutions for each composition, which seems to be much smaller than the number of local minima in the total energy by ab- initio simulations, and corresponding real crystals found in them. We discuss here results by focusing on aspects of the generated coordination polyhedra.
95el | The optimal solutions of HtyTmOn form a wide variety of linked-polyhedra composed of tetrahedra and octahe- dra as shown in Fig. 3. The cations T and Ht are placed in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively, in the Barrow-packings consisting of oxygen ions. Many structures are rejected from the optimal solutions by the constraints of the maximum number of common bridging atoms of T. The spinel structure has the lowest number of LGCs and highest symmetry, found as one of the opti- mal solutions for both the Ht4T208 and Ht& T4016, while the Ga2O3 structure, which is composed of 5 LGCs with the C2/m symmetry, has more LGCs and lower symme- try than the structure shown in Fig. 3(d). Real crystal structures are not necessarily the optimal solution com- posed of the lowest number of LGCs and highest sym- metry, however, they are generally good indicators to assess expectations of the structures to be realized by real crystals. The optimal solution shown in Fig. 3(c) is similar to the crystal structure of Li2 WO4; the differ- ence comes from the sizes of the unit cells. The crystal structure of Li2 WO4 is composed of large tetrahedra and octahedra around lithiums, but this structure may be re- produced by using cations Ht and T, which are placed
a0a5 | in the octahderal and tetrahedral sites in the Barrow- packings consisting of oxygens, as the optimal solution of Ht16T8O32. Figure 3(f) shows the layered structure terminated by tetrahedra and octahedra. This optimal solution is composed of the lowest number of LGCs in Ht5T3O12.
