Importantly, equation seventy-seven also establishes that in a diagrammatic expansion closed ghost loops act to cancel closed loops involving the retarded propagator. This ensures Z of J equals zero equals one, which simply reflects conservation of probability, and furthermore that correlators do not depend on the ill-defined quantity Theta of zero, reflecting the well-known fact that, for additive noise, the discretization of the stochastic differential equation (Ito, Stratonovic etc) does not matter.\nyad0 | Differentiating seventy-four with respect to J sub phi of t prime, bar zeta of tau and setting J equals zero gives, with the use of seventy-seven and recalling that integration over F tilde gives\n3g38 | F tilde goes to negative i W with respect to phi, two times d over d tau expected value of phi of t prime phi of tau minus i square root of Upsilon expected value of x tilde of tau phi of t prime plus i square root of Upsilon expected value of x tilde of t prime phi of tau equals negative i Upsilon expected value of x tilde sub in phi of tau expected value of x tilde sub in phi of t prime.\nvtbo | This is a modified Fluctuation-Dissipation relation with the term on the right-hand side accounting for the initial condition.
