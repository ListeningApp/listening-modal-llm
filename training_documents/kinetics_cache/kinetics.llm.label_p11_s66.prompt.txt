o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

0i1k | tably, the curve of rCV2 vs. promoter width for the positive- feedback genes was always above that for the genes with negative feedback or non-feedback (Figure 5B).
dqlg | Next, we investigated whether different TSS distributions affected burst frequencies and burst sizes differently. Al- though genes with 'sharp' promoters led to a higher ex- pression variability than those with 'broad' promoters for arbitrary feedback forms, burst frequencies and sizes reg- ulated by TSS distributions can exhibit significant discrep- ancy only in the absence of feedback (Figure 5C, Supple- mentary Figure S11e, f). Broad promoters led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes than sharp pro- moters (Figure 5C, red box), in agreement with the exper- imental observation that broad promoters tended to oc- cur in the case of low RNA polymerase II pause, whereas sharp promoters tended to occur in the case of high RNA polymerase II pause (84-86). These results implied that on the genome-wide scale, feedback regulations significantly weakened the impacts of TSS distributions on transcrip- tional burst kinetics.
p6pq | E-P interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedbacks
zse6 | Enhancers, DNA sequences located upstream of the pro- moter, are important regulators of eukaryotic development (87). Several lines of experimental evidence supported that E-P interactions (Figure 6A) may facilitate gene transcrip- tion (88-91) and can regulate transcriptional burst kinet-

ohh7 | ics (14,16,92-95). In addition, some studies showed that enhancer and promoter activations might require positive and negative feedback regulations, each contributing the el- ements of the protein complement required for activation of other genes (96). These results raise important questions: does the genome-wide control of burst kinetics by E-P in- teractions involves feedback regulations? If so, how do feed- backs affect burst kinetics?
vbni | To address these questions, we first recovered the inten- sities of E-P interactions from (16) and performed LOESS regression. With the involvement of feedback regulations, the modulation of variability and transcriptional burst ki- netics by E-P interactions also presents Simpson's para- dox. We then showed that, for all genes, increasing the E- P intensities led to the rise of mean gene-expression levels (Supplementary Figure S12d) but to the decline of vari- ability (rCV2) (Supplementary Figure S12e), indicating that stronger enhancers raised the expressions levels but lowered cell-to-cell variability in contrast to weaker enhancers (97). However, when distinguishing genes by feedback types, this pattern only appears in the case of positive feedback (Fig- ure 6B, Supplementary Figure S12a), implying the impor- tant role of positive feedback in E-P interactions.
dgcw | Next, we focused on burst frequencies and sizes. Previous molecular experiments and genome-wide inferences from scRNA-seq data showed that burst frequencies and sizes in- creased with promoting E-P interactions (93,94), and that enhancers mainly controlled burst frequencies (14,16,92- 95,98-100). The same conclusion was obtained when we

sk5m | performed analysis without distinguishing feedback types (Supplementary Figure S12f, g). Notably, when the feed- back types was considered, we found that as the E-P inten- sity increased, changes in burst frequencies and sizes were most apparent in the case of positive feedback (Supplemen- tary Figure S12b,c). Moreover, the slope of the line for the dependence of burst frequencies on E-P intensity was larger than that for the dependence of burst sizes on E-P inten- sity (Figure 6C). In addition, we observed that this regula- tion effect of enhancers was saturated when the E-P inter- action intensity exceeded a threshold (~40) (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S12a-c). This result indicated that the function of the enhancer was not unlimited, in agree- ment with the theoretical prediction in our previous study (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.24.477520).
qws8 | The above genome-wide results provided direct support for the fact that the control of burst kinetics by E-P inter- actions was constrained by positive feedback regulations, in accordance with previous experimental results for a small number of genes (30,101).
877u | DISCUSSION
rzhj | As the core process of life, gene transcription occurs stochastically, leading to variability in the mRNA and further protein abundances. This variability is believed to be mainly attributed to transcriptional bursting, a phe- nomenon that occurs commonly in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. From the viewpoint of biophysics, the sources of transcriptional bursting are multilevel and multiscale (1). In this study, we have developed a statistical framework of the model-driven and data-driven integration to infer dynamic feedback regulations and transcriptional bursting kinetics from static scRNA-seq data, using a mechanistic mathematical model as the connecting thread.
bfax | The mechanistic model used in our inference framework was interpretable. It captured the scRNA-seq measurement process and the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional bursting processes. We showed that not only burst frequen- cies and sizes as well as expression variability but also feed- back forms can be effectively and robustly inferred to ex- plain biophysical phenomena, which were masked in the

d52l | scRNA-seq data. Meanwhile, our inference method made the interpretable model tractable. We utilized the Gauss- Laguerre Quadrature Rules instead of the classical MCMC method to compute mRNA distribution with a high-order integral that is difficult to solve, thus making our scalable in- ference applicable on genome-wide scales. Our statistical in- ference framework laid a solid foundation for exploring the molecular mechanisms of stochastic gene expression based on single-cell data.
qlbb | Our inference method provided a powerful tool for ana- lyzing the joint effects of feedback regulation and promoter architecture and for revealing the genome-wide mechanisms of transcriptional burst kinetics. First, we found that at the same gene-expression levels, positive-feedback genes ex- hibited significantly higher gene-expression variability and higher burst frequencies as well as smaller burst sizes than negative-feedback genes on genome-wide scales. This find- ing indicated that different regulatory networks played dis- tinct roles in modulating transcriptional burst kinetics (10). Second, we revealed that the TATA box, apart from be- ing indicatives of enlarging the expression variability and raising burst sizes as suggested in previous studies (13,16), can utilize a positive feedback mechanism to increase burst frequencies. This result may explain the phenomenon that the RNA polymerase II on the TATA box gene had bet- ter localization and fewer transcriptional pauses (75,76). Third, broad promoters with multiple TSSs led to higher burst frequencies and smaller burst sizes, which were con- cealed by the feedback regulations. Finally, we showed that enhancer-promoter interactions modulated burst kinetics and primarily controlled burst frequency in the presence of positive feedback. All these results were obtained un- der the hidden hypothesis that the intrinsic behaviors of the different gene were statistically identical. Overall, these genome-wide evidences indicated that transcriptional burst kinetics was not only encoded by static promoter archi- tectures but also constrained by dynamic gene regulatory networks.
nhsg | Our inference framework based on the model-driven and data-driven combination was an extensible one for study- ing the general principles of transcriptional bursting. First, gene expression variability caused by transcriptional bursts

4jmz | comes not only from technical noise and feedback regula- tion as described in our hierarchical model, but also from many other potentially complex mechanisms, such as RNA polymerase II recruitment and pause release <LATEX>\left( 1 0 2 - 1 0 5 \right) ,</LATEX> alternative splicing (106,107), post-transcriptional regula- tions via mRNA degradation (108) and nuclear retention (109), chromatin movement (110), etc. (111-114), which all may affect burst kinetics. Second, promoter architecture can be described by a multi-state model since a transcription process would involve many molecular steps (115,116). It is unclear whether the multi-state architecture is more de- scriptive than the two-state model. Determining the num- ber of gene states and studying the effect on burst kinet- ics is a long-term effort. Third, our hierarchical model only considered self-regulatory feedback (117), the simplest feed- back form. More complex regulatory forms may exist in gene-expression systems (118). However, since they reflect high-level structure regulation (10), more complex yet rea- sonable mathematical models and more powerful inference methods need to be developed for better studying tran- scriptional burst kinetics. Fourth, most of the traditional models of gene expression were based on the Markov hy- pothesis (69,119). In organisms, however, the processes of molecular synthesis may be non-Markovian, and increas- ing time-resolved data have verified the extensive existence of molecular memory (120,121). Therefore, it is necessary to extend Markov models to non-Markov ones (122-124). But this is a great challenge to numerical solutions and sta- tistical inferences. Finally, we point out that choosing a suit- able model involves trade-off problems since more complex models would bring less consensus on general principles of transcriptional bursting (4).
b7cq | Finally, studying transcriptional burst kinetics may start with a data-driven approach as done in our statistical in- ference framework. Our predictions of burst kinetics us- ing scRNA-seq data were based on the assumption that the abundances of mRNA and protein were highly dependent (65). Recently, more and more studies of sequencing meth- ods have paid attention to measuring the profiles of multi- type molecules in single-cell levels, such as simultaneous quantification of intracellular mRNA and protein (125), which can better describe cell states (126). For feedback loop types our method predicted, we found that many genes have been confirmed by biological experiments (Supple- mentary Table S1). Moreover, the identification of feedback loops can be more convincing by using multimodal data combined with scRNA-seq such as ENCODE (127) and some automated packages (128). In addition, time-resolved data can provide more information compared to static data. We believe that with the continuous progress in measure- ment technologies, time-resolved single-cell data will be pri- mary means to study the transcription burst kinetics in the future (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.19.496754). Mean- while, spatial transcriptome multimodal data (129-132) and chromatin structural data (133) provided good opportuni- ties for in-depth studies of burst kinetics. Analysis of those multimodal single-cell data or integrated data can help us discover more credible biological knowledge but would also bring challenges for developing statistical methods to infer dynamic molecular mechanisms masked in static single-cell data.
