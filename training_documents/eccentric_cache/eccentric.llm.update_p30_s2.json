        "content": "2nib | Early analytical and experimental studies demonstrated that all of the links above the level of the column under consideration would not develop their maximum shear forces simultaneously. Based on this observation a lower overstrength factor was suggested by AISC three hundred forty-one dash ten for the capacity design of columns in EBFs of three or more stories of bracing, when compared with the Q two value used in the design of brace members. Columns also need to be checked for the amplified seismic axial force of Q twenty P E Q, where twenty is the structural overstrength factor taken as two point zero per ASCE seven dash ten and P E Q is the column axial force generated by the code-specified earthquake loads. It is important to note that drift-induced flexural forces are generally neglected in the design of columns as permitted by AISC three hundred forty-one dash ten.\nnaev | During the design process, it is necessary to estimate link end moments in order to determine the internal force distribution after formation of the expected plastic mechanism. For links located in the middle portion of floor beams (internal links) the end moments will almost be equal throughout a seismic loading. On the other hand, for links connected to columns (external links) the end moments will not be identical in the elastic range. However, early studies of Kasai and Popov proved that for most cases these moments would equalize as the link goes through large plastic rotations. Thus, in both cases, the link end moments can be readily estimated using equilibrium. The only exception reported by Kasai and Popov was the case of external links with p less than or equal to one point three, for which the end moments did not equalize at the ultimate state. For such cases, recommendations for moment distribution were developed by these researchers. Kasai and Popov also demonstrated that it is\n7h0h | advantageous to avoid EBF configurations with inactive links (e.g. Figure one f) in which only one of the links located at one end of a brace would dissipate most of the energy (and thus become active) while the other would not contribute notably to the energy dissipation of the system (and thus remain inactive).\na64c | It is worth mentioning that early multi-story tests demonstrated that, in some cases, the plastic behavior could be concentrated in the first story links leading to the development of a soft story mechanism. Popov et al. attributed this issue to the incorrect proportioning of the links along the height of the EBFs in the above-mentioned tests. The static pushover and dynamic time-history analyses of Kasai and Popov, Ricles and Popov, Ricles and Bolin, and Popov et al. revealed that in order to achieve a reasonable distribution of link inelastic action throughout an EBF height, all of the links need to have uniform capacity-to-demand ratios.\ngi7n | Five point two. Research on Seismic Performance\n3pn1 | An enormous amount of research on the seismic performance and design of EBF systems has been conducted in the past decades and important aspects of this research are briefly discussed in this section.\nwjuz | In a series of studies by Koboevic and her colleagues in late nineteen nineties and twenty tens the seismic behavior of low, mid, and high-rise EBF systems was investigated under several earthquake records via nonlinear time-history analysis. Similar to previous findings, limited yielding in EBF beams was found acceptable provided that braces were capable of resisting the additional moments. The use of a higher overstrength factor in the capacity design of upper tier columns was recommended, which is the approach used in CSA S sixteen dash fourteen. The importance of drift-induced column flexural forces was also demonstrated in the above studies. The last observation was reported previously by Kasai and Han as well. An iterative design methodology based on selecting appropriate earthquake records and performing time-history analyses was also outlined by these researchers. Although all of the links in the studied EBFs had similar capacity-to-\n3yxv | demand ratios, the numerical results revealed that the energy dissipation might be non-uniform along the EBF height and more concentrated in the first and last story links.\nd8zj | The seismic behavior of six-story one-bay EBFs with long links under several earthquake records was studied by Tirca and Gioncu in nineteen ninety-nine. It was concluded that long links should be used with caution and avoided as much as possible due to their poor performance as observed in some of the studied cases.\nywxn | The effect of shear-moment interaction in the plastic design of EBFs was studied by Mastrandrea et al., where a procedure for determining the ultimate link shear force and link end moments was proposed for a given collapse mechanism. In companion studies, a design methodology for EBFs was developed which ensures formation of a global mechanism and prevents partial or local collapse mechanisms. The behavior of EBFs designed with this method was compared to that of EBFs designed using a simplified method proposed by Kasai and Han and satisfactory results were reported. Further nonlinear static and dynamic analyses were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in distributing the inelastic link action through an EBF height while preventing the occurrence of undesirable failure modes. The method was also verified via incremental dynamic analysis in a study by Mastrandrea et al. in twenty thirteen. The above-mentioned plastic mechanism control theory was recently implemented in the design of dual EBFs (i.e. systems composed of EBFs and moment-resisting frames) by Montuori et al.\nuxhs | In two thousand six, Köber and Stefanescu compared the seismic behavior of EBFs designed on the basis of four different specifications including AISC three hundred forty-one dash zero two and Eurocode eight dash two thousand two using nonlinear time-history analysis. It was reported that AISC three hundred forty-one dash zero two required heavier sections for columns, beams, and braces. In a companion study by these researchers the positive and negative aspects of placing webs of I-shaped braces normal or parallel to the plane of EBFs were investigated. Recommendations regarding each configuration were given considering seismic performance and required amounts of steel. In two thousand nine, Köber and Stefanescu investigated the effects of using different structural details at the plastic hinge locations near the bottom of the first story columns in EBFs. Numerical results pointed to the advantages of utilizing a detail with reduced column flanges at these locations.\ned6e | The effects of frame geometry on the seismic behavior and weight of chevron EBFs were investigated in two thousand eight by Özhendekci and Özhendekci. It was concluded that EBFs with shear links performed better than those with intermediate and moment links. Furthermore, the use of longer shear links and shorter intermediate links was found to be advantageous in terms of seismic performance. However, it was demonstrated that for shear links, the frame weight would also increase along with the link length.",
