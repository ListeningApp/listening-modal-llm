From this figure, it has been found that the relationships between log left parenthesis E sub s e c over F left parenthesis e right parenthesis right parenthesis and log left parenthesis sigma sub v c prime right parenthesis for each strain level and sand can be approximated as a straight line. Accordingly, the secant Young's modulus of isotropic NC sand specimens can be explained by an exponent function of the\n4jmz | effective vertical stress at any strain level, as in the case of small strains.\nb7cq | shows the stress dependency of the friction angle at failure for isotropic NC specimens. It has been found that the stress dependency of Quiou sand is larger than that of Toyoura and Ticino sands. In particular, the friction angle of Quiou sand decreases rapidly with an increase in the confining pressure. This is because the crushability of Quiou sand is higher than that of other sands. Therefore, the n-value of Quiou sand decreased for\n0b39 | eight sub a greater than zero point zero five percent Consolidation Stress Ratio\nqecd | The secant modulus decrease with an increase in the strain level is more pronounced in K sub zero consolidated left parenthesis K sub zero C right parenthesis specimens than in isotropic consolidated IC specimens, as mentioned before.\n```",
