In economic versions of such models, elites create extractive institutions to ensure their rents, even if these institutions slow growth for the economy as a whole. Although oversimplified, these models are useful in highlighting the pivotal role of domestic elite participation in potential upgrading coalitions and the ways in which elite privileges can discourage such engagement.\nm3cp | One obstacle to such participation involves a form of entrenchment in which longer periods in middle-income status allow large firms and elite social groups to consolidate their positions in the economy and the polity. The domestic firms-mostly huge, conglomerated, family-owned business groups-that grew large in the late twentieth century were concentrated in commodities (natural resources, basic metals, and other semiprocessed goods), regulated sectors (especially banking and utilities), natural oligopolies (such as cement and beer), and occasionally, low-tech manufacturing (having been boxed out of high-tech manufacturing by multinational corporations). They were already very large and powerful coming into the twenty-first century. In contrast to business groups in countries that escaped the middle-income trap, these concentrated business groups have had little to gain from pushing for policies that would help their economies break out of the trap. They are entrenched in their own traditional business strategies and in politics and wield power to maintain institutions favorable to their existing businesses.\nmq4s | Inequality also impedes upgrading policies and institutions through the more explicitly political mechanisms of clientelism and populism. Clientelism-exchanges of particularistic goods (patronage) between wealthy and poor or powerful and powerless-thrives under conditions of poverty and inequality. To the extent patronage runs through the public administration, it undermines bureaucratic capacity, encourages particularistic ties between state officials and private sector groups, and\n95el | MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP\na0a5 | diverts resources to unproductive spending. The overall result is that clientelism undercuts programmatic politics and thereby displaces upgrading goals from partisan and electoral politics. The phenomenon does, of course, also exist in low-income countries, but the political effects in middle-income countries are more debilitating, as they fragment politics and reduce the possibility that upgrading coalitions will emerge.\ngocl | Inequality also makes politics more prone to populism, understood here in economic terms as some form of personalistic leadership that addresses broad but unorganized discontent by undertaking unsustainable redistribution through mechanisms like price controls, consumption subsidies, inflation, and exchange rate overvaluation. Among large middle-income countries, such distortions have recently been especially marked in Argentina, Thailand, and Venezuela. Recent cases vary, but economic populism encourages short-term, ad hoc policy-making, antagonizes significant portions of business, and weakens rather than builds institutions. Moreover, at some point economic populism ends badly-in recession and crisis, which siphon off resources from policy priorities that could have been used to escape the middle-income trap. Populism, although not inevitable in middle-income countries, is more likely to occur there because it draws crucial support from the urban informal sector that grew large in the transition to middle-income status.\nob1z | INFORMALITY\nm4cb | Following what is known as the \"Lewis turning point,\" earlier developers usually transited out of informality with the shift out of agriculture; urban workers quickly became formal workers, whose rising wages stimulated investments in skills as the supply of surplus labor was exhausted. Historical estimates are hard to come by, but scattered evidence suggests informality was much less of a factor for earlier industrializers as they transitioned to high income, in part because manufacturing accounted for a larger share of the economy than it does in today's middle-income countries that are suffering premature deindustrialization. For European countries, the shadow economy was about eight to twelve percent in Germany in the late nineteen seventies, eight percent in Denmark in nineteen eighty, three to six percent in France in the late nineteen seventies, thirteen to fourteen percent in Sweden in nineteen seventy-eight, ten to twenty-seven percent in Spain in nineteen seventy-nine to eighty, and twenty to thirty-five percent in Italy in nineteen seventy-nine. The informal workforce in Korea was seven percent in nineteen ninety-three.\nu2ob | Most middle-income countries have been waiting a long time for Lewis's turning point and are instead characterized by a massive and relatively stable shift out of rural informality into urban informality, sometimes abetted by inflows of migrant labor. The shadow economies of large middle-income countries are nearly double those of high-income countries. For a different measure, informal employment is even higher-forty-four percent-for our large middle-income countries. Informal workers are a heterogeneous lot, but the vast majority of them labor in precarious low-skill, low-wage, low-productivity employment.\n2gnm | These high levels of informality are especially striking for having persisted despite growth and rising wages. In all nine large middle-income countries, the shadow economy actually increased from nineteen ninety-nine to two thousand seven. Indeed, many of the sources economists identify as contributing to informality-excessive labor-market regulation, outsourcing and contract work, weak enforcement capacity, and premature deindustrialization-are not moving in directions that would reduce informality in middle-income countries. Further, high levels of informality are correlated empirically with high levels of inequality, which as noted remain stubbornly high in large middle-income countries.\nemgw | The informal-formal distinction constitutes a crucial cleavage within\nxaqt | MIDDLE-INCOME TRAP\n5rcb | the labor force that involves, among other things, divergent policy interests. Because, for example, formal sector workers have longer job tenure and benefit from on-the-job training for specific skills, they have an interest in greater subsidies for in-firm training. By contrast, informal workers, who shift jobs every few years, would prefer investment in vocational schools offering general training. Frank-Borge Wietzke also emphasizes differing interests in labor-market policy. Outsiders with insecure work contracts prefer employment generating \"active\" labor-market policies, for example, public employment centers, labor-market training, and subsidized employment. Insiders focus on the security of their contracts, worker protection, and lower public spending on employment policies. Although the interest cleavages between formal and informal are often attenuated by movements of workers between sectors over time, it is nonetheless rare to see organized coalitions that incorporate both insiders and outsiders.\n524j | The electoral strategies of parties and politicians can deepen these labor-market cleavages and reinforce the divergence in preferences between workers in the informal sector and workers in the formal sector. Some parties, for example, use segmented strategies by appealing to poor voters with clientelist, individual benefits, on the one hand, and to richer groups with programmatic appeals, on the other hand. In essence, this segmentation allows parties to ignore the programmatic interests of the poor. At a minimum, the strategy further fragments\n```",
