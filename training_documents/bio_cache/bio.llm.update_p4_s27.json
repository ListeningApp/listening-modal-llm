To minimize bias in our searches, we chose keywords that were either neutral (fourteen of nineteen keywords) or identified general or specific known negative impacts (three keywords, i.e., displacement, eviction, and cost) and keywords related to measures of restitution or general positive impacts (two keywords, i.e., compensation and benefit). We refined our search further by focusing on\niwn5 | the following research areas: environmental sciences and ecology, biodiversity conservation, forestry, sociology, anthropology, government law, ethnic studies, and social issues. We also entered the search terms in Google Scholar and reviewed the first five hundred results. We purposefully excluded the substantial body of non-peer-reviewed studies on social impacts of PAs because of potential biases and lack of detailed statistical analysis within much of this material. Peer-reviewed studies were only selected if we could clearly identify impacts on local communities resulting from a protected area.\nuooz | Our initial search yielded one thousand six hundred thirty-five studies. Inclusion in our final selection required studies to meet precise criteria. To be included, studies had to have assessed the impacts of a specific, named PA. The impacts could have resulted directly from PA policies, such as hunting regulations, or indirectly, such as through increased tourism to the PA. Impacts also had to be directly linked by the authors to the presence of a PA and its\n```",
