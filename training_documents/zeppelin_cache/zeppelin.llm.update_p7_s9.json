        "content": "06ht | What the cock rock indictment significantly overlooks is that many women were Zeppelin fans, found the male musicians attractive, and responded to the sexual overtones of the songs as much as any boy or man buying the records or attending the concerts. Though Led Zeppelin had never been a teenybopper act of winsome youngsters like their contemporaries the Osmonds or the Bay City Rollers, teenyboppers had older sisters and in time grew up themselves, and chaste fantasies of doe-eyed Donny or Woody evolved into more explicit ones of sweaty Robert or mysterious\nv3r2 | But in the Long Run\nnv42 | Jimmy. Cock rock worked both ways: the performers expressed it (Mick Jagger rode an inflatable oversize phallus during the Rolling Stones' nineteen seventy-five US tour), and both sexes in the audience encouraged it. Though there were probably many women put off by Led Zeppelin's overt machismo and crushing rhythms, preferring the sensitive tones of a James Taylor or a Van Morrison, or instead identifying with the lyrics of a Joni Mitchell or a Carole King, there were still plenty happy to find in Zeppelin a larger-than-life eroticism the musicians could not help but convey. For a term intended as a rebuke, Zeppelin's \"cock rock\" was sometimes exactly what listeners wanted to see and hear.\nxags | Airwaves to Heaven: Led Zeppelin as AOR Band\njc47 | The band was one, but not intentionally. The group's debut in nineteen sixty-eight was in part planned around the rise of \"free-form\" FM radio in North America, stations that broadcast music far removed from the sanctioned two-minute ditties of their AM rivals. In the nineteen sixties the coolest FM outlets might play extended sides of jazzer Sun Ra, avant-gardist Captain Beefheart, or sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar; or choose from among the best new tracks by Iron Butterfly, the Band, or Jimi Hendrix; it was these stations that the young baby boomers turned to when seeking out the most progressive sounds. FM came through in stereo, as well, adding a new dimension to the already expanding home sound systems proliferating in the basements, dorm rooms, and campus pubs of the era. At the time of Led Zeppelin's appearance such stations were considered \"underground,\" but into the next decade the format was popular enough to be reconfigured into \"Album-Oriented Radio\" or \"Album-Oriented Rock.\" \"FM radio was just beginning to have a huge influence,\" John Paul Jones acknowledged of Zeppelin's initial marketing mediums. \"They weren't afraid to play longer tracks or even whole albums. We went around to a lot of radio stations to plug the record.\" Publicist Danny Goldberg added that \"rock stations like WCBN in Boston, KMET in LA, and KSAN in San Francisco really made Zeppelin very big, very fast.\"\nko3c | AOR was both the expression and the basis of a music industry whose prime product had become the long-playing thirty three-rpm record. Audiences were now affluent enough to afford the discs in large numbers, competing with (though not completely eliminating) the market for forty five-rpm singles. Both rock artists and rock audiences came to revere the album format as a more personal or serious art, less constricted by the time and content regulations of AM, and the most important rock albums were compared\nxek3 | Led Zeppelin FAQ\nbbpr | to the most important novels, plays, or films of older generations. To Peter Grant and Led Zeppelin, AOR was the perfect complement to their strategy of album-only releases, where the quartet's AM-friendliest singles (\"Communication Breakdown\" or \"Immigrant Song\") were no more helpful to the bottom line than the longer album cuts featured on FM (\"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Stairway to Heaven,\" or \"Kashmir\").\n5zyf | But from the middle of the nineteen seventies onward, AOR became synonymous with a smug and cynical business culture that was a natural product of rock's billion-dollar revenues. Staple AOR acts such as Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles were derided as spoiled prima donnas disconnected from the day-to-day lives of their middle-class fans, and fresh AOR additions like Boston, Styx, Journey, Kansas, and Supertramp seemed to have been specifically crafted for the highbrow pretensions of listeners raised on Abbey Road, Dark Side of the Moon, or Tommy. Drug-based corruption was endemic between record labels and disc jockeys, with cocaine replacing payola as the standard currency of greased palms; AOR playlists shrank to almost exclusively white rosters, the occasional exception being a song from Jimi Hendrix or Stevie Wonder (some called it Apartheid-Oriented Radio). \"Through AOR,\" noted ninety ninety-five's Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll, \"FM radio became almost as, and some would argue substantially more, conservative than the AM radio of the Sixties to which FM had been an alternative... AOR music, which is now termed 'classic rock,' is played all the time because it's popular; it remains popular because it's played all the time.\"\n9own | As anyone who has listened to a local classic rock radio station for an hour or so will confirm, Led Zeppelin was an early pillar of AOR airplay and has been ever since. This was a good thing for the band while they were making records, but since their demise the prevalence of the fistful of Zeppelin cuts in heavy rotation on FM radio-\"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"Ramble On,\" \"Black Dog,\" \"Over the Hills and Far Away,\" and, notoriously, \"Stairway to Heaven\"-has misrepresented their overall canon and gotten them lumped them in with a range of other acts and tracks whose familiarity has muted their original appeal. Today the inescapable AOR classic \"Stairway to Heaven\" is reviled as much as it's revered, in company with the Who's \"Won't Get Fooled Again,\" the Rolling Stones' \"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\" AC/DC's \"Back in Black,\" plus Boston, Styx, Kansas, Journey, Supertramp, Fleetwood Mac, and the Eagles. On their own, all of these are fine works and fine musicians whose continued fame is justified, but repeated ad infinitum on AOR they have suffered grievous overexposure. What began as a trade term subsequently became a derogatory epithet, and Led Zeppelin and other artists have been tarred by association.\nbqfb | But in the Long Run\nwwdt | A Minute Seems like a Lifetime: How \"Classic Rock\" Radio Represents Led Zeppelin\nmn1r | Since the early nineteen eighties Album-Oriented Radio has been transformed into classic rock, a programming format devoted to the rock music of roughly nineteen sixty-six to nineteen eighty-AOR frozen in time. Just as it was in the nineteen seventies, Led Zeppelin has been prominent on classic rock stations, and the broadcasters have played a large part in the band's continued popularity with generations too young to remember them from their heyday. Whereas many of Zeppelin's onetime peers on the charts and tour circuits have been relegated to the oldies, \"soft favorites,\" or \"where are they now\" categories (say, Three Dog Night, Paul Simon, Stealers Wheel, or Van Morrison), Zeppelin are thriving on classic rock stations, where the children and perhaps even grandchildren of their original fans can still catch their hits at all hours of the day. Because of classic rock radio, Led Zeppelin's posthumous releases, such as the box sets of nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety-three, the BBC Sessions of nineteen ninety-seven, and the Mothership collection of two thousand seven, have all found ready markets. By maintaining Zeppelin's favored status on its airwaves (and offering syndicated shows like Get the Led Out and other Zep-focused program blocks), classic rock has been the group's best marketing vehicle for some thirty years.",
