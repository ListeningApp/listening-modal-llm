You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

a82c | The psychological mechanism exists whereby an individual can convince himself that he was really trying to do something other than he really was, so that he can harvest the 'success'; and this is equally true of societies.
u2j3 | Human progress is slowed down or halted when people aim for evident success (success measured by what people can easily describe as success) and lose impetus for success of in- tention.
tnhu | Example: 'False Success' :-
yki0 | When Mulla Nasrudin, falling off his donkey and laughed at as a result by schoolboys, says: I meant to fall off, anyway'.
lsai | Example: 'True success' :-
i5g8 | When a team of doctors succeeded in inoculating a whole popula- tion against some endemic organism, whether or not the inhabi- tants think they are performing a magical ritual.
hdi4 | Example: 'Possible ingredient of success, not essential to it": - When some, or even all, of the inoculated people learn the back- ground and purpose of the inoculation.
ofyw | Sufi Organisations
hzyo | Q: Can you say anything about Sufi organisations, today and yesterday?
j7i8 | A: Sufi organisations come into being from time to time. Among their purposes is the attraction, concentration and transmission of certain perceptions.
ilpe | These organisations may or may not have what is ordinarily taken in conventional societies to be an outwardly spiritual or 'esoteric' shape.
ulbc | This surface aspea is not necessarily important.
7nzf | A major objective of Sufi activity is sometimes expressed as aiding the human transformation process.
uuws | This process can take place only if the organisation, visible, identifiable or otherwise, is adequately attuned to the human being.
ruhe | This attunement itself may impose 'unlikely' externals upon an organisation.
p7y3 | All such entities are temporary forms. When they have com- pleted their effective lifespan, others take their place.
kxtt | The outward form or husk may, however, persist and contrive to perform social or other comparatively less significant functions. The inheritors of these forms seldom, if ever, realise that the entity is 'organically dead'.
qdy5 | This is why almost the last place in which to seek the continua- tion of a transmission such as the one being discussed is in apparently well-established traditionalistic bodies. These are more efficiently described as archaeological relics, easily recognisable as such by those who know their original extent, purpose and vitality.
wl6l | They develop a sort of quasi-adaptability, or else a rigidity - or a combination of these. The consequence of these characteristics is to cause them either to seek support from new formulations or else to try to fight them. They always, however, lack real adaptability, consistent with contemporary needs.
60q4 | This peculiarity arises when there is a pre-occupation with preservation of archaic, anachronistic forms. Effective higher teaching, in contrast, always seeks to employ any form within which it can complete its mission.
mwhj | THE CAUSE AND THE EFFECT
t8dw | Understanding Sufi organisations involves knowing what lies be- hind appearances. As Rumi says in his Fihi ma Fihi, 'In it what is in It':
jmsn | If a sleeve moves, the hand has moved it. But if the hand moves, the sleeve does not need to move, necessarily. So, if you look at the caused and do not know the cause, you imagine that 'sleeve' is something with a life of its own!
xkyp | Not even a King is immune from the rule that people jump to conclusions based on superficialities. This can happen with tech- nology in the scientifically-based West:
yciz | The English King Edward VII saw a hissing vehicle lurch- ing towards him. "What the devil is that?' he exclaimed, then gasped: 'Good God! It is the Devil!'
7zau | But it was a motor-car .. *

qnju | Coming Together
os43 | Q: What is the harmonisation- of a community through what is called the 'Coming-Together' method?
qhwz | A: The Kernel of the visible aspect called 'Sufism' is the basic human unit: the members who meet together and carry on the studies prescribed for them by a contemporary teacher.
c6j3 | This is necessary to the realisation which comes from being a Sufi. It may be called community, communion, meeting. It is unimportant what it is called, what is important is to see how every form of human search which later becomes a system, a 'religion', or an enterprise of any kind, originally depends upon this coming-together. It is often called the Jam - coming together; pronounced as if to rhyme with 'hum'.
ekpe | Meeting for worship, teamwork of all kinds, learning in groups, all are derivations and usually diluted ones, of this basic factor.
mdf3 | It is the Sufis, the real Sufis, who preserve the original means of operating in this Jam. As time passes, in ordinary communities without special safeguards, the working of this coming-together becomes less and less effective, more and more formalised or generalised, until the Jam no longer exists. What takes its place is social 'togetherness', or emotional enthusiasm, or conditioned response to being in a collection of people.
11go | No higher attainment is possible to man unless the circumstances of the coming-together are correct; unless it is a communion including the right people, at the right time, in the right place. Impatience, ignorance, sentimentality, intellectualism tend to cause people to convert the true 'Jam' situation until it becomes some- thing else.
19zj | This essential knowledge has always existed amongst humanity, and continues to exist. But superficial and in general popularised thinking have obscured the real working of this coming-together, until people can only see innumerable forms of deteriorated 'Jam' - which they accept or reject according to whether they seem
7jjp | attractive, plausible or 'true'.
fad3 | It may often be impossible to re-form a degenerated coming- together community. It will then be possible to regenerate it only by breaking old habit-patterns and regrouping people who can really be harmonised. This may cause a very different - and perhaps unacceptable - appearance of the whole effort to those who have become accustomed to a false situation. The selection of participants on the basis of their capacity and not their assumed importance always causes discontent in those who have lost the power to adapt. This kind of lack of flexibility is, in turn, an inevitable characteristic of people and groups which have been running on automatistic patterns and which need revivifying.
0xob | It is an evident fact that true communities and organisations 'run down' and develop peculiarities other than were present in their origins. They may do this because of the ascendancy of undesirable characteristics in the participants, or because there is a widespread tendency for people and groups to attempt to stabilise themselves by using the nearest available organisation, irrespective of whether this kind of stabilisation loses more than it gains.
h8ua | This is the major perennial reason for the cyclic emergence of living teachers. It is they alone who can restore harmony and balance in circles and individuals which have sacrificed these things in the search for continuity and reassurance in the hope of stabili- sation.
si8j | Were it possible to attain the object in a systematised way, the means to do so would have been enunciated and recorded many thousands of years ago: just as the laws of ordinary material stability and performance are recorded and employed in physics or in applied arts.
1yw9 | The reactions of an audience to the efforts of a real teacher to redress the balance of an organisation are always predictable. They will include despair, confusion, desire for stimulus, fear that some- thing might be taken away, rejection, and a desire to accept in order to profit by the 'new phase'.
v9d9 | THE SHIP IN A STORM
p3pr | Mulla Nasrudin objected to the captain of a ship making fast the sails aloft, when as he said: 'Can't you see that the trouble is at sea-level !'
vjoz | The teacher, however much he may regret it, can never escape the necessity of saying that it is he who has the technical know- ledge: who decides whether the sails or the hull have to be attended to.
