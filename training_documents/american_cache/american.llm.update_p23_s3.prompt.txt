You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.

j30a | Like the Federalist language reformer Noah Webster, Morse sought to achieve a degree of national identity by aligning the overall practices of alphabetic training with geographical knowledge. Given the program- matic rethinking of elementary literacy instruction, the map became a product of alphabetic learning. Indeed, as the basic principles of literacy (the alphabet, representational sign systems, phonetics) became imbri- cated with basic principles of geography (notions of place, systems of measurement, taxonomic organization), the conventional words and ver- bal text were perceived through a geographic consciousness. By prefacing
7bdk | his textbook with a map of the new nation-state, Morse invariably coupled the map reader's desire for visual self-location to the textbook's otherwise verbal representation of political identities. Students following the read- ing protocol of the textbook map, then, learned not only to privilege the geographic dimension of the nation-state over representations of local places but also to superimpose the cartographic signs representing the union over the textbook's alphabetic notations describing the states. Thus, while Webster relied on the national map to Americanize the spell- ing and pronunciation of English words, Morse's map-reading lesson transformed the study of geography into a nationalistic spelling bee.28
fim0 | Federalists like Webster and Morse who used the rhetoric of the na- tional map operated inside an established cartographic tradition in which maps had historically accompanied the creation of national ideologies. Ever since Abraham Ortelius and Gerard Mercator published their world maps and atlases in the sixteenth century, single-sheet maps had pre- sented the sovereign states as visually and territorially unified constructs. During the eighteenth century, the wealthier European nation-states had sponsored or were about to initiate the production of national maps. Developing out of the discourses of property surveys and regional map- ping projects, the national map served a dual function. First, in the map- making process, surveyors left visible markers on the land (such as bound- ary markers and border crossings). Second, the map image as a material artifact provided a visual proxy and reproducible evidence of the nation's territorial, optically organic, and demonstrably material existence.29
ojro | 28. Morse's choice of map here reflects the way in which child psychologists describe the cultural construction of national identity. In their study "The Transition from Ego- centricity to Reciprocity," Jean Piaget and Anne Marie Weil seek to establish "the develop- ment in children of the idea of the Homeland and the Relations with other Countries." While they approach their test subjects from the positions of the cognitive (when does the notion of country become reality?) and the affective (when do evaluative attributes such as loyalty and patriotism emerge?), both authors presuppose the knowledge of geographic images like school maps. See Sarah F. Campbell, ed., Piaget Sampler: An Introduction to Jean Piaget through His Own Words (New York, 1976), 37-58.
l6t9 | 29. On the mapping projects in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century absolutist Euro- pean nation-states, see James C. Scott, Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (New Haven, Conn., 1998); Norman J. W. Thrower, Maps and Civilization: Cartography in Culture and Society (Chicago, 1996), 91-124; Josef W. Kon-
1ujy | In the first decades of the United States' existence, the image of the national map was one of the few visual artifacts demonstrating what many perceived to be either an abstract or even untenable fiction, namely that there could be a national union between disjointed regions and politically disparate people. Unlike in Europe, where governments controlled the output of national maps, in the United States the national map quickly became the dual product of the federal government and the private eco- nomic sector. On the one hand, the federal government sponsored the production of national maps on two occasions. The passage of the Land Ordinance Acts of 1785 and 1787 anticipated a burst of mapmaking ac- tivities as it launched a national survey. The copyright law of 1790, which was advertised on the inside of every book printed in the United States as "an Act . . . securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books," protected maps by giving them the status of a preferred commodity.
qzor | On the other hand, the appearance of a state-regulated distribution of national maps would be misleading because the majority of maps and other geographical writings were produced by private individuals and small commercial publishers. The new citizens were most likely to en- counter the image of the nation by reading inexpensive, small-scale maps, like the one inserted in Morse's school geography. The map image of the United States proliferated significantly when publishers like Mathew Carey of Philadelphia included national maps in various book genres and through multiple packaging reduced significantly the average price per map. According to Carey's sales catalog of 1795, single-sheet maps sold for as little as twelve and a half cents (by comparison, the folio edition of the American Atlas, containing twenty-one maps, was priced at five dollars-six if "coloured"). These numbers show that single-sheet maps rather than map collections were affordable texts and as such quickly absorbed into the nation's cultural landscape.30
a0by | Indeed, the national map permeated American material culture in many and unexpected places. For example, after the Revolution families like that of Mrs. Noah Smith not only displayed their material belongings (and thus good taste) when they posed for portraits but opted to have the
u1ky | map of the United States close to the portrait's center to better demon- strate their new Americanness (Figure 33). Considering the domestic habit of putting maps on display inside private settings, the national map in all likelihood decorated the walls of American homes (Figure 34). The nation's map image certainly became a pedagogic piece of furniture in schools. It was a fundamental part of textbooks, globes, and wall decora- tions. Teachers and parents even experimented with the cognitive func- tion of the national map by integrating it into didactic puzzles (Figure 35). Once we leave the domestic and institutional spaces of the home and the school, we discover that the nation's cartographic shape hung on rollers or under glass in public places. Wall maps were displayed in public offices and coffeehouses; as the genre painting Barroom Dancing by John Lewis Krimmel shows, the national map was displayed in taverns, where it func- tioned as decoration, conversation piece, and metaphoric touchstone of communal identity (Figure 36).31
htm9 | A spate of American-made atlases greatly popularized the image of the nation-state. Beginning with the publication of Mathew Carey's American Atlas (1795), four more national atlases almost simultaneously captured the public eye: Carey's General Atlas (1796), Carey's American Pocket Atlas (1796), Joseph T. Scott's Atlas of the United States (1796), and John Reid's American Atlas (1796). Each of these atlases privileged the national map. While the atlas as a printed form imitated the generic design of a book, the map showing the territory of the United States often functioned like a table of contents or prefatory chapter. Placed in this position, the national map more than introduced the states; in most cases it emphasized na- tional unity over state autonomy.
