Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

d09o | GC analysis of hydroxylation reactions with 2 revealed only a single product, which was identified by comparison to an au- thentic standard as the alcohol 2a. No peaks that might arise from rearranged alcohol 2b or aromatic hydroxylation products were detected. A plot showing the rate of product formation is given in Figure S2.

a3td | Analysis of the extracts from reactions with trans-1,2-di- methylcyclopropane (3) revealed only one product, the concen- tration of which increased linearly with time over a 10-min period (Figure S1). It was identified as the unrearranged alcohol, trans-(2-methylcyclopropyl)methanol (3a), through comparison of its GC retention time with that of an authentic standard. No 4-penten-2-ol (3b) or 2-methylbut-3-en-1-ol (3c) was detected.
ex5k | The substrate bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4) afforded three products upon reaction with MMO (Figure S3), each of which had its parent ion at m/z 84 as determined by GC/MS analysis. No authentic standards were available for the expected products, but one product could be positively identified as endo-2-hydroxy- bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane (4a) by comparison of its mass spectrum with one published previously.2! The second major peak in the gas chromatogram was assigned as exo-2-hydroxybicyclo- [2.1.0]pentane (4b). Unfortunately no mass spectral data for this compound were available for comparison. The peak had ap- proximately the same intensity (~85%) in the total-ion chro- matogram of the reaction extracts as that of 4a. Its mass spectrum differed from those of 4a and 3-cyclopenten-1-ol (4c), for which mass spectral data are also available.39 Hydroxylation of 4 by cytochrome P-450 yielded only 4a and 4c.21,22 The failure of this enzyme to afford 4b was attributed to constraints at the active site. It may be that the active site of MMO is less discriminating, which could account for the formation of both 4a and 4b.
9d4o | The third product from reactions with 4 was present in only trace amounts and was assigned as 3-cyclopenten-1-ol (4c). It has been reported previously that 4a undergoes thermal rear- rangement to 4c.21,22 In particular, when 4a isolated from the hydroxylation of 4 by MMO was injected into the GC/MS, the ratio of 4c to 4a was found to be ~1:30. Compound 4b is expected to behave similarly. The intensity of the peak corresponding to 4c was also found to increase relative to those for 4a and 4b when the reactions were run at 45 ℃ for longer times (Figure S3). Increasing the injector and oven temperatures of the gas chro- matograph produced a similar effect. The ratio of 4c to 4a was 1:40, or including both 4a and 4b, 1:80, and increased with longer

5esx | incubation times at 45 ℃ to about 1:15. It is therefore likely that a significant amount, if not all, of 4c obtained in these experiments is due to thermal rearrangement of 4a and 4b. The amount of 4c present in the enzymatic reactions is small enough that its presence could be solely the result of thermal rear- rangement of 4a and 4b.21
m5ka | Experiments were also carried out with 1 and the hydroxylase from M. trichosporium OB3b. In contrast to reactions with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath), three products were observed. They were identified as unrearranged alcohol la, 2-(p-hydroxy- phenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c), and rearranged product 1b. The ratio of unrearranged to rearranged alcohol was found to be 32:1 in reactions performed with coupling protein and reductase from M. capsulatus (Bath) and 22:1 for reactions using hydrogen peroxide.

76b0 | Analysis of Products Formed. In this work, four hydrocarbon substrates were employed as mechanistic probes in oxidations catalyzed by the MMO of M. capsulatus (Bath). In each case, if a hydrogen atom were abstracted from the probe, the resulting radical could either rebound to form the unrearranged product or ring open to afford the rearranged product (Scheme I). In no case was rearrangement observed. For trans-1,2-dimethylcyclo- propane (3) only a single product formed, corresponding to the unrearranged alcohol (3a, eq 2). No allylic alcohol was detected

xnth | (3b, eq 3), implying that no more than 1% of this product formed during the hydroxylation reaction. From the known rate constant for rearrangement of the corresponding cyclopropylcarbinyl radical (Table I),23 and assuming that this rate constant is the same for substrate free in solution and bound to the enzyme (vide infra), we estimate that the rebound rate constant of a radical inter- mediate would have to be at least 4 × 1010 s-1 at 45 ℃. A similar analysis23,40-42 of the results for reactions with compounds 4, 1, and 2 raises the rebound rate constant limits to 3 × 1011, 4 x 1013, and 1 X 1013 s-1, respectively. The latter two values exceed the rate constant of decomposition of a transition state and are in- compatible with a discrete radical intermediate.
vafm | The rate constants for ring opening of radicals derived from 1 and 2 (eq 4a,b) have been measured indirectly by competition against PhSeH trapping. 41,42 At room temperature, the ring

bf9k | openings have rate constants of 3 × 1011 s-1 and 5 × 1011 s-1, respectively, which places these reactions among the fastest re- ported radical rearrangements involving a bond-breaking step. With such a velocity, detectable amounts of ring-opened products are expected to be produced from these radicals even when the fastest possible trapping reactions compete. Therefore, the absence of ring-opened alcohols 1b and 2b suggests that probes 1 and 2 were converted directly to alcohols la and 2a without formation of radicals. On the other hand, a small amount of rearranged product 1b was observed in the studies of MMO from M. tri-

ibgs | chosporium OB3b. From the ratio of unrearranged to rearranged alcohol the rate constant for rebound was calculated to be 6-10 X 1012 s-1. The observed differences in the results for MMO from the two different sources will be discussed later.
colo | In the case of the chiral substrate probe 1, oxidation occurred not only at the methyl group but also at the phenyl ring to form 2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)methylcyclopropane (1c) (Table I).38 The fact that la and 1c are produced in equal quantities over the course of the reaction suggested that the two products might arise from different enantiomers of the probe. Preliminary studies with partially resolved 1 tend to confirm this possibility (unpublished results), but more data are required for the hydroxylation of both pure enantiomers before a definitive statement can be made.
d6r4 | Deuterium Isotope Effects. Studies of the reaction of deuterated derivatives of 1 with MMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) failed to reveal any intermolecular isotope effect. Both individual and competitive reactions with the undeuterated and trideuterated derivatives yielded values of (KH/KD)obsd of approximately 1.0 and in good agreement with one another, considering the error limits. It is important to note that the ratio of undeuterated and tri- deuterated phenols observed in the competition experiment was 1.1. When combined with the ratio of 0.89 for the undeuterated and dideuterated alcohols la, this result shows that the overall rates of oxidation of the undeuterated and trideuterated substrates were equal. Thus, there was essentially no kinetic discrimination for substrates by the enzyme, and this behavior suggests that C-H bond breaking is not rate-limiting in the overall hydroxylation reaction. Such a result is consistent with some,15,43 but not all,44 previous studies of MMO hydroxylation reactions using deuterated substrates.
9mrz | Given that the overall oxidation rates of 1-do and 1-d3 were the same, the product distributions should be considered in more detail. If oxidation of each of the enantiomers of substrate 1 could have occurred at either the methyl group or the aromatic ring, and if rotation can occur in the active site, then a kinetic isotope effect should have been observed in the oxidations of the undeuterated and trideuterated probes, with substantially more phenol product being formed in the latter case. This result is clearly predicted from the intramolecular kinetic isotope effects that were found (vide infra). That such was not the case reinforces our speculation that products la and 1c arise mainly from different enantiomers of the probe.
pk06 | In contrast to the lack of an intermolecular isotope effect, a significant intramolecular isotope effect of approximately 5.1 (statistically corrected) was observed in oxidations of both the mono- and dideuterated probes 1. In each case, the observed isotope effects are equal to the primary kinetic isotope effects (kH/kp) divided by a secondary kinetic isotope effect that results from the fact that in both cases an additional deuterium atom remains bound after oxidation of a C-H bond. The data do not permit an extraction of the secondary kinetic isotope effect, but it is clear that the (KH/KD)obsd ratio signals a substantial C-H bond stretching component in the transition state of the rate-limiting step in the oxidation reaction. The value of (KH/kp)obsd = 5.1 may be compared with the intramolecular isotope effect of 7.8 observed in the oxidation of probe 1 with P. oleovorans mono- oxygenase.25 Recently, a value of kH/kp = 4.2 ± 0.2 was reported for MMO from M. trichosporium OB3b with the substrates (S)- and (R)-[1-2H,1-3H]ethane, in good agreement with the present results.45 Cytochrome P-450 dependent enzymes oxidize a number of substrates with intramolecular isotope effects of 7-14.22 In- tramolecular isotope effects for hydrogen atom abstractions by the reactive tert-butoxy radical studied at temperatures in the vicinity of 25 ℃ range from 1.2 to 5.4, and isotope effects for hydrogen abstractions by less reactive peroxy radicals are greater.46

wcd0 | Mechanistic Considerations: Formation of the Dioxygen-Ac- tivated Diiron Center. Scheme II outlines a reasonable working hypothesis for the catalytic mechanism of MMO. Substrate first binds to the complete system, which contains all three protein components. Addition of NADH then effects a two-electron reduction of the hydroxylase from the oxidized Fel"Fell to the fully reduced Fe"Fell form, bypassing the inactive47 Fe"FellI state.7.44 The fully reduced hydroxylase next reacts with dioxygen in a two-electron step to form a diiron(III) peroxide complex which, either itself or upon transformation via two more electron transfer steps at the diiron center, is sufficiently activated to attack the hydrocarbon substrate. The nature of this transformed species, if it exists, is currently unknown, but it could involve a high-valent iron oxo moiety (Scheme III), by analogy with that proposed for cytochrome P-450.17 The second iron atom in the MMO hy- droxylase active site would stabilize such a unit through redox charge delocalization, as shown in Scheme III, in much the same fashion that cytochrome P-450 is thought to facilitate the for- mation of a high-valent iron oxo species through oxidation of the porphyrin ring to a T-cation radical. Alternatively, the internal two-electron transfer step could produce an active site radical (R'), such as the hydroxyl radical or a ligand-based radical involving an amino acid residue, and an iron(IV) center that would again be stabilized by tautomerization and electron transfer involving the other iron atom (Scheme III). Although there is presently no direct evidence for such a radical species in the MMO hy- droxylase active site, the combination of a redox-active metal with a protein-derived radical to effect oxygen-activated redox transformations is known in the related iron enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, 48 in the heme peroxidase prostaglandin H synthase,49

pn9j | and in the copper enzyme galactose oxidase.50 A third possibility is that the diiron(III) peroxide unit itself might be sufficiently activated to carry out the hydroxylation reaction. As depicted in Scheme III, the peroxide ligand might perhaps be coordinated to the diiron(III) unit in an n2,n2 fashion, analogous to the binding mode thought to be important in dicopper enzymes that transport or activate dioxygen, for example, hemocyanin and tyrosinase.51,52 Other modes of peroxide binding to one or both iron atoms are possible, as indicated in Chart II. Several important model studies have provided spectroscopic evidence for the existence of diiron(III) peroxides;53,54 related species,55-57 including a high-valent iron oxo intermediate,58 have been implicated in hydroxylation and ep- oxidation reactions. None has yet been structurally characterized, however.
1pmc | Once the activated iron center, whatever it may be, is dis- charged, product is released with concomitant formation of the diiron(III) form of the hydroxylase that enters another cycle in the catalysis (Scheme II). A peroxide shunt, analogous to that found in the P-450 enzyme, has been reported for the M. tri- chosporium OB3b MMO16 and confirmed by us in the present work. As indicated in Scheme II, the use of hydrogen peroxide permits hydroxylation reactions to occur in the absence of the coupling and reductase proteins. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxylase isolated from the M. capsulatus (Bath) organism, however, displays only 5-10% of the activity measured with the complete, three-protein system.59
