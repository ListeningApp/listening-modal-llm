You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

87cq | To the best of our knowledge, most of the metallodrug evaluation studies that incor- porate 3D models use spheroid-based models, as summarized in Table 1, which depicts the advantages, disadvantages, and complexity of each cancer 3D model, as well as published literature on the application of 3D models for metallodrug preclinical testing. This could be related to the fact that protocols for the spheroid production of several cancer cell lines have already been well established. In comparison with other 3D models, spheroids are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain, while still providing a 3D structure that can replicate the aspects of in vivo tumors. More recently, some studies have already started incorporating organoid and tumoroid models in their research. The complexity of these models not only allows for better mimicking the in vivo tumor, increasing the relevancy of the study, but also introduces aspects of precision medicine, which are essential for future clinical applications. Additionally, microengineering approaches, especially 3D bioprinting, have gained interest lately, due to their ability to precisely control key aspects of experimental conditions. In the following sections, a brief description of the types of assays performed in these models will be presented, as well as the most illustrative examples of preclinical biological evaluation of metallodrugs in 3D models.
0qs3 | 5.1. Assays Performed on 3D Models
z8f7 | The application of 3D models to test the anti-tumoral activity of metallodrugs has mainly focused on the assessment of cytotoxicity, penetration, and evaluation of metabolic effects.
7w7j | 5.1.1. Cytotoxicity Assays
51vd | Cytotoxicity can be defined as the toxicity induced by chemotherapeutic drugs in live cells [157]. The viability of 3D models can be assessed after incubation with the metallo- drugs through several methods, such as the alamar blue assay, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2- thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, CellTiter-Glo® 3D Viability Assay, or acid phosphatase (APH) assay. These methods use different metabolic reactions to eval- uate the number of viable cells in the 3D models after exposure to the metallodrug [70-73]. The alamar blue and MTT assays are based on the reduction of resazurin or tetrazolium salts, measuring the mitochondrial activity [158], while the CellTiter-Glo® 3D Viability Assay indicates cell viability through ATP measurement [159] and the APH assay quantifies the cytosolic acid phosphatase activity [160].
baj1 | 5.1.2. Penetration Assays
n1wo | One of the factors responsible for drug resistance may be the inability of anti-cancer drugs to penetrate solid tumors [161]. The tumor penetration of the compound is thus an essential aspect that needs to be studied to obtain optimal drug efficiency [74]. As discussed previously, fluorescence imaging is a complex technique to image spheroids and tumoroids, which has some disadvantages. Additionally, in most circumstances, metal complexes have to be tagged with fluorophores to be detected through this technique, which may affect the distribution of the compound [162,163]. The capacity of the metallodrugs to penetrate tumor models can also be assessed using a combination of analytic and imaging tools, such as laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF), or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI-MSI) [69,74,75].
5bq3 | 5.1.3. Metabolomics Assays
ezla | Omics approaches have been proven to be strong methods for studying drug suscep- tibility, drug resistance, and mechanisms of action [164]. Metabolic patterns are widely considered accurate predictors of phenotypes and such patterns could be used to predict or better understand the anti-tumoral activity of metallodrugs [165,166]. One approach to studying the metabolites of spheroids after exposure to metallodrugs is using LC-MS- based metabolomics, in which liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are com- bined [76,167]. Although not described so far for the study of metallodrugs, other omics studies with different approaches for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, sea- horse assay, and metabolic imaging have already been used in cancer 3D models [168-173].
rsbu | 5.2. Selected Examples of the Evaluation of Metallodrugs in 3D Models
magd | In order to highlight the relevance of the use of 3D models in cancer research, the most relevant applications of these models for metallodrug evaluation will be presented, focusing on discrete metal complexes rather than nanomaterials. From a limited number of reports in the literature, the examples presented next were selected based on the diversity of metals (and metalloids) explored, on the different 3D models and types of assays performed, and on the tumor types (Table 1).
tb74 | 5.2.1. A ruthenium-Based 5-Fluorouracil Complex with Enhanced Cytotoxicity in Colon Carcinoma
8l69 | Silva et al. synthesized a novel Ru-based compound, [Ru(5-FU)(PPh3)2(bipy)]PF6, and tested its effect on cell-based models [71]. Complexes containing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are commonly used to treat colon and rectal carcinoma, so the cytotoxicity of this compound was studied in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells [71,174].
1jyv | The cytotoxicity of the complex was first tested in several tumoral and healthy cell lines using the alamar blue assay. The cytotoxicity was presented in terms of IC50, which corresponds to the amount of a drug required to inhibit a biological process or response by 50% [175]. The HCT116 cells were determined as the most sensitive to the compound
olce | [Ru(5-FU)(PPh3)2(bipy)]PF6, with an IC50 of 1.5 uM. The cytotoxicity was also evaluated in HCT116 spheroids grown at a density of 5000 cells/well in U-bottom low adhesion plates, presenting an IC50 of 1.7 uM, as depicted in Figure 2. As 2D models are reported to be less resistant to drugs than 3D models, it is expected that the IC50 is lower. However, comparing the IC50 obtained for the 2D and 3D models it is possible to see that the difference between the two types of models is very small. So, this complex also presents high cytotoxicity at lower concentrations in 3D models, which suggests that it has great potential for treating solid tumors [71]. This should be further studied in more complex models, such as tumoroids, in order to verify the therapeutic potential of the compound. Overall, [Ru(5-FU)(PPh3)2(bipy)]PF6 presented higher cytotoxicity in tumoral cells than 5-FU in both 2D and 3D cell models [71].
erx1 | 5.2.2. Boron Clusters as a Novel Therapy against Glioblastoma
b3bt | Metallacarboranes ([M(C2B9H11)2] ) are 3D aromatic complexes composed of a cen- tral metal ion, usually Co or Fe, that is the common vertex of two joined icosahedrons, with interesting advantages in terms of their high stability, water solubility, and redox potential [176-178]. Similar to carboranes, these compounds are tunable, but the metal core adds additional features regarding the redox potential and the charge of the molecule [70].
