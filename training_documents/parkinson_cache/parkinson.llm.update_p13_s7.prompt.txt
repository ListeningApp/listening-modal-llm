You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

1i8b | Another VPS family member associated with PD is VPS13C. Five allelic variations in VPS13C gene can lead to autosomal recessive, early-onset PD, primarily due to premature termination of VPS13C (Lesage et al. 2016; Schormair et al. 2018). Patients were noted with cardinal PD symptoms and extrapyramidal signs. Post-mortem studies revealed a-synuclein/ ubiquitin positive-Lewy bodies in the brain stem, limbic system, hippocampus, and cortical associative areas (Lesage et al. 2016). A few studies reveal that VPS13 functions in the TGN-endosomal cycle (De et al. 2017), whereas recent discoveries have also located it on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Lesage et al. 2016). In fact, siRNA-mediated silencing of VPS13C resulted in lower mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial fragmentation, increased respiratory rates, exacerbated Parkin-dependent mitophagy, and upregulation of Parkin in response to mitochondrial damage (Lesage et al. 2016). A new study also revealed VPS13C's role in forming membrane contact sites and facilitating lipid transfer between the ER and mitochondria (Kumar et al. 2018). This is noteworthy, considering lipid transfer's increasing recognition in disease pathogenesis.
5sfj | Since lysosomes are the destination for most E-L system vesicles carrying a variety of cargos for degradation and recycling (Figure 1A), dysfunction in any of its components results in lysosomal storage disorders, severely perturbing cellular homeostasis. A growing body of evidence suggests Lysosomal Storage Disorders increase risk for PD pathogenesis (Robak et al. 2017). Among them, Gaucher disease (GD) confers the greatest risk, where 5- 15% of GD patients or carriers develop PD later in life, to an extent where causal GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for PD (Table 1) (Aharon-Peretz et al. 2004; Bultron et al. 2010; Simon-Sanchez et al. 2009). GBA encodes glucocerebrosidase 1 (Gcase1), which facilitates breakdown of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) into glucose and ceramide. In its absence, GlcCer accumulates and undergoes partial enzymatic deacylation to glucosylsphingosine and other more complex glycosphingolipids, which mediate disease pathogenesis. GBA is a relatively well studied E-L system gene with regards to PD, both in terms of post-mortem brains, clinical investigations, and basic research. Reduced Gcase1 activity in substantia nigra, putamen, and other brain areas of PD patients with GBA mutations have been noted along with GlcCer and glycosphingolipids accumulation (Alcalay et al. 2015; Gegg et al. 2012). Interestingly, similar observations were made even in sporadic PD patients (Alcalay et al. 2015; Rocha et al. 2015), suggesting an even broader role for GBA than just mutations and potentially involve epigenetic and environmental modifiers of GBA. Gcase1 levels decrease with aging, the major risk factor for PD (Hallett et al. 2018; Rocha et al. 2015), indicating GBA's possible role in lowering the nigral neurons' threshold to develop PD. Cognitive areas such as hippocampus, frontal cortex, and amygdala also showed relative decrease in GCase1 activity, along with a significant elevation of hippocampal glucosylsphingosine in sporadic cases (Gegg et al. 2012). This correlates with a higher Lewy body burden identified in the hippocampus and medial temporal regions, as well as a diffused cortical Lewy body pathology in GBA-linked PD (Hallett et al. 2018; Watson & Leverenz 2010). These pathological observations strengthen clinical findings that cognitive deterioration is severe in PD patients with GBA mutations compared to that of sporadic cases (Liu et al. 2016; Mata et al. 2016). These features indicate mouse models of
vk4h | PD with GBA mutations are important in studying lipid dyshomeostasis and understand mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in PD.
nsm3 | A recent study by Taguchi et al., provides evidence for an association between loss of Gcase1 activity, glycosphingolipids accumulation, and a-synuclein aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo models of Gba mutation (Taguchi et al. 2017). Glucosylsphingosine was shown to promote pathological a-synuclein aggregates, capable for further self-templating, was shown to accumulate in the brains of young homozygous Gba mutant and KO mice, implicating this glycosphingolipid in PD pathogenesis. Even in heterozygous Gba mutations, the Gcase1 activity decreased with age to an extent where mice reached threshold for haploinsufficiency, mimicking the human condition. Furthermore, the Gba mutant mice, when crossed with well characterised a-synuclein transgenic PD mice, revealed accelerated PD progression including a-synuclein aggregation and motor deficits (Taguchi et al. 2017). a-Synuclein aggregation has also been seenin human iPSCs derived neurons from GD and PD patients that are exposed to Gcase1 inhibitors, and in those carrying GBA mutations (Zunke et al. 2018). Mutations in GBA also cause misprocessing of Gcase1 in the ER, leading to ER retention of Gcase1. This produces ER stress and auto-lysosomal perturbations causing an abnormal lipid profile and increased a-synuclein accumulation and secretion (Fernandes et al. 2016; Ron & Horowitz 2005). This study along with a few other observations suggest dopaminergic dysfunction due to gain-of-function mutations in Gba (Cullen et al. 2011; Fernandes et al. 2016; Sidransky & Lopez 2012). However, therapeutic strategies based on loss-of-function observations have been successful, arguing against a gain of function model. Activation of residual Gcase1 by small molecules and chaperones and ameliorating glycosphingolipid accumulation by inhibiting GlcCer synthase lowered a- synuclein pathology and reinstated lysosomal health (Richter et al. 2014; Charvin et al. 2018; Sardi et al. 2017). These strategies are already being tested in clinics (Richter et al. 2014).
