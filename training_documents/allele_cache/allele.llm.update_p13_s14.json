The remaining SNVs were annotated with ChIPseeker with a hierarchical assignment of the following categories: promoter (less than or equal to one kilobase), promoter\n320g | (one to two kilobases), promoter (two to three kilobases), five prime UTR, three prime UTR, Exon, Intron, Downstream, Inter-genic. For clarity, promoter (less than or equal to one kilobase) and five prime UTR categories were both tagged as \"promoter\"; promoter (one to two kilobases) and promoter (two to three kilobases) were both tagged as \"upstream.\"\ntp8g | Sequence motif analysis of ASBs. For TF ASBs, we annotated the corresponding SNVs with sequence motif hits of the respective TFs. To this end, we used models from HOCOMOCO version eleven core collection and SPRY-SARUS for motif finding. The top-scoring motif hit was taken considering both Ref and Alt alleles, and, at this fixed position, the \"motif FC\" was calculated as the log two ratio of motif P values at the reference and alternative variants so that the positive FC corresponded to the preference of the alternative allele.\ngxfd | To analyze the ASB motif concordance, we considered the ASB SNVs (min FDR Ref less than or equal to zero point zero five that overlapped the predicted TF-binding site: (min motif P value Ref motif P value Alt less than or equal to zero point zero zero zero five, and had FC absolute value greater than or equal to two. We defined the motif concordance or discordance as a match or mismatch of the signs of FC and\ns2v1 | Delta F D R equals log base ten F D R Alt minus log base ten F D R Ref. Annotation of ASBs with phenotype associations. To assess enrichment of ASBs within phenotype-associated SNPs, we used the data from four different SNP-phenotype associations databases, namely: one) NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog, release August twenty-seventh two thousand nineteen with EFO mappings used to group phenotypes by their parent terms for Supplementary Figure nine; two) ClinVar catalog, release September fifth two thousand nineteen (entries with \"likely pathogenic,\" \"pathogenic,\" or \"risk factor\" clinical significance); three) PheWAS catalog; four) BROAD fine-mapping catalog of causal autoimmune disease variants. All entries were systematized in the form of triples, dbSNP ID, phenotype, database. Next, the entries were annotated with the TF- or cell type-ASB data.\njkp9 | To evaluate TF-phenotype associations in detail, we used NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog and the following pipeline:\nz8tt | one) We filtered out TFs with less than two candidate ASBs, and phenotypes associated with less than two SNPs, resulting in seven hundred sixty-five TFs and two thousand six hundred eighty-eight phenotypes suitable for the analysis. For each TF, we considered all SNPs with candidate ASBs passing the coverage thresholds.\n9g22 | two) For each pair of a TF and a phenotype, we calculated the odds ratio and the P value of the one-tailed Fisher's exact test on SNPs with candidate ASBs considering two binary features: whether the SNP is associated with the phenotype, and whether the SNP is included in ASB candidates of the particular TF. The superset of SNPs was collected independently for each TF by gathering SNPs with candidate ASBs for all TFs but only from LD blocks containing either TF-specific SNPs or phenotype-associated SNPs. The P values were then FDR corrected for multiple tested TFs separately for each phenotype.\n41fx | Analysis of eQTLs and eQTL target genes. To analyze an overlap between ASBs and eQTLs, we used significant variant, gene pairs from GTEx (release Veight).\n7um8 | To evaluate ASB-driven eQTL target genes' associations with medical phenotypes, a one-tailed Fisher's exact test was performed on the enrichment of protein-coding genes of medical relevance (six thousand twenty-six genes found linked with entries with \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" or \"risk factor\" clinical significance in Clin Var catalog) among eQTL target genes of ASB SNPs (sixteen thousand eight hundred sixty-five protein-coding genes according to GTEx), considering all human protein-coding genes from GENCODE (version thirty-five, nineteen thousand nine hundred twenty-nine gene symbols) as the background set.\nuow2 | ASB prediction with machine learning. In our work, we used a standard software implementation of the random forest model from the scikit-learn package. The number of estimators was set to five hundred and the other parameters were defaults. Three feature types were used: allele-specific chromatin DNase accessibility, synthetic data from neurons from the last layer of the DeepSEA, and HOCOMOCO motif predictions obtained with SPRY-SARUS. As a global set of SNVs, we used two hundred thirty-one thousand three hundred fifty-five dbSNP IDs overlapping between ADASTRA and Maurano\niat7 | et al. data, which provided allele-specific DNase accessibility. For the general model, we used SNVs with ASBs for any of TFs or in any of cell types as members of the positive class, and the remaining set of candidate SNVs as members of the negative class. For TF- and cell type-specific assessment, we defined ASB and non-ASB SNVs for a particular TF or in a particular cell type as the positive and negative class, respectively.\nywwr | Data availability\n0i6j | Code availability\n87cq | Received: fifteen October two thousand twenty; Accepted: twelve April two thousand twenty-one; Published online: twelve May two thousand twenty-one\n0qs3 | Author contributions\nz8f7 | Competing interests\n7w7j | The authors declare no competing interests.\n51vd | Additional information",
