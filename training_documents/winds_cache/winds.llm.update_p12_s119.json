Abundance and biomass of C. mastigophora stranded on Cable Beach\ndqn8 | The average wet weight of one hundred sixty-eight C. mastigophora washed ashore on Cable Beach on fifth October twenty twelve (as predicted from mean bell diameter) was two hundred sixty-eight point four grams. The mean density (individuals per meter squared plus or minus one standard error) of C. mastigophora washed ashore on Cable Beach on eighth October twenty twelve was two point six five plus or minus zero point six four (range zero point six to five point four) for the six high-water transects and one point seven four plus or minus zero point five eight (range zero point five to three point nine) for the six low-water transects. The average was two point two zero plus or minus zero point four three individuals per meter squared for all twelve transects along the whole beach. This was used as an estimate of density\ncop0 | for the whole beach and corresponded to a wet weight of five hundred ninety point six plus or minus one hundred fifteen point four grams per meter squared. Using a conservative estimate of beach width of one hundred meters (measured average was one hundred fifteen point five meters, see Materials and Methods section) along the\nlhkq | Hydrobiologia\n82ju | two point five kilometers of beach where the density data were collected, means that the area of beach surveyed was two hundred fifty thousand meters squared. Accordingly it can be calculated that along this stretch of beach, one hundred forty-seven point six plus or minus twenty-eight point nine tonnes of jellyfish was deposited\ny2qo | Hydrobiologia\n1piq | by the tide. This is equivalent to fifty-nine point zero plus or minus eleven point five tonnes per linear kilometer of beach. The survey by vehicle of the extent of the swarm south and north of Cable Beach revealed that the jellyfish were washed up in similar numbers between Gantheaume Point and Coconut Wells, a distance of fifteen kilometers (Figure one three). If the density and size distribution of C. mastigophora along this section of coastline were similar to that measured on Cable Beach as suggested by the photographic record obtained in our survey, then this would equate to a biomass of eight hundred eighty-six plus or minus one hundred seventy-three tonnes (three point thirty million plus or minus zero point sixty-four million jellyfish) being deposited along the coast on eighth October twenty twelve. Strandings of similar scale were observed on a total of sixteen days between twelfth September and seventeenth October twenty twelve meaning a total of fifty-two point eight million plus or minus ten point three million (fourteen thousand one hundred seventy-two plus or minus two thousand seven hundred seventy tonnes) jellyfish may have washed ashore during this time. The estimate is\n7fqw | conservative given on each of these sixteen days that there were two tidal cycles each depositing jellyfish on the beach and there were smaller (but significant) numbers washed up on each of the other fifty-seven days between twelfth August and twenty third October.\nrhaz | Diet and commensal organisms\nwak1 | The prey items recovered from the tentacles of fourteen C. mastigophora are shown in Figure eight. On average, two hundred twenty organisms were recovered from tentacles plus or minus sixty-eight S E. The taxonomic composition included small copepods, copepod fragments and other crustaceans, bivalves, invertebrate eggs, phytoplankton and microzooplankton (Figure eight). All medusae had invertebrate eggs, and the majority had bivalves, pteropods, amphipods and copepods (Figure eight). Proportionately bivalves,\nwtfz | pteropods and invertebrate eggs dominated the prey captured (Figure eight). There was no difference in organisms found in tentacles of medusae collected from Dampier Creek or Gantheaume Point. Two jellyfish from Gantheaume Point harboured small (two centimeter) carangid fishes as associate/commensal organisms.\nqy1i | Discussion\n1k9e | Distribution and occurrence of swarms\n5bjs | This study found that significant jellyfish stranding events were associated with smaller than average tide range, with a time lag of two days. Using the same time lag, more than ninety percent of all strandings occurred when winds (as measured by satellite out over the oceans to the west of the beach) were blowing onshore, but this result was not statistically significant. Modelled currents flowing onshore were associated with sixty-three to sixty-eight percent of strandings depending on the time lag used. Combining these three factors in a logistic regression model failed to provide a better prediction of stranding events than tide range on its own. The influence of tide alone on meso-scale physical processes affecting jellyfish distribution would explain why days with significant beach strandings were interspersed with days of absent or minimal stranding. However, we expect that some combination of influence of wind or currents acting to bring the jellyfish close to the shore and the small tides preventing significant advection away from the beach is taking place. Tides, winds and currents are known to influence distribution of jellyfish and cause them to concentrate or \"swarm\" near to the shore. The time lags account for the period between when physical processes are enacted and when their consequences (jellyfish on beach) are observed. The use of time lags in wind data has previously been shown to be important in predicting jellyfish distribution in Physalia (which have \"sails\"). Our study shows that the use of time lags in tide range may be a useful predictor of rhizostome jellyfish distribution, at least, in areas where large tide ranges exist, such as in the north-west of Australia. Tidal influence has been shown to be the dominant onshore-offshore current transport mechanism in this region.\nuodj | Hydrobiologia\n```",
