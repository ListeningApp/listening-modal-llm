Eight studies including eight hundred sixty-nine subjects had complete site-level data and so were used in the analyses assessing the relationships between 'stable periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy' and subsequent tooth loss. Ten studies followed conventional APT. Five studies reported on periodontitis-related tooth loss, and so this data were used when available. Studies without two arms were subsequently not included in the corresponding meta-analyses when analyzing the WWC twenty seventeen and PPD greater than or equal to six millimeters.\ngpu9 | Three point one point three Prevalence of stable and successfully treated periodontitis subjects at the start of SPC\nu5ws | Table two and Supplemental Material S four display the prevalence data of each of the fifteen studies at the subject and tooth level for achieving the endpoints.\nonkh | Subject-level data\n8t55 | Of twelve thousand five hundred sixty-three subjects who had complete site-level data, one point three five percent (n equals one hundred sixty-nine) fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis' and eleven percent met the 'endpoints of therapy'. 'Controlled periodontitis' was achieved in thirty-four point six two percent (n equals four thousand four hundred sixty) of the twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four subjects, while PPD is less than five millimeters and PPD is less than six millimeters were achieved in six point seven percent (n equals eight hundred sixty-three) and thirty point four five percent (n equals three thousand nine hundred twenty-three) of subjects, respectively. Achievement of endpoints varied greatly across studies. The prevalence of reaching each of the five subject-level endpoints increased when studies following conventional APT were analyzed (nine point four three percent fulfilled the criteria of 'stable periodontitis', twenty-seven point six percent met the 'endpoints of therapy', fifty-two point four two percent achieved 'controlled periodontitis', while twenty-one point zero eight percent and forty-nine point seven six percent achieved PPD is less than five millimeters and PPD is less than six millimeters, respectively).\n7imw | Tooth-level data\nlf1t | Of three hundred twenty-three thousand one hundred eleven teeth, three hundred fourteen thousand nine hundred sixty-three teeth had complete site-level data. A total of fifty-four point six nine percent and seventy-three point five five percent of teeth met the composite measures described in 'stable periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy', respectively, and sixty-eight point five two percent and eighty-seven point three two percent of all included teeth had P P D is less than five millimeters and PPD is less than six millimeters, respectively. Maxillary molars achieved tooth-level endpoints least frequently (twenty-four point one eight percent and forty-seven point two zero percent, respectively, for 'stable\ntze7 | periodontitis' and 'endpoints of therapy'), closely followed by mandibular molars. As per WWC twenty seventeen, there were eleven point three six and eleven point five one 'diseased' teeth per patient after APT among all twelve thousand five hundred sixty-three subjects and twelve thousand three hundred ninety-four 'unstable' subjects, respectively. This reduced to four point seven nine and five point two nine 'diseased' teeth in all seven hundred thirty-two subjects and six hundred sixty-three 'unstable' subjects, respectively, from studies following conventional APT.\nryvv | Three point one point four Tooth loss at five years according to endpoints at the start of SPC\nzdrh | Figures two and three display subject- and tooth-level meta-analyses of not achieving the various endpoints and tooth loss.
