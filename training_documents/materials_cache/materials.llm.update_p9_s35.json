Second, the lattice is expanded until the sum of the volume of the atomic spheres becomes seventy percent of the volume of the unit cell, where the anionic and cationic radii are set to be zero point six and one point four, respectively.

Cationic Radii\nmov9 | The eleven cations, which are listed in Table two of the main article, are selected by considering closed packed polyhedra consisting of the centered cation and surrounding oxygen ions. Cationic radius C n (n belongs to natural numbers) corresponds to the minimum radius so that the cation can connect n oxygen ions, while C O corresponds to the ionic radius of oxygen ion. Table S one lists the value of C n and C O.\nks7m | All cations have the same cationic repulsion radius r C equals one point four which is the same as the ionic radius of oxygen ion to avoid the condensation of cations.\nw1w1 | II. NUMERICAL ASPECTS\nh8gv | Table S two lists the common parameters for the global and local geometrical optimizations. The geometrical constraints are given by the minimum and maximum distances between atoms as\nkwkp | x i j T greater than or equal to d y g n, L i j T less than or equal to d o max, (S five) but when we confirm the feasibility of the structure after local geometrical optimization, we permit five percent error as\nyj0m | T i j T greater than or equal to zero point nine five d i j one, (minimum) X i j T less than or equal to one point zero five d i j T (maximum)\newfp | E).

Table S five shows the number of H t four T two five and H t four T four O sixteen samples optimized to the spinel structure; about ten percent of H t four T two O eight are optimized to spinel structure, while zero point zero one percent of H t four T four O sixteen are optimized to spinel structure.\no56m |  ture. Nine hundred thirty-eight thousand five hundred forty-two samples of eight H t four T four O sixteen cannot reach optimal solutions if we use the optimization parameters shown in Tables S two, S three, and S four.\nslz6 | Generally, not all the cations have the maximum number of chemical bonds. The global geometrical optimization is aimed at transforming the structure largely enough to create a different network of chemical bonds so that every cation satisfies its bonding needs.
