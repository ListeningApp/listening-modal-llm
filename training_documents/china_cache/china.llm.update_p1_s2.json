Using historical methods and archival evidence, it overcomes the limitations in existing research, which is often theoretically driven and reliant on published sources. The article reveals that the Hong Kong masses were made structurally invisible by the Movement of Opinion Direction, a polling exercise introduced by the reformist colonial state. The public were unaware that their views were disseminated to policymakers and that they affected policy formulation: this was covert colonialism. The article investigates confidential Movement of Opinion Direction reports generated by the Home Affairs Department from nineteen seventy-five to nineteen eighty, demonstrating why and how the colonial administration constructed public opinion. By disclosing what these secret files reveal about changing public attitudes towards the colonial government, the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, the article also provides new insights into public receptions of the state's reforms and potential threats to the colonial regime in the nineteen seventies.\n4exe | From the nineteen eighties, there has been considerable polling of public opinion in Hong Kong, undertaken for example for the Hong Kong Transition Project and the Hong Kong University Public Opinion Programme. Prior to the nineteen sixties, the colonial state in Hong Kong did not consult the public directly. Ambrose King described the administrative system as a 'synarchy': 'a joint administration shared by both British rulers and non-British,\n0myz | Email: ywfm five zero zero at yorkdot acdot uk\nxh3i | predominantly Chinese leaders'. There were few channels for the public to raise their grievances. The Urban Council was the only institution with democratically elected members. Nonetheless, only two of ten were elected councilors and its franchise remained extremely limited. Although the franchise was slightly widened in nineteen sixty-five, its authority was rarely extended. This was mainly because of the colonial government's reluctance to introduce a 'significantly more democratic local government'. Senior civil servants firmly believed in the efficiency of a centralized administration and were concerned that an increasingly democratic local government would lead the Chinese government to believe that Hong Kong was 'moving down the path to independence'. As a result, a strong sense of 'alienation' was felt by Hong Kong society. The Star Ferry Riots in nineteen sixty-six first 'revealed the existence of considerable social discontent' in the colony. A communication gap between the state and society was evident. It was then when the colonial government started recognizing that 'an unreformed law and order' was 'unsustainable' and 'new forms of legitimation' were required. Nonetheless, no regular opinion polls were conducted at this point. Opinions of the public were only gauged on an ad hoc basis in response to the riots by the Commission of Inquiry, the Secretary of Chinese Affairs, and the police force. The leftist-inspired riots in nineteen sixty-seven represented a new test or a question of legitimacy' for the colonial government. To prevent future upheavals, the state reformed. The introduction of the City District Officer Scheme in nineteen sixty-eight widened channels of political participation without introducing democratization or delegating further executive power to the Urban Council. It signified a departure from the colonial government's ruling strategies. The scheme was 'a multifunctional political structure'. Ten City District Offices were set up to provide policymakers with intelligence about public opinion, to explain the state's policies, to answer public enquiries, and to manage district affairs. This reform sought to incorporate the lower strata of society into the administrative authority. City District Officers observed the people of Hong Kong in their everyday lives and surveyed them collectively via District Monthly Meetings and Study Groups, which were new devices 'geared primarily to reach local leaders'; Town Talk, a new confidential official publication, was oriented towards ordinary people.\nsyiw | The City District Officer Scheme has not been thoroughly explored. Most of the scholarship so far touches on it briefly and is theoretically driven. Steve Tsang, John Carroll, and Ian Scott, for example, have provided a short institutional history of the scheme, mainly focusing on the background in which it was introduced and its functions. King's article published in nineteen seventy-five is the most recent article with a detailed account of the scheme. King's work mainly relies on published sources and small-scale oral interviews: it is impressionistic. His article does not show how the colonial state constructed and monitored public opinion using the Movement of Opinion Direction, a significant innovation, and state-funded public opinion polling before the nineteen eighties.\nkg3t | The nineteen seventies was an important period for Hong Kong. It was an age of rising affluence, political consciousness, and policy initiatives. A detailed and longitudinal view of state-society relations in the nineteen seventies is vital because these years were precursors to political and social changes in the nineteen eighties and beyond. Using historical methods, this study examines Movement of Opinion Direction, a bureaucratic instrument, which was produced by the Home Affairs Department to monitor shifts in public sentiments, complementing the City District Officer Scheme and other longer-established indirect mechanisms to gauge public\nlvae | attitudes. The department started producing confidential Movement of Opinion Direction reports in nineteen seventy-five and the last issue of Movement of Opinion Direction accessible at the Hong Kong Public Record Office was printed in nineteen eighty: this is the range covered by this article. This article demonstrates how the state, by observing and surveying ordinary people, constructed public opinion. It argues that by using Movement of Opinion Direction, the bureaucracy was making the Hong Kong masses structurally invisible. Although high-ranked officers were fully aware of Movement of Opinion Direction, which was embedded in the City District Officer programme, its presence was concealed from the public. People therefore unconsciously took part in policy formulation: this was covert colonialism. Deploying relatively sophisticated sampling techniques, Movement of Opinion Direction informed colonial bureaucrats about popular responses to its reforms.\no9sc | The invisible structure",
