They then partially weaken the force of such concessions through strategically designed reassertions.\nks7m | Excerpt three\nw1w1 | Participants: M: Moderator, D: Don, H: Hal, A: Andy\nh8gv | One M: so looks (.) important (.) not that important really, or=\nkwkp | Two D: =no (.) not=\nyj0m | Three M: =although good looking is not bad\newfp | Four D: yeah (.) but not unless like you don't know em' not unless (.) only 5 when you don't know em (.) then looks do everything for you\noczy | Six M: but (.) you know (.) do you think guys are more interested in girls' 7 looks than girls are interested in guys' looks\n2ttg | Eight H: guys are more so (.) but you have to go through a certain number of girls first (.) like that number in growing up (.) you know (.) to\nhis3 | Ten see through girls (one point zero) I don't know if they've ((motions to other boys)) went through that (.)

Don cuts in and seems to orient to the 'not that important' option (line two). The moderator quickly cuts back in line three and softly amends it to 'although good looking is not bad'. By doing this, he is able to offer a third option that maintains the importance of looks before Don can fully construct a position to the contrary. Don agrees with this more softened option, and goes on to draw up the initial proposition that when you do not know the person, 'looks do everything for you' (line five). Hal's first concession comes several lines later (lines eight to eleven), and it positions Hal in at least three ways. It softens the extremity of 'looks do everything' in Don's original proposition, it insulates guys' interests in girls' looks from appearing unaffected by maturation, and it makes Hal appear sexually mature, experienced, and reasonable. Despite his concession, however, Hal shifts back in line twelve to the tenor of the original proposition in saying 'but it still has to be there (.) you\n3c47 | know (.) you can't be like the ugliest girl'. This weaker statement is designed to counter the concession itself, as if to make sure Hal doesn't now appear too mature, and thus totally uninterested in girls' looks. But then, both he and Don (lines fourteen to fifteen) soften again this already weaker statement by admitting that having the prettiest girl is not always possible, nor do they necessarily want it. Again, this concession is designed to fend off potential counter-arguments, and offers a more mature position that appears rational, in the sense of 'knowing' that always having the prettiest girl is not realistic. As Couper- Kuhlen and Thompson argue, concessions often explicitly display the rationality behind repairs and reformulations of prior assertions, thus accomplishing accountability. Thus, 'doing maturity' emerges as the discursive effect of concessive repair practices.\ng345 | However, in line sixteen, Hal's aside to Don ('I did though (.) remember Kayla\"') and Andy and Don's celebration of it in lines seventeen to eighteen works yet again as a reassertion that undermines the maturity heard in the second concession. But because it is delivered as an afterthought (with Hal turning to Don and Andy and saying it with a downshift in voice), it carries a kind of off-the-record quality, marking its status as a direct or serious reassertion of the original proposition as ambiguous. The ambiguousness is essential for bringing off the hearable immaturity of reassertion without trouble. The laughter constructs the reassertion as both ironic, and thus less serious, but yet still invested to some degree in bragging about it. In other words, while the concession allows Hal and Don to counter the threat of appearing immature and overly preoccupied or naïve about looks, the design of the reassertion allows them to buy back into a kind of sexual interest that celebrates Hal's status as a heterosexual man ('luckiest man in the world') for having had a really pretty girl. By strategically employing concessive repairs, the boys are able to position themselves as mature while simultaneously attending to their interest in heterosexual attraction.\nsvhz | The next excerpt from a different group discussion involves a precarious negotiation of young males' interest in a particular girl whom they know from school and who they have characterized as someone who sleeps around a lot. In what follows, the moderator inquires about their potential interest in such a girl. Managing an interest is done in a delicate tongue-in-cheek way that protects them from appearing immature or desperate.\noaen | Excerpt four Participants: M: Moderator, B: Bob, D: Dirk; C: Carl\n5u67 | M: okay different question (.) and no need to uh (.) but isn't there\ndvms | two a little bit of attraction there in this kind of stuff\nqrd3 | three C: ((shakes head no))\nrxrg | four D: YEAH RIGHT\ntf43 | five B: NOT HER ((Dirk and Bob look at each other and smile))\nfcco | M: okay okay (.) okay okay (two point zero) I just was asking=\n8uji | six seven eight nine zero = seven eight nine\ndf3e | D: =attraction between :::: ((makes inquisitive smile face at moderator))\n53eu | M well (.) if I (.) if I (.) uhh (.) well I don't know (.)
