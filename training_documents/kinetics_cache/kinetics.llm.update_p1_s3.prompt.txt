You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

7szx | Genome-wide inference reveals that feedback regulations constrain promoter-dependent transcriptional burst kinetics
hx9e | ABSTRACT
ywn2 | Gene expression in mammalian cells is highly vari- able and episodic, resulting in a series of discontin- uous bursts of mRNAs. A challenge is to understand how static promoter architecture and dynamic feed- back regulations dictate bursting on a genome-wide scale. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA- seq) provides an opportunity to address this chal- lenge, effective analytical methods are scarce. We developed an interpretable and scalable inference framework, which combined experimental data with a mechanistic model to infer transcriptional burst ki- netics (sizes and frequencies) and feedback regula- tions. Applying this framework to scRNA-seq data generated from embryonic mouse fibroblast cells, we found Simpson's paradoxes, i.e. genome-wide burst kinetics exhibit different characteristics in two cases without and with distinguishing feedback reg- ulations. We also showed that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes and conceal the effects of transcription start site distributions on burst kinetics. Notably, only in the presence of positive feedback, TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies and enhancer-promoter in- teractions mainly modulate burst frequencies. The developed inference method provided a flexible and efficient way to investigate transcriptional burst ki- netics and the obtained results would be helpful for understanding cell development and fate decision.
a63r | INTRODUCTION
dqvj | The gene-expression variability resulting from programmed and stochastic processes has emerged as a central preoc-
r17u | cupation for investigating gene regulation (1,2). Genes are stochastically transcribed often in a discontinuous burst- ing manner (3,4). Transcriptional bursting is regarded as a primary proxy of stochasticity in gene expression and con- tributes to cell-to-cell variability (5-7), but the molecular mechanisms governing transcriptional bursting kinetics still remain elusive. Many experimental studies have provided evidence for linking static promoter architecture and se- quence to transcriptional bursting and, therefore, to the re- sulting variability in gene expression (5,8). This variability can propagate from mRNA to protein and further to the downstream target genes via a complex regulatory network (9,10). This raises important issues: On the genome-wide scale, how do static promoter regulatory sequences encode transcriptional burst kinetics, and how do dynamic gene regulatory networks shape burst kinetics?
3c47 | An intuitive view is that there is an indispensable link of gene-expression variability to promoter architecture (11,12). This link is due to the fact that a basic step of RNA synthesis is to copy the genetic information from the gene promoter. Much effort has been devoted to rational- izing the promoter-architecture encoding of transcriptional burst kinetics on genome-wide scales. For example, genes with TATA boxes increase variability in expression levels, whereas the presence of CpG island significantly lowers the variability (13-15). The sharp distributions of transcription start sites (TSS) lead to higher gene-expression variabil- ity than the broad TSS distributions (13). A recent study (16) has revealed that the increases in burst sizes are depen- dent on the presence of TATA box and initiator elements (characteristics of the core promoter), and burst frequencies are regulated by enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions. All these studies and others (17-21) indicate the importance of promoter architecture in modulating transcriptional burst kinetics.
g345 | Another viewpoint is that feedback regulations modu- late transcriptional burst kinetics by creating a higher-level
svhz | structure regulatory pattern (10). In fact, feedback regula- tions exist extensively in biological systems, and their func- tions may be reflected by the circuits of interacting genes and proteins (22). In particular, auto-regulatory feedback loops have been identified in various regulatory systems, where transcription factors directly or indirectly regulate the corresponding gene expression (23). In general, feed- backs can be categorized into positive and negative ones. Experimental investigations for a few genes or transcripts have demonstrated that different kinds of feedback played diverse roles (10). For example, negative feedback limits large expression variability and accelerates responses (24- 26). Conversely, positive feedback amplifies expression vari- ation, induces bimodal expression, and stimulates genes to 'active' states (27-30). In addition, negative feedback with a long delay loop can display increased variability (31). Theoretical analysis has also shown that different feed- back mechanisms modulate burst kinetics in different man- ners (32,33). All these studies indicate the important roles of feedback regulations in mediating gene expression, in- cluding transcriptional bursts, but it is unclear whether the results obtained for case-by-case studies can hold on a genome-wide scale.
oaen | The above two viewpoints are not solitary but are com- plementary to each other. A challenging task is to investi- gate how static promoter architecture and dynamic feed- back regulation coordinate transcriptional burst kinetics on a genome-wide scale. Previous studies of transcriptional bursting were limited to low-throughput experimental ap- proaches, where observed experimental results could not be generalized across different genes or cell types (34- 40). Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the in-depth measurement of expression lev- els within cell populations, providing an opportunity to study genome-wide transcriptional mechanisms (41). An important step toward this study is to develop mathemat- ical models for the genome-wide inference of burst kinetics. The models for inference should satisfy some requirements. First, these models should be interpretable, i.e. they can cap- ture essential gene-expression dynamics and convey kinetic information about transcriptional bursts (16,42-44) (https: //doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459173). Previous studies re- lied on inferring the direct correlations between features across molecular scales (13,45). However, these correlations are insufficient to uncover the mechanisms of gene expres- sion. Second, the inference models should be tractable, i.e. they can effectively treat a large number of cells and genes. In general, a complex mechanistic model incorporating reg- ulatory factors is difficult to analyze on the one hand (46), and a genome-wide inference needs expensive computa- tional cost on the other hand. Therefore, an interpretable and tractable inference framework integrating experimen- tal data and molecular mechanisms is strongly demanded.
5u67 | Here we developed a statistical framework based on the model-driven and data-driven combination to perform a scalable genome-wide inference. This framework used the static snapshots of scRNA-seq data to infer the regula- tory mechanisms underlying transcriptional burst kinetics. Specifically, it integrated the expected information on gene- expression variability, burst frequencies, burst sizes, and feedback regulation forms. Applying this inference method to the scRNA-seq data generated from embryonic mouse
dvms | fibroblast cells (16), we showed that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes, TATA genes are ex- pressed with high burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedback, feedback regulations conceal the effects of TSS distribution on transcriptional burst kinetics, and E- P interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies only in the presence of positive feedbacks. Briefly, we found that char- acteristics of genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics in the case without feedback regulations were different from those in the case with feedback regulations, implying Simp- son's Paradox, an interesting statistical phenomenon.
