You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

75y3 | On a flight from his home in Missouri to Washington, President Truman described his gut reaction to the news:
s2g2 | This was not the first occasion when the strong had attacked the weak. I recalled some earlier instances: Manchuria, Ethiopia, Austria. I remembered how each time that the democracies failed to act it had encouraged the aggressors to keep going ahead. Communism was acting in Korea just as Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese had acted ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to over-ride nations closer to our own shores. If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threats and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors. 13
q1q2 | Truman's advisers shared a similar mood. Upon arriving in Washington, Truman told secretary of defense Louis Johnson that he was going to "hit them hard." Johnson thanked him "in a voice broken with emotion." Acheson noted in his memoirs that by this stage, he believed that the attack had been instigated by the USSR "and that it would not be stopped by anything short of force."> Indeed, the discussions in the Blair House, which started immediately on Truman's return, reflected a high level of "intra-group solidarity" and "the finest spirit of harmony."" The decision to intervene in the war was taken shortly afterward without any objection.
cb7r | As a result, Janis regarded this decision-making process as a typical case of groupthink. It is important to note, however, that the discussions also lacked professional preparedness and coordination, " certainly the product of the complete surprise. Moreover, experts such as Kennan and the CIA Soviet analysts, who regarded the Kremlin's policy as more cautious, did not participate in the discussions." It is very possible that within this atmosphere of "they shall not pass" that dominated the discussions, their participation would have made no difference. But the atmosphere itself reflected the frustration of being caught unprepared by what seemed to be a clear case of Soviet aggression. 4
68xu | A timely warning about the North Korean attack could have allowed President Truman to resort to public deterrence. Without it, the US intervention in the war was almost inevitable.

2zpk | iii. The personal level
epu7 | Like in the case of Pearl Harbor, in which the blame for the mistaken assessment of the Japanese target was shared by everyone, there was no major individual culprit in the initial Korean failure. Hence, and in contrast to Barbarossa and Yom Kippur, the source of the failure is to be found at the other levels.
7od1 | d. Summary
0bqy | The complete American surprise at the North Korean invasion was the product of two factors. One was the low level of political, military, and intelligence attention that was given to the events in the Korean Peninsula once it was decided that South Korea had no real value for American strategy in the Far East. The other, which derived from the first, was the low level of intelligence collection and analysis concerning North Korea and the Communist bloc. The combination of these two, and the lack of expertise on Korean affairs in the administration, yielded this initial failure.

ccmb | Case Study II: Failure II: The Chinese Intervention of Fall 1950
ma93 | The North Korean offensive, which started in the early hours of June 25, was highly successful. Within less than three days, the KPA occupied Seoul and by June 30 most of the ROK army was lost. Under these circumstances, the goal of US-UN intervention in the war was defined by Acheson as "solely for the purpose of restoring the Republic of Korea to its status prior to the invasion of the north.""" The intervention by US Eighth Army prevented the complete occupation of South Korea and stabilized the Pusan Perimeter, which made up about 10 percent of the ROK territory.
c6hh | Operation Chromite, the landing at Inchon on September 15, turned the course of the war. Although many experts doubted its feasibility, 4 MacArthur's amphibious landing that combined the principles of surprise and indirect approach was a major operational success. Within two weeks, most of the KPA forces in South Korea disintegrated. X Corps, which landed in Inchon, joined forces with the Eighth Army that broke out of Pusan, and Seoul was recaptured. The main question became whether to exploit this success and cross the 38th parallel in order to unify the Korean Peninsula under a pro-American rule or to avoid making such a move for fear of Chinese or Soviet intervention in the war.
y7ea | The presidential decision-making process that led to the decision to expand the war to North Korea has been the subject of numerous studies that offer many strategic, domestic political, and psychological explanations for this ill-considered decision. The most critical factor in making the decision was the estimate of policymakers and intelligence experts of the likelihood of Soviet or Chinese military response, as was evident in the September 27 presidential directive. It allowed MacArthur to escalate the ground warfare into North Korea, "providing that at the time of such operation there was no entry into North Korea by major Soviet or Chinese Communist forces, no announcements of intended entry, nor a threat to counter our operations militarily."80
nav4 | Although MacArthur later received wider room for maneuverability, the risk of a major confrontation with the Chinese army remained the dominant consideration in the US strategy. One indication of Beijing's intentions was a series of public and diplomatic warnings, which started during the last week of September and threatened intervention if UN forces crossed the 38 parallel. Another indication was accumulating intelligence information about the buildup of PLA forces in Manchuria. Although the massive PLA crossing (about 280,000 soldiers) of the Yalu was missed by the American intelligence community, divisional attacks by the CPVF (Chinese People's Volunteers Force) that started on October 25 and lasted until November 8 constituted undeniable proof of a large-scale Chinese intervention in the war. Nevertheless, MacArthur's G-
gem8 | p. 145 2, Gen. Willoughby, continued until the very last moment to estimate that an all-out Chinese offensive was unlikely. Consequently, Washington gave the "green light," and toward the 4 end of November, MacArthur's UN forces resumed advancing northward into a huge Chinese ambush. The result was a successful CPVF counteroffensive that drove the UN forces south of the 38th parallel and caused the United States one of the worst defeats in its military history.
e8nr | As the discussion below will show, the failure to correctly estimate the magnitude of the Chinese threat in November 1950 had a number of sources. Essentially, however, it was the product of a lack of proper learning from past estimation failures in the war.

g9du | a. The Chinese road to war
f682 | The Chinese intervention in the war was the product of a rational decision-making process, which reflected a cautious calculus of military and political considerations. Militarily, the Chinese were well aware of their weaknesses. When making his decision to intervene by the CPVF, Mao wrote to Stalin that the American forces in Korea had over 1,500 guns of 70mm to 240 mm caliber, whereas the CPFV would have only 36 such guns. The American forces, moreover, had a complete control of the air, while the Chinese had just started training their air-force pilots."" The Soviet reluctance to provide the Chinese ground forces with air support almost led Mao to avoid intervention and brought a number of Chinese leaders-including Lin Biau, the foremost field army commander of the Chinese civil war and the natural candidate to head the CFPV-to object to this move.82
li1k | Politically, as Whiting's classic study suggested, the decision to intervene was mainly motivated by the desire to prevent the presence of a strong and determined enemy on China's doorstep. The Chinese leadership regarded a pro-Western unified Korea as the least desired and most dangerous outcome of the war. Mao also considered preserving North Korea as a Socialist state an important factor.35 The UN forces' fast advancement into 4 North Korea was perceived as a direct threat to China itself. Marshal Peng Dehuai, who headed the CPVF and who had participated in the October 2 meeting when Mao made the decision to intervene, gave this fear a vivid expression: "The tiger always wants people, and the time when it wants to eat depends on its appetite. Since America came to invade us, we had to resist its invasion."86
pbea | p. 146
ccpt | Paradoxically, the Chinese preparations for a military intervention were triggered by the North Korean military success during the war's first stage. Being aware of the vulnerability of the KPA because of its long supply lines, on August 5, the Central Military Commission under Mao ordered the PLA to complete war preparations before September 30. During the third week of August, high-ranking officers of the Chinese Operation Office and senior Foreign Ministry officials conducted a series of discussions and concluded that the American amphibious landing and counteroffensive was to be launched soon. Of six potential ports suitable for such a landing, Inchon was the most likely one. This estimate was delivered to the Chinese leaders on August 23, precisely the same day that MacArthur made his final decision to land at Inchon. A senior American civilian official in Japan noted in his memoirs that the fact that Inchon was the site of the planned landing "became almost an open secret in Tokyo." It is possible, then, that besides brilliant strategic thinking, the Chinese also had relevant intelligence information.
0fpw | Mao warned Kim Il Sung about the incoming American Inchon landing, but the KPA avoided taking the necessary measures to meet this threat and continued focusing on the occupation of the Pusan perimeter. 89 The decision to cross the Yalu and meet the UN forces in North Korea, which from the Chinese perspective constituted a preemptive strike, was taken during the first week of October, and the order to 4 "enter Korea immediately" was given on October 8. The crossing of the 260,000-strong force started on the night of October 18-19 and a first, unexpected, clash between a CPVF division and the Seventh Regiment of the Sixth ROK Division took place three days later. According to Chinese sources, during this first campaign the CPVF
dqn8 | p. 147
cop0 | eliminated about half a dozen ROK battalions as well as some small American forces. Due to insufficient fire power, the CPVF failed in reaching its original mission-annihilation of three enemy divisions."
lhkq | Following the first campaign, the Chinese generals began preparations for a larger one. In addition to resupplying and enforcing the CPVF, the Chinese generals implemented a deception plan, creating the impression that their forces were weak and were retreating in an unorderly manner to the Yalu. The goal was to lure MacArthur's forces to the north, extending their supply lines. The CPVF also released a hundred POWs, including some Americans, who were told that owing to supply problems, the Chinese forces had to return to China." MacArthur fell into the trap, and on November 25, a day after he had started his main offensive to end the war by Christmas, the CPFV launched a counteroffensive, causing the American army its worst defeat since the 1944 Battle of the Bulge. At its root was a major intelligence fiasco.

y2qo | b. The American surprise
1piq | i. The intelligence information and its estimate
7fqw | The poor state of American intelligence prior to the war did not change much after the war had started. This owed not only to the lack of adequate linguists and equipment but also rigid regulations, bureaucratic rivalry, and leadership deficiencies.95 The result during the war's first months was a low level of combat intelligence.
rhaz | Humint, which was of low quality prior to the invasion, was almost entirely wrecked when the KPA moved south, capturing, killing, or neutralizing whatever networks had been active before the war. Although according to one official history, Willoughby requested the CIA to bridge 4 the intelligence gap at the outset of the war,4 other sources emphasized his attempts to get rid of the CIA and take complete control.95 In any event, CIA and G-2 attempts to infiltrate agents into the occupied territories by line-crossing, parachuting, or boat landing failed. Most of the agents were lost and the information that was brought by the others was old and useless. Consequently, combat information from Humint sources came mainly from interrogations of refugees and of a few KPA POWs." Aerial reconnaissance was mainly used to support air bombings in North Korea and provided no significant support for the UN ground warfare.97
wak1 | p. 148
wtfz | Although AFSA moved to full shifts, Sigint provided only minor support to the fighting forces. During the war's first weeks, much attention was devoted to the Soviets. Only when it became evident that the USSR had made no preparations to intervene were twelve intercept positions transferred from Chinese and Soviet coverage to Korean duties. Here, COMMINT suffered from a shortage of high-quality monitoring equipment and skilled manpower. The entire US military had only 20 Korean-speaking linguists, and non- Americans linguists, primarily former Japanese intelligence officers, who had served in Korea, had to be used."" Willoughby, moreover, regarded his only duty to be providing intelligence to MacArthur.
qy1i | Consequently, he prevented, despite requests from Washington, the transfer of Sigint units to the Pusan perimeter. He also avoided distributing, allegedly for security considerations, operational intelligence to the Eighth Army, which was defending the Pusan parameter, thus denying its commander, Gen. Walton Walker, the information he needed to carry out his missions. The only Sigint support that the Eighth Army received was from an improvised South Korean unit called Group M. Despite its being plagued by many deficiencies
1k9e | p. 149 in training, expertise, and equipment, a sharp decline in KPA's radio security enabled Group M's 4 cryptologists since the end of July to solve the KPA's codes and cyphers within 24 hours after their weekly change. This locally improvised intelligence was used extensively by Walker and played a role in preventing the fall of the Pusan parameter.100
5bjs | The efforts to monitoring China, primarily its preparations for a massive intervention in the war, went somewhat better, and the source of the failure here lay within the sphere of analysis. Although the CIA had
uodj | p. 150
k16v | p. 151
b2lm | lost all its assets in mainland China following the Communist victory there, it succeeded in receiving some relevant information through other sources. On October 19, the same day the PLA started crossing the Yalu, a Hong Kong-based Chinese businessman warned that 400,000 PLA troops had started or were about to start crossing into North Korea.10 CIA officers in Tokyo warned twice of a 300,000-strong PLA force deployed near the Yalu.10 These warnings had no impact on intelligence estimates. MacArthur himself rejected them, and threatened to arrest a CIA officer stationed in Tokyo for warning about a coming Chinese intervention.103
ti7f | Aerial reconnaissance occasionally yielded some useful information. In early September, one warning indicator concerning possible Chinese intervention involved aerial photographs that showed three air-force bases, capable of handling a total of 300 aircraft, had been built in close proximity to the Yalu.104 104 On October 18, aerial photographs showed that close to a hundred Soviet-made aircraft had been deployed in those fields.105 The obvious conclusion should have been that the Chinese were building air support for a potential large-scale confrontation with the UN forces.
