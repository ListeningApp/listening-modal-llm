However, the hippocampus is a region well known for its ability to remodel synapses and generate new neurons, and volume loss in this region seems to be reversible. For example, treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, aside from improvement of stress disorder symptoms, has been found to lead to an increase in hippocampal volume, and it has been suggested that some of the behavioral effects of antidepressant treatment might depend on neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Future research will be needed to investigate whether similar neural mechanisms contribute to improvements in mental health following a medication-free behavioral intervention. We previously reported that changes in perceived stress were correlated with structural changes in the amygdala in a study that included subjects in the present study, and changes in stress were not correlated with changes in the hippocampus. However, the structural changes in the hippocampus identified here might be related to improvements in one of the other well-being-related variables that have been reported to improve following participation in an MBSR course.\n2zpk | The insula is known to be impacted in interoceptive/visceral awareness as well as in empathic responses. More generally, a recent review points to the fundamental role of the insula in human awareness, or consciousness. Given that mindfulness meditation constitutes training in interoception and conscious awareness, and based on the findings of previous studies which described functional as well as morphological differences in the insula between meditators and non-meditators, we hypothesized structural increases in the current study. However, the Pre-Post comparison within the MBSR group was not significant. It is possible that greater amounts of practice are required to produce structural changes in this region. It is also possible that previously identified differences between meditators and non-meditators were unrelated to the meditation training, but rather pre-existing. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that meditators did not show superior performance in an interoceptive task, challenging the assumption that enhanced cortical thickness and functional activation in the insula in meditators are related to better interoceptive awareness. Future studies that include a longer training program and assess interoceptive awareness Pre and Post intervention could help address these contradictory findings.\nepu7 | It has been suggested that the TPJ is a crucial structure for the conscious experience of the self, mediating spatial unity of self and body, or embodiment, and impaired processing at the TPJ may lead to the pathological experience of the self, such as disembodiment or out-of-body experiences. Furthermore, the TPJ is also involved in social cognition, i.e., the ability to infer states such as desires, intentions, and goals of other people, and there is evidence of greater activation of this region during feelings of compassion in meditators. Mindfulness training involves both the establishment of an awareness of oneself as a complete whole, and the cultivation of compassion. The morphological changes in the TPJ might be associated with increases in compassion attributed to meditation training and the cultivation of an embodied self.\n7od1 | Correspondingly, several studies suggest that the PCC is engaged when assessing the relevance or significance of a stimulus for oneself and it has been suggested to be particularly important for the integration of self-referential stimuli in the emotional and autobiographical context of one's own person. These functions also are closely related to mindfulness practice, which involves the introspective observation of phenomenal experiences as they are\n0bqy | encountered. Structural increases might be related to the repeated activation of this region during this process. Interestingly, the hippocampus, TPJ, and PCC as well as parts of the medial prefrontal cortex not identified in the present study form a brain network that supports diverse forms of self-projection, including remembering the past, thinking about the future, and conceiving the viewpoint of others. These abilities have been suggested to share a common set of processes, by which autobiographical information is used adaptively to enable the perception of alternative perspectives. Literature on the mechanisms of mindfulness proposes that the positive benefits of the practice might be mediated by a perceptual shift that modulates the internal representation of the self and it is possible that structural changes in the brain network involved in the projection of oneself into another perspective may underlie this perceptual shift.",
