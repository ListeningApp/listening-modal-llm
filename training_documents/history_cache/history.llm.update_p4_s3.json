The fact that Philipp's parents become very angry in the story may hint at another DSM-IV-TR criterion, i.e. the behavior of children suffering from ADHD often causes conflicts and a significant impairment in social functioning.\nzlxc | Another story in Hoffmann's \"Struwwelpeter\" relevant to the present review is that of \"Johnny Look-in-the-air\", which was added in the fifth edition in eighteen forty-seven. In this story, Hoffmann depicts a boy showing significant symptoms of inattention. Johnny was always \"looking at the sky and the clouds that floated by\" and was therefore \"often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli\". Johnny's inattentiveness resulted in the collision with an approaching dog and climaxed in an accident as \"Johnny watched the swallows\". He finally fell into a river.\nk0bw | Some authors are convinced that the stories of Johnny Look-in-the-air and Fidgety Phil are early descriptions of ADHD. However, Johnny Look-in-the-air's retropulsion of the head may also be interpreted as a description of a petit mal absence. Petit mal absences show a wide variety of mild to moderate motor accompaniment, and retropulsion of the head is quite common. There are also critics who advance the view that Hoffmann's Fidgety Phil is simply an example of a naughty child. Seidler refers to the fact that the final version of the scene's pictures published in eighteen fifty-nine, which is the artwork still used in modern editions, differs from the original version of eighteen forty-five. Seidler sees in the slightly different gestures of the protagonists a completely different situation, namely an open conflict between a father and his naughty, misbehaving son. The father's initial admonition provokes the son's deliberate defiant behavior indicated by eye contact and the active gripping of the tablecloth by the son. Hoffmann's storybook was published at a time when educational warning stories were very popular. Each of Hoffmann's stories demonstrates a child's misconduct leading to fatal consequences including death of the child. It is therefore possible that he wanted children to learn from his stories. Hoffmann's script is an illustrated children's book and he is therefore unlikely to have intended to address a broad medical readership and to describe a pathological condition. Since at his time the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity were not established as a psychiatric disorder, Hoffmann may have presented observations of conspicuous behavior without considering describing a disorder. One cannot\naq5a | conclude whether or not Hoffmann's described a case of ADHD in the early nineteenth century, since the story of Fidgety Phil is too short and the depicted behavioral features are not sufficient to establish the diagnostic criteria of ADHD. Fidgety Phil has nevertheless become a commonly used allegory for ADHD.\nsc5y | Defect of moral control (Sir George Frederic Still, eighteen sixty-eight to nineteen forty-one)\n0yab | The Goulstonian Lectures of Sir George Frederic Still in nineteen hundred two are by many authors considered to be the scientific starting point of the history of ADHD. Still was a British pediatrician who was born in Highbury, London, in eighteen sixty-eight. He became involved in research into childhood diseases and wrote several medical textbooks about his findings. The most widely known findings are his descriptions of a form of chronic joint disease in children, which today is called Still's disease. In nineteen hundred six, Still became the first professor of pediatrics in England at King's College Hospital London. In nineteen thirty-three, he was president of the first international pediatric congress. Still has therefore frequently been called the father of British pediatrics.\nw95z | In his Goulstonian Lectures, a series of three lectures to the Royal College of Physicians of London \"On Some Abnormal Psychical Conditions in Children\", Still discusses \"the particular psychical conditions which are concerned with an abnormal defect of moral control in children\". He defines moral control as \"the control of action in conformity with the idea of the good of all\". Still states that \"moral control is dependent upon three psychical factors, a cognitive relation to environment, moral consciousness, and volition\". Since both \"cognitive relation to environment\", which implies a \"capacity for reasoning comparison\", and moral consciousness are intellectual capacities, Still states that defective moral control as a morbidity can often be observed in cases of mentally retarded children. However, \"there are other cases which cannot be included in this category\" and which, as he points out, \"in particular call for careful observation\". They comprise the cases considered as historical descriptions of ADHD, i.e. children with a defect of moral control but without a \"general impairment of intellect\". Still divides these cases in two further groups, children with a \"morbid defect of moral control associated with\n0i1k | The history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\ndqlg | physical disease\", such as a cerebral tumor, meningitis, epilepsy, head injury or typhoid fever, and children with a \"defect of moral control as a morbid manifestation, without general impairment of intellect and without physical disease\". Some of the latter group, however, showed a \"history of severe cerebral disturbance in early infancy\". This differentiation was the origin of later concepts of brain damage, minimal cerebral dysfunction, and hyperactivity as historical precursors to ADHD.",
