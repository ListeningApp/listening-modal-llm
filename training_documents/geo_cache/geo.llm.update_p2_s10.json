        "content": "90no | Before the introduction of natural gas, town gas with a hydrogen content of more than fifty percent hydrogen was produced, transported and stored in Germany and Europe. Town gas was derived from coal, and its production still persists in China and Asia. When storage tanks could no longer meet the requirements of the gas industry, underground gas storage facilities were built in the porous geological subsurface starting from the nineteen fifties. Pore storage systems were launched in Beynes, France; Lobodice, Czech Republic; Engelbostel, Hannover; Reitbrook, Hamburg; Hähnlein, Darmstadt; Kirchheiligen, Mühlhausen/Tühringen; Eschenfelden, Fürth/Oberpfalz; Ketzin, Brandenburg even before the first salt caverns were put into operation in Bad Lauchstädt and Kiel in the nineteen seventies. Today, these underground storage facilities have been converted to natural gas storage facilities or have since been abandoned. Currently, pure hydrogen, greater than ninety-five percent hydrogen, is solely stored in salt caverns at a few sites, namely, Teesside, United Kingdom and Clemens Dome, United States; Spindletop, United States; and Moss Bloss, United States. Given this sparse and limited experience with hydrogen in pore storage systems, it is necessary to formulate recommendations for the safe handling of hydrogen in the subsurface.\njt0y | Two point two. Prospects for hydrogen network structures\nqb7o | The design of future hydrogen infrastructure and storage requirements in Germany remains uncertain and complex. It is challenging to analyze\noae5 | underground storage requirements and infrastructures in such a highly complex and swiftly evolving environment. While the German National Hydrogen Strategy was published in twenty twenty to promote the use of hydrogen in all sectors of the hydrogen economy, it didn't specify the design of the hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. To examine the potential use of underground hydrogen storage in porous media, three interdependent variables that could impact future storage requirements in Germany have to be considered: one, spatial distribution of hydrogen production via electrolysis; two, hydrogen demand centres; and three, hydrogen pipelines and import terminals.\ns0fl | Lux et al. investigated the positioning of electrolysers, underground storage and transport infrastructure in a greenhouse gas-neutral German energy system using five scenarios. Regardless of the scenario, their calculations indicate that seventy-one percent of the total hydrogen production in Germany will be located in the North and Baltic Seas, with a combined hydrogen production of eighty-three to one hundred twenty-nine terawatt-hours by two thousand fifty and total electrolyzer capacities of thirty-seven to fifty-five gigawatt-electrical. The concentration in these regions is due to the high potential for wind power, and it does not conflict with the alternative of expanding the electricity grid. Sens et al. report similar findings, as they calculate the second-lowest hydrogen supply cost at the North Sea, while Husarek et al. also support the idea of regional concentration, which contrasts with the results of Gils et al. Lux et al. demonstrate that hydrogen can serve as a seasonal and long-term storage medium, with a working gas volume of forty-two to one hundred four terawatt-hours of hydrogen in two thousand fifty. In contrast, Gils et al. report a required storage capacity of fifty-three terawatt-hours in the same year. In the modelled energy systems, hydrogen storage levels decrease during winter when renewable electricity generation is lower and increase in summer with higher renewable electricity feed-in. This seasonal profile for hydrogen storage has been identified in previous studies by Gils et al. and Welder et al. for Germany, and Cárdenas et al., Samsatli and Samsatli, Gabrielli et al., and Hernandez and Gençer for different regions or countries. Large-scale storage directly on site or at the end of a transport pipeline at the demand location can reduce hydrogen costs by decreasing excess electricity.\n43ia | In order to establish a cost-effective hydrogen economy and a greenhouse-gas neutral energy system in the long run, a Germany-wide transport network is necessary. However, the design of such a network and the routing of its pipelines is still up for debate. Although detailed expansion plans differ, there is consensus in the literature on the need to connect production hubs and import terminals in the North with demand centers in the South of Germany. The European gas network operators have proposed a European-wide hydrogen pipeline vision (hydrogen backbone), which focuses on the repurposing of existing natural gas infrastructures. For example, in Germany, a North-South pipeline from Rostock to Lake Constance is planned to be established from two thousand thirty-five onwards, repurposing the existing natural gas infrastructure, which is considered more cost effective than building new pipelines. The repurposing of pipelines and port\n3g2y | infrastructure is also a part of the IPCEI Hydrogen initiative (important projects of common European interests). The association of the supra-regional gas transmission companies in Germany (FNB Gas) develops a joint network development plan every two years, which is then submitted to the German Federal Network Agency. The twenty twenty-two plan models a national hydrogen network in Germany, based on a survey of transportation needs. However, due to the current regulatory framework, this network is not legally binding. The twenty twenty plan only contained a rough outline of a visionary hydrogen network, in contrast to the more detailed model presented in the twenty twenty-two plan.\ngc7v | Assessing hydrogen storage requirements is a multi-faceted endeavour that includes an evaluation of potential future hydrogen demand and its regional distribution. Future hydrogen demand is still uncertain, while Lux et al. indicate a range of hydrogen demand scenarios between thirty-four and six hundred sixty-seven terawatt-hours, final energy demand in two thousand fifty, attributable to different usage categories such as industry, transport, and heating. To derive a more comprehensive estimate, Neuwirth et al. conducted a site- and process-specific bottom-up analysis of hydrogen demand from the energy-intensive sectors alone, revealing a potential hydrogen demand of three hundred twenty-six terawatt-hours per annum. The spatial distribution of this demand is heterogeneous, with concentration in a few regions. Consequently, we posit that underground hydrogen storage is more likely in these regions, given that they are probable endpoints for pipelines, and industry clusters require an economic and steady hydrogen supply, which can be secured through storage.\nwqfv | Three.
