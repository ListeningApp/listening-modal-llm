        "content": "jkp9 | Compared to the other proposition, the spiral mapping results in higher variational energy, likely the result of the inhomogeneous entanglement distribution. Since entanglement can be created by nonlocal transformations, it is known that certain mappings from two-D to one-D are beneficial compared to others, which can be utilized to obtain a substantial improvement of the overall simulation quality. For the results presented in the main text, we consistently use the zigzag order. The phase diagram presented is entirely unaffected by this choice.\nz8tt | A basic understanding of the classical low-energy configurations can be achieved by performing a variational minimization of the energy functional. In particular, we want to solve for the minimum energy spin configuration which satisfies\n9g22 | Emin equals open curly brace S semicolon Vi equals one, and so on up to N close curly brace minimum E open parenthesis S one, S two, and so on, S N close parenthesis\n41fx | in which E is the classical energy functional\n7um8 | E equals equals two greater than open bracket J S period SP plus D r-r period open parenthesis S comma x SP close parenthesis close bracket plus greater than B period S comma\nuow2 | open parenthesis r comma r close parenthesis\niat7 | sharing the same notational conventions with the quantum Hamiltonian, except the use of classical spins. We implemented a standard variational optimization with the Optim julia package, which is included in our repository. All variational techniques are prone to being trapped in local\nywwr | minima, which sensibly depends on the initial state. To be sure that for small sixty-one-spin flakes we obtain samples of a global minimum energy configuration, we performed the variational optimization with one thousand different initial states where the azimuth and polar angles are sampled with a uniform distribution. The low energy results of the classical setup are obtained analogously to the quantum case: We analyze the lowest energy configurations as a response to a changing external Zeeman field, for which we fix the norm of the classical spins to one-half. We present a condensed version of the classical low energy results.\n0i6j | We find that the spectral energy and magnetization lines of the different configurations as a function of B over modulus D are continuous over a wide range of parameters in the phase diagram. In particular, the spectral lines show crossings, which we identify with a phase transition: the first excited states become ground states and vice versa, causing the sudden jumps in the magnetization. This simple analysis suggests first-order Zeeman field induced phase transitions in this model, which are conjectured to be present in the quantum case as well.\n87cq | If we compare the ranges of the skyrmion phase between quantum and classical, then we note that the quantum\n0qs3 | QUANTUM SKYRMION LATTICES IN HEISENBERG ...\nz8f7 | skyrmions are ground states in the regions of the classical field polarized states, which is in agreement with the results\n7w7j | presented, namely that quantum fluctuations stabilize skyrmion textures.\n51vd | zero four three one one three dash twelve\nbaj1 | QUANTUM SKYRMION LATTICES IN HEISENBERG ...",
