You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

wwdt | DISCUSSION
mn1r | Our study provides insights on trends in the SES research field in terms of the terminology used, journals being published in, the type of research, where it is being done and by whom, topics being investigated, and the methods being used. Although a number of reviews (Brandt et al. 2013, Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019) exploring

meyw | similar issues have recently been published, our analysis takes a particularly broad view, and specifically focuses on the methods used in SES field through a list of method "categories" or typologies, also assessing the extent to which they account for the underlying organizing principles of CAS. Here we discuss five broad conclusions from these results, and their implications for advancing SES research.

75y3 | SES research is growing rapidly, but is still unevenly distributed Similar to other reviews on SES and related fields (Brandt et al. 2013, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019), we note significant increases in SES research over the last three decades, relative to the growth of scientific publications overall (Fig. 2). SES research is clearly spanning the social and natural sciences in terms of the subject fields of the main journals in which this research is being published (Fig. 3). The interdisciplinary journal Ecology and Society has become a dominant outlet, especially in recent years (Fig. 3). Its dominance may be partly attributed to being one of the earliest open access, online-only journals in the SES field. More recently (and not reflected in our results because of the time span analyzed), a number of new journals have been established in the SES field, including People and Nature (British Ecological Society), Ecosystems and People (Taylor & Francis), and One Earth (Cell Press). These provide further evidence of the maturing of the SES field, and potentially broadening the core set of journals publishing SES research. This maturation is perhaps also evident from the analysis of key SES research terms, which reveals a variety of common terms used to describe the interactive relationship between human societies and the natural environment, and appears to currently be consolidating around the terms "nature society relations,""social- ecological," and "socio-ecological" (Fig. 1). Consolidation around key terms and concepts is central to the development of new research fields (Guo et al. 2011).

cb7r | (USA), Wageningen University (Netherlands) and James Cook University (Australia). The top 20 research institutions conducting SES are all based in the Global North (mirroring the results of Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), but SES being studied are more globally distributed (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, there are still large parts of the Earth where relatively little SES is being undertaken (Fig. 5). These include island regions such as the Caribbean, Indian Ocean Islands, Oceania, and inaccessible regions such as Antarctica. However, several populous regions are also little studied, including Central Africa, East Africa, West Africa, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Several of these regions are undergoing rapid population growth and environmental change, experiencing pressing sustainability issues, and increasingly influencing regional and global changes in nature society relations. Better understanding context-specific SES dynamics in these regions to inform local and regional sustainability-related policies and actions is therefore a priority. Encouragingly, however, some of the places with the most SES research include Southern Africa and Asia, regions that are often not that well represented in environmental and social research more generally (Rodríguez-Pose 2006, Trimble and van Aarde 2012).
68xu | SES research is dominated by place-based research at local to regional scales
hd35 | Our results point to the frequent use and development of new frameworks in SES research. Of all 5098 published papers assessed, 15.18% were framework papers, and only 1.39% were purely theoretical. The bulk (13.79%) proposed frameworks that

epu7 | were applied to place-based systems, which may also suggest that the popularization of the term "social-ecological" systems was probably influenced by explicitly place-based frameworks (Colding and Barthel 2019). Although the high number of framework studies might be an indication that SES research is still in a developmental phase (counter to our earlier point), the strong place-based focus in the development of these frameworks suggests that customizing frameworks for new social-ecological contexts may be a characterizing feature of SES research. Colding and Barthel (2019) assert that many frameworks used in SES research are adaptations of three core frameworks; that of Ostrom (2007, 2009), Folke and Berkes (1998) and Berkes et al. (2003), and the robustness framework (Anderies 2004, 2007). All three of these have an explicit CAS-based underpinning.

0bqy | Although a CAS lens is by no means the only way to conceptualize SES, it has become the most popular (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser et al. 2018). Our timeline analysis shows the most significant inflection point in the rise of SES research to lie between 1999 and 2000, which coincides with the establishment of the Resilience Alliance in 1999 (Folke 2006, Parker and Hackett 2012), and the initial publication of their affiliate journal Ecology and Society, which has published more SES research than any other journal (Fig. 3). The Resilience Alliance in particular, and Ecology and Society by association, relies heavily on CAS and resilience as key guiding frameworks (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser et al. 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). Our results thus align with other studies that have highlighted the dominance of a CAS framing in influencing SES research (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser et al. 2018). Given the theoretical maturity of CAS (Preiser et al. 2018), we argue that a definition of SES as CAS, as attempted by Preiser et al. (2018), offers a pragmatic step toward a more universal definition of SES, often lamented as missing in the field (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Partelow 2018, Colding and Barthel 2019). This is not to say, however, that CAS thinking is sufficient to support SES research, or that it excludes the use and integration of other frameworks.
b780 | SES research is centered on pressing sustainability issues
ccmb | Key words identified in our study, similar to those found in related reviews (Brandt et al. 2013, Capstick et al. 2015, Droste et al. 2018, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), emphasize a focus of SES research on pressing sustainability issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, livelihoods, poverty, policy, land use change, water, and social and environmental justice (Fig. 6). Our change point analysis shows notable inflection points around 1990 and 2000, years that follow calls to address global Earth system changes and move toward "sustainable development of the Biosphere" (Clarke and Munn 1986, Keeble 1988). The smaller upsurge post-2010 can likely be attributed to the integration of SES with broader sustainability initiatives (Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018), such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Future Earth initiative and its core research programs such as the Program on Ecosystem Change and Society (PECS), and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
ma93 | A strong integration of SES research with societal issues (Turner et al. 2016) affirms calls for the development of stronger science- society interfaces (Fischer et al. 2015, Tengö et al. 2017) to guide research, knowledge cocreation, and decision making (Turner et al. 2016). However, as many researchers have recognized, taking a knowledge coproduction approach to understanding SES and supporting policy and decision making can be demanding. Aside from the time required to establish relationships with knowledge partners, particularly when operating in transdisciplinary teams that seek evidence from multiple knowledge platforms (Tengö et al. 2014, 2017), challenges also arise from the inherent methodological pluralism that characterizes the SES research field (Turner et al. 2016, Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018, Preiser 2018). Furthermore, if we accept that seeking evidence from multiple knowledge traditions (Tengö et al. 2014, Díaz et al. 2015a, b) represents a more ethical approach to understanding SES, we have to be cognizant of the fact that much of our current academic knowledge for understanding SES has been generated in the Global North (also see Herrero-Jáuregui et al. 2018). This
c6hh | highlights a more general need for developing academic voices from the global south.
y7ea | Many different methods from a variety of disciplines inform SES research
nav4 | That methods from many different disciplines are used in SES research is perhaps intuitive, but our study provides a strong empirical validation of this statement, and by virtue of our typology, an accessible overview of the kinds of methods that are used in the field. Our study identified 311 methods (reduced from an initial list of 632) that we grouped into 27 categories, or types, of methods that are commonly used in SES research, providing empirical support for the notion of methodological pluralism in SES research.
gem8 | Within the place-based studies that we analyzed, we found that spatial mapping and analysis, historical profiling and reconstruction, interviews, and futures analysis were most commonly used (Fig. 7). The use of these methods may be partly driven by the most common SES research topics, including policy, trade, conservation, adaptation, and land use change (Fig. 6b) because they are the most common methods we found to be used to investigate these topics (Table 3). Interestingly, interviews and participatory data collection were much more commonly used than ecological field data collection (Fig. 7), but this may because ecological field data collection methods are often not articulated in the abstracts of, for example, papers that assess land use change. Economic and other decision-support methods were also quite widely used, including impact analysis, livelihood and vulnerability analysis, and decision analysis. This provides further support for the importance of the increasing emphasis on the science-policy interface and knowledge coproduction in SES research. In contrast, state-and-transition analysis, systems scoping, and games were much more rarely used. These are methods that are particularly well suited to the study of SES (Schultz et al. 2007, Janssen et al. 2010, Provencher et al. 2016, Edwards et al. 2019), but may not have been as well-represented in our dataset on account of their categories containing fewer specific methods, a general limitation of our study.
e8nr | Our typology of methods spanning different disciplines can provide some orientation to early-career researchers to navigate the methodological pluralism that characterizes the SES field. For new researchers entering the field, a key challenge relates to knowing which methods could be used to investigate a particular SES research question (Haider et al. 2018). Our list of method categories offers researchers a manageable overview of potential tools they might employ in their research, and provides a foundation for scholarly engagement around methodological integration.
k78w | Methods used in SES research account for the underlying characteristics of CAS to varying degrees
g9du | To gain deeper insight into the suitability of methods used in SES research in accounting for the CAS nature of SES, the authors used a thought exercise to map the different method typologies onto the six organizing principles of CAS, as identified by Preiser et al. (2018; Table 4). There are obvious limitations to such an approach, most notably that our assessment was limited by the knowledge of the author team about different methods and the contexts in which they are applied. Nevertheless, the exercise yielded several insights that could be explored in future research on the nature of SES research.
f682 | Ecology and Society 24(4): 16 https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol24/iss4/art16/
li1k | A number of the methods highlighted in our review, such as network analysis and agent-based modeling, are particularly well suited to explore relationality in SES (Preiser et al. 2018). Both network analysis and agent-based modeling are used extensively in SES research (Fig. 7), and offer integrative frameworks that capture relations and connectivity, can help to develop rich pictures, and deal with heterogeneity and redundancy (Janssen et al. 2006, Bodin and Crona 2009, An 2012, Filatova et al. 2013). Agent-based modeling and network analysis are process- orientated models that rely on decentralized control and automata to detect and create emergent patterns, and so do well to account for the adaptive and self-generating organizational capacities of CAS.
pbea | Generally, the methods used in SES research have been sensitive to the context-dependency of SES challenges, probably helped by the notion that SES research has emerged from place-based local- scale studies (Colding and Barthel 2019). Many methods used in anticipatory future studies are adept at adapting frameworks to context, and specifically focus on anticipating adaptation and change (Berkhout et al. 2002, Carpenter et al. 2006, Shaw et al. 2009, Sheppard et al. 2011). These methods, and other participatory research methods that gather multiple evidence- based knowledge (Tengö et al. 2014) can help with observer- dependent framing (Shirk et al. 2012)
