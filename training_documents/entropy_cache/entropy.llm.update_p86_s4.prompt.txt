You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

aeaj | Now let's turn to our ultimate goal: computing the entropy of a box of gas. As a warmup, let's figure out the entropy of a single particle in a box. In fact, let's start with a a free classical particle in a one-dimensional box: that is, in some interval [0, L].
tlut | The first step is to compute its partition function. As you can see, this is easy enough. But the whole idea raises some questions. Some people get freaked out by the concept of entropy for a single particle I guess because it involves probability theory for a single particle, and they think probability only applies to large numbers of things.
izqq | I sometimes ask these people "how large counts as large?" In fact the foundations of probability theory are just as mysterious for large numbers of things as for just one thing. What do probabilities really mean? We could argue about this all day: Bayesian versus. frequentist interpretations of probability, etc. I said a tiny bit about this before, and I won't say more now.
r93i | Large numbers of things tend to make large deviations less likely. For example the chance of having all the gas atoms in a box all on the left side is less if you have 1000 atoms than if you have just 2. This makes us worry less about using averages and probability.
milo | But the math of probability works the same for small numbers of particles-even one particle! Even better, knowing the entropy of one particle in a box will help us understand the entropy of a million particles in a box-at least if they don't interact, as we assume for an 'ideal gas'.
hs4w | But why just a one-dimensional box? The answer is that particle in a 3-dimensional box is mathematically the same as 3 noninteracting distinguishable particles in a one- dimensional box! The x, y, and z coordinates of the 3d particle act like positions of three 1d particles.
voba | PARTICLE IN A BOX: EXPECTED ENERGY
tyxu | A classical free particle of mass <LATEX>m</LATEX> in a 1d box of length <LATEX>L</LATEX> has partition function
q342 | <LATEX>Z = \frac { L } { h } \sqrt { \frac { 2 \pi m } { \beta } }</LATEX> The expected energy of any system in thermal equilibrium is
au1k | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = - \frac { d } { d \beta } \ln Z</LATEX> So, by the miracle of basic calculus, we get
jt2s | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { 1 } { 2 \beta } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } k T</LATEX> as we'd expect from the equipartition theorem!
p530 | We worked out the partition function of a classical free particle in a 1-dimensional box. From this we can work out its expected energy. Look how simple it is! It's just <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } k T ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>k</LATEX> is Boltzmann's constant and <LATEX>T</LATEX> is the temperature!
zxwg | Why is the final answer so simple? We can use the chain rule
di8f | <LATEX>\frac { d } { d \beta } \ln Z = \frac { 1 } { Z } \frac { d Z } { d \beta }</LATEX> to see that only the power of <LATEX>\beta</LATEX> in
1ipu | <LATEX>Z = \frac { L } { h } \sqrt { \frac { 2 \pi m } { \beta } }</LATEX> matters, not all the constants: these constants show up in <LATEX>d Z / d \beta ,</LATEX> but also in <LATEX>1 / Z ,</LATEX> and they cancel. The length <LATEX>L ,</LATEX> the mass <LATEX>m ,</LATEX> Planck's constant <LATEX>h ,</LATEX> the factor of <LATEX>2 \pi \ldots .</LATEX> none of this junk matters! Not for the expected energy, anyway. Because <LATEX>Z</LATEX> is proportional to <LATEX>\beta ^ { - 1 / 2 } ,</LATEX> we simply get
o68o | <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = \frac { 1 } { 2 } k T .</LATEX> More generally, if the partition function of a system is proportional to <LATEX>\beta ^ { - c } ,</LATEX> its expected energy will be
rvp9 | <LATEX>c k T :</LATEX> <LATEX>Z \propto \beta ^ { - c } \Longrightarrow \langle E \rangle = c k T .</LATEX> But when is the partition function of a system proportional to <LATEX>\beta ^ { - c }</LATEX> It's enough for the system's energy to be a positive definite quadratic form in <LATEX>n</LATEX> real variables-which physicists call 'degrees of freedom'. Then <LATEX>c = n / 2 .</LATEX> We've already seen an example with 2 degrees of freedom: the classical harmonic oscillator. We saw that in this example <LATEX>Z \propto 1 / \beta .</LATEX> This gives <LATEX>\langle E \rangle = k T .</LATEX> But the result is quite general:
wwgc | Puzzle 45. Suppose we have a system with state space <LATEX>\mathbb{R} ^ { n }</LATEX> and energy function <LATEX>E : \mathbb{R} ^ { n } \rightarrow</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathbb{R}</LATEX> that is a positive definite quadratic form, so that
bjgk | <LATEX>E \left( x \right) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \| A x \| ^ { 2 }</LATEX> for some invertible <LATEX>n \times n</LATEX> matrix <LATEX>A .</LATEX> Show that its partition function is proportional to <LATEX>\beta ^ { - c }</LATEX> where
vz7z | <LATEX>c = n / 2 .</LATEX> In fact, this is just a new outlook on our friend the equipartition theorem.
wk43 | Here's another thing to consider. While our particle in a <LATEX>1 \mathrm { d }</LATEX> box has 2 degrees of freedom-position and momentum-its energy depends on just one of these, and quadratically on that one. So its expected energy is <LATEX>\frac { 1 } { 2 } n k T</LATEX> where <LATEX>n = 1 ,</LATEX> not
1002 | <LATEX>n = 2 .</LATEX> So here's another puzzle for you:
