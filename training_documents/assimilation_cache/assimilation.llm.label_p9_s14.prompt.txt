You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

p6pq | The data influence only the forecasting and filtering means but not the variance ma- trices which, in principle, can all be computed in advance. In practical applications, the problem of computing or estimating the covariance matrices becomes important. For those <LATEX>i</LATEX> for which no observations are available, the filtering distribution and the forecast- ing distribution agree.
zse6 | The basic reanalysis Algorithm 20.2 can also be rewritten in terms of matrix opera- tions for this situation [121].
p2n3 | 20.6 - Numerical Example
ohh7 | The following numerical example illustrates the results of Kalman filtering and reanalysis. The example uses the one-dimensional process model <LATEX>x _ { i } = \alpha x _ { i - 1 } + \xi _ { i }</LATEX> for <LATEX>i = 1 , \ldots , 3 0 ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\alpha = 0 . 8</LATEX> and
vbni | <LATEX>\xi _ { i } \sim N \left( 0 , q ^ { 2 } \right) , \quad q = 0 . 4 .</LATEX> The value <LATEX>x _ { 0 }</LATEX> is drawn from a standard normal distribution. A typical sequence is plotted in black in Figure 20.2. The data model is <LATEX>y _ { i } = b _ { i } x _ { i } + \zeta _ { i } ,</LATEX> where
dgcw | <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \zeta _ { i } \sim N \left( 0 , r ^ { 2 } \right) , \quad r = 0 . 1 ; \quad h _ { i } = \left\{ \begin{array}{} 0 . 1 , \quad i = 1 1 , \ldots , 2 0 , & \\ 1 , \quad i = 1 , \ldots , 1 0 , 2 1 , \ldots , 3 0 . & \end{array} \right. } \end{array} ,</LATEX> The data model is set up so that for <LATEX>i = 1 1 , \ldots , 2 0 ,</LATEX> there is a period of "low observability." Figure 20.2 shows a single realization of the true process, the filtering estimates, and the reanalysis estimates. It is clear that these estimates are not the same. As expected, all estimates are much closer to the true values where

During the interval of low observability (i = 11, ... ,20), all these standard deviations are larger. Also plotted in the same figure (thin lines) are the forecasting errors x; - xili-1 (black), filtering errors x; - Xii (blue), and reanalysis errors x; - XIN (red) for a single realization.
4jmz | 20.7 . Extensions
b7cq | The Kalman filter and reanalysis algorithms have theoretical and practical limitations if the error distributions are not Gaussian or if the process model is nonlinear. In the latter case, even Gaussian errors typically become immediately non-Gaussian, and biases (sys- tematic errors) appear. Another practical difficulty arises because in weather forecasting or climate science temporal and spatial features may lead to state variables with millions of components, with error covariance matrices with 1012 or more entries.
0b39 | 20.7.1 - Extended Kalman Filter
qecd | Nonlinear process and data models are often handled by linearization. The resulting al- gorithm is known as the extended Kalman filter. In essence, it uses the nonlinear process model (without noise terms) to compute the forecasting estimate and uses linearization about the most recent filtering estimate to compute the forecasting covariance and the gain matrix. The filtering estimate and its covariance are then computed from these quantities more or less in the same way as in Algorithm 20.3. This approach works well in engineer- ing applications with a modest number of process variables but quickly becomes infea- sible in high-dimensional situations. Variational methods for data assimilation that were mentioned earlier can avoid these difficulties but do not readily produce an assessment of errors.
1o7p | 20.7.2 - Ensemble Kalman Filter
cp13 | The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKf), introduced in the 1990s, uses stochastic simulation techniques known as Monte Carlo methods; [21] is a review article by one of the inventors of EnKf. The archetypical use for a Monte Carlo approach is the computation of an expected value & F (X) of a random variable X with density fx(x). Formally, the definition is &F(X) = [ F(x)fx(x)dx, where the integral is over the space in which X takes its values. Numerical computation of the integral is essentially impossible if the dimension of X exceeds 10 or so. In a Monte Carlo approach, one draws m independent random samples x(1 : m) from the distribution of X and approximates the expected value,
bgre | F(x(i)). (20.22)
57lp | By the law of large numbers, the right-hand side converges almost surely to the correct expected value as m -> 0, and the speed of convergence can be determined (it is always slow).
ukth | For a simple version of EnKf, we assume a nonlinear process model,
kpvt | X(i) = M;(X(i-1) + E;
jie2 | (20.23)
d0ik | where the M; are functions from the range of the X(i) to itself. All other assumptions are left unchanged-the model errors ; are Gaussian, there is a linear data model (20.17),

xh3i | and the background state is Gaussian, X(0) ~ N(u,2). Suppose we are given an estimate & ;_ 1|i-1 of the filtering mean at i-1, an estimate [ ;_ ][-] of the filtering covariance matrix at this time step, and an estimate N($ ;_ ][-], [-][-1) of the distribution of X(i -1)|y(1 : i -1). For the simulation, draw m independent samples x. Xi-1|i-1 (j =1, ... , m) from this distribution, propagate them forward with the process, and add simulated model errors n; ~ N(O, Q;) that have the same distribution as the model errors &; at this time step. The result is an ensemble of simulated forecasts,
syiw | X ili-1 = Mi(xili- ' ¡_ 1) +nj, j = 1 , ... , m. (20.24)
kg3t | The forecasting estimate is now computed as the sample mean of this ensemble,
lvae | Ã ¡- 1 m 1 j=1 m
o9sc | and the sample covariance matrix provides an estimate Žili-1 of the forecasting covari- ance matrix. Next, compute the gain matrix, just as in (20.20) but with the estimated covariance,
121u | R; = $ ¡¡ ¡ HT (HTS ¡¡ ¡ H; +R;)1. (20.26)
zh03 | To compute a filtering estimate, the ensemble of forecasts is adjusted using an innova- tion term and gain matrix as in Eq. (20.19). There is only one observation y(i) avail- able, but it turns out that using it unchanged for all innovations in the ensemble tends to underestimate the variability of the filtering distribution. Hence, the innovation term y(i)-Hi Mili-1 in the ordinary Kalman filter is replaced by an innovation ensemble y(i) + e .- H;x, where the perturbations e; are simulated observation errors with the same dis- tribution as the errors in the data model (20.17). One can therefore compute an ensemble of simulated filtering states,
1mvw | Ex ¡- 1 +R; (y(i) +e; - H[-]. (20.27)
6d4s | This ensemble is used to produce estimates &j ; of the filtering mean and 2 ;; of the filtering covariance matrix. One then uses N( *¡ , [i) as an estimate of the filtering distribution at time step i, and the algorithm has completed a step. There is also a reanalysis version of this method.
mqah | If the process model is actually linear, such that Eq. (20.23) reduces to Eq. (20.16), then the ensemble Kalman forecasting and filtering estimates converge in the limit of large ensemble size to those of the ordinary Kalman filter algorithm. However, if the M; are nonlinear, then the forecasting and filtering distributions become non-Gaussian, and there will be biases from the ensemble approach that do not disappear with large ensemble size. These biases must be assessed or possibly corrected separately.

ncb0 | If the space of process variables is high-dimensional <LATEX>\left( 1 0 ^ { 6 } \right.</LATEX> or <LATEX>1 0 ^ { 8 }</LATEX> is not uncommon), the ensemble approach successfully avoids the problem of high-dimensional integration and the manipulation of huge covariance matrices. However, typically the ensemble size is much smaller, perhaps <LATEX>m = 0 \left( 1 0 ^ { 2 } \right) .</LATEX> Then the sample covariance matrices have rank at most <LATEX>m</LATEX> and cannot possibly give all covariances correctly. On the other hand, in such situations the process vector <LATEX>\mathrm { x } \left( i \right)</LATEX> may describe physical quantities at different locations across a region or around the globe. Then one often multiplies <LATEX>\sum _ { i | i - 1 } ^ { \wedge }</LATEX> or <LATEX>\sum _ { i | i } ^ { \wedge }</LATEX> elementwise with a "cut-off" matrix <LATEX>C</LATEX> whose entries are small far from the diagonal (for component pairs that have little to do with each other). This trick eliminates spurious large correla- tions at distant locations and at the same time tends to restore full rank to the estimated covariance matrices. Care must be taken to avoid destroying teleconnections.
8mp0 | The EnKf is now widely used. Many versions have been developed, and the literature has grown quite large; [49] is a recent overview by one of the leading experts.
