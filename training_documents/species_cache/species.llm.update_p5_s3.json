Species ranges are naturally modified through migration and propagule dispersal or often through long-distance dispersal events assisted by wind or water currents, or other organisms, without necessarily involving environmental changes. Human-induced environmental changes may increase the accessibility or suitability of a region for a given species, which may allow for new geographical areas to be colonized. Assessing the contribution of human-induced environmental change to range expansion will mostly be based on circumstantial evidence such as a close match between the ecological requirements of a species and the recent change in the recipient environment brought about by environmental change and attributes of the range expansion process. It is often difficult to ascertain the degree of indirect influence of human agency on species range expansion. However, it is likely that only few species that are currently expanding do so without responding to human-induced environmental change. For practical purposes, we therefore propose that evidence that the spread of a species is due to human-induced environmental change is sufficient to qualify a species to fulfill this criterion, whereas evidence that range expansion is not due to human-induced environmental change should be used for identifying species that expand their ranges naturally. However, an estimate of uncertainty of the assessment should be provided. The near ubiquity of anthropogenic impacts in the Anthropocene means that under these circumstances, it may be much harder to distinguish species that are expanding their ranges independently of environmental change.\nk0bw | Finally, the absence of direct human-mediated dispersal for range expansion or the creation of human-made dispersal corridors is a prerequisite for a taxon to qualify as range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change. Such human agency includes the intentional or unintentional anthropogenic transport of propagules or individuals from the native range or from a previously colonized alien range or increasing region accessibility via the construction of corridors that connect previously separated regions. These processes may aid or allow the colonization of regions that have become newly suitable for a species. In many situations, human agency and indirect human-induced environmental change may synergistically enable species-range expansion and attributing their relative importance may be difficult. If human agency other than human-induced environmental change is involved, the respective taxon should be considered alien. In addition to these defining characteristics, a range of other features is associated with the phenomenon of range-expanding native species.\naq5a | Range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change compared with alien species\nsc5y | Range expansion of species responding to human-mediated environmental change and biological invasions have common features, but they differ qualitatively and quantitatively in key processes. For the former, individuals colonizing new geographic space are usually drawn from the leading edge of the historic native range, with concomitant consequences. Therefore, populations in newly colonized regions may also differ in these traits from the source populations. Range expansion may be driven by widely different numbers of individuals, and if numbers are low which is often the case, bottleneck and founder effects are frequent and may result in reduced genetic diversity.\n0yab | In contrast, alien species may be drawn from a wide range of source populations, which are often located in the central parts of their range, and repeated introductions from different source populations are a widespread phenomenon. Furthermore, postintroduction evolution in the new range because of different selection pressure and limited gene exchange with native populations has repeatedly been documented. This is probably more relevant for alien species, because they typically encounter substantially different selection pressures in\nw95z | the new region, whereas range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change colonize regions adjacent to their historic range with smaller differences in selection pressures. However, it has been shown that native species expanding their ranges in response to climate warming experience less control by natural enemies than long-term resident natives. Therefore, populations of alien species in their new range may be more e.g., as a consequence of repeated introductions and admixture or less genetically diverse and substantially different from those in their native range, depending on the direction and strength of the relevant selection processes. However, there are many cases in which alien populations have reduced genetic diversity. Although range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change and aliens are likely to differ in many aspects, comparative studies are needed to determine the character and magnitude of differences between these two species categories.\n0i1k | Typically, range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change first colonize regions directly adjacent to the historic native range and may usually only colonize regions further away from the historic range as the expansion progresses. This progression is highly contingent on the maximum spread distance of individuals and the availability of suitable habitats. Range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change show denser, more aggregated distributions, reflecting colonization and this link between current distribution patterns and processes of distribution change can be used as indication for identifying range-expanding species. In contrast, if alien species are introduced to areas outside their native range but within the same continent, the foci of primary introductions are often not adjacent to the native range, because introductions depend on human agency that helps to overcome dispersal barriers. Subsequent spread across the suitable range is also contingent on the spread potential of the species, but secondary introductions may substantially increase spread.\ndqlg | Ecological novelty is a characteristic feature of species redistribution in the Anthropocene. Different facets of ecological novelty can be conceptualized, and we argue that these are associated in different ways with range-expanding and alien species. Specifically, ecological novelty can be inversely measured as ecoevolutionary experience of interacting resident and non-resident species: Organisms with novel weapons or other novel traits the resident species are not familiar with i.e., they have a low ecoevolutionary experience are expected to have stronger impacts than organisms that are similar to resident species i.e., high ecoevolutionary experience. We would expect that resident species typically have a higher ecoevolutionary experience when interacting with range-expanding species responding to human-induced environmental change than with alien species coming from\np6pq | Forum\n```",
