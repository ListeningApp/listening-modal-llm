        "content": "s8b5 | Rho sub one equals the integral over x of r script f sub one psi sub zero equals the integral over x of r bar psi sub one. More generally, this procedure can be extended by using the recursive formula two point twenty-five, which allows for the computation of response terms of arbitrary orders; this is used in particular to compute rho sub two, phys and rho sub two, extra when computing the value of alpha star defined in three point thirteen.\np450 | Approximation of the full response r sub alpha of eta. In this work, we compute the full response in order to quantify how much, and how quickly the response deviates from the linear regime. In actual applications, one typically does not compute the full response curve, in particular when using Monte Carlo simulations. The quantity of interest, namely the transport coefficient, comes from the linear response, which can be obtained from computing a single point (or typically two to ensure linearity), so computing the full response curve is not of interest.\nrsvo | The full response curve can be computed by solving the Fokker-Planck equation three point three, which we recall for convenience\nz4m8 | Four point three\nukf0 | Script L sub eta, alpha dagger psi sub eta, alpha equals zero, and then performing a quadrature on the integral\nk38m | r sub alpha of eta equals the integral over x of r psi sub eta, alpha. Solving the P D E. For the discretization of the P D Es four point one, four point two and four point three, we use a finite-difference scheme. Periodic boundary conditions are used in the spatial variable since we always consider q in T superscript d for both overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, with d equals one or d equals two. For overdamped Langevin dynamics, we use a centered finite-difference scheme. For the one-dimensional Langevin dynamics, the momentum\nnkj9 | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\n35a8 | variable is first truncated to negative Pmax, Pmax, then its domain is discretized with step size hp. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at p equals plus or minus Pmax. We ensured that our truncated value of the momentum Pmax equals six is large enough so that it does not affect the numerical results. A centered scheme is also used for Langevin dynamics, except for the transport term minus p M inverse q in the Fokker-Planck equation two point seventeen, where an upwind scheme is used (refer to Appendix B for the precise expressions of the aforementioned numerical schemes). All computations were performed with the Julia language.\n337o | Four point two. Overdamped Langevin dynamics - one-dimensional case. We present in this section the numerical results for the one-dimensional overdamped Langevin dynamics two point thirteen on X equals T, with potential energy\ncuth | Four point four V of q equals cosine two T q.\n09z2 | We consider the observable\n13fv | Four point five R of q equals open parenthesis a cosine two T q plus b sine two T q close parenthesis e B V of q,\nv5pj | where a, b in R. We choose this observable for two reasons. First, by construction, it has average zero with respect to the Gibbs probability measure, with density proportional to e to the negative B V. Second, we can tune the coefficients a and b to control the magnitude of the individual orders of response. This allows us to choose a and b such that the first and second-order responses are normalized, i.e. P one equals P two equals one, which makes it easier to compare the quality of each synthetic forcing.\ntrab | Due to the symmetries of the potential energy function four point four, we can directly compute the values of a and b such that p one equals P two equals one. More precisely, it can be shown that f one and f two are respectively odd and even on negative one-half, one-half so that b controls the magnitude of P one and a controls the magnitude of P two. The value of b such that p one equals one is easily computed using two point thirty-four to be\ngrxs | minus sine two T q f one of q d q four point six b equals Z inverse f one d a, Z equals e to the negative V d q. Similarly, the value of a such that P two equals one is negative one\nu9dn | Four point seven a equals Z inverse cosine two T q f two d q\nt25w | The spatial domain T equals zero, one is discretized into m equals two thousand points, with uniform step size h equals one over m. The simulations were performed with inverse temperature B equals one and mass M equals one, which is also the setting for the results in two dimensions obtained in Section four point three. Moreover, we consider the forcing F equals one, as this is the only nongradient forcing in dimension one on the torus.\nx62u | We present the full response curves and the associated linear response for each of the three synthetic forcings discussed in Section three point two point two. Figures three a, three b and three c correspond to the Feynman-Kac forcing three point nine, modified fluctuation-dissipation three point eight and divergence-free vector field three point five, respectively. Note that in dimension one, three point five reduces to a single option, namely\naoc8 | equals e v d. d a'\n3mdu | Four point eight\nm04v | which is the one used here. For each of the plots, we show the linear response, the full response curve r sub zero of eta for alpha equals zero, the response curve for r sub alpha star of eta for alpha star computed using three point thirteen, and response curves for some additional values of alpha in R for illustrative purposes. In some cases, in particular when the response curve associated with alpha star sees marginal improvement in extending the linear regime, we also compute the curve for alpha star of epsilon, where we choose epsilon equals zero point zero five. Lastly, Figure three d includes all synthetic forcings. Note that the maximal value of the forcing is much larger for Figure three d, where we compare the best choices for the magnitude of each synthetic forcing; this is also the setting for the illustrations presented in Sections four point three and four point four.",
