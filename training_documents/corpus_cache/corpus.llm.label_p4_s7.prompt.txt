You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Comparing the outcomes between anterior callosotomy and complete callosotomy (including a one or two stage complete callosotomy), ex- tent of disconnection did not significantly affect drop at- tack control (considering a 50% and an 80% cutoff, and using the chi-squared test). For "other seizure types," a complete callosotomy was significantly associated with a better outcome when compared to anterior callosotomy using the 50% cutoff <LATEX>\left( p = . 0 1 3 \right)</LATEX> but not using the 80% cutoff.
5esx | Outcomes of drop attack control following CC were compared to VNS outcomes according to degree of sei- zure reduction categories: < 50%, between 50% and 80%, and >80%. To verify that sufficient time had elapsed since placing VNS, we focused on patients with 1-2-year fol- low-up after VNS (prior to CC, <LATEX>\left. n = 2 7 \right) ,</LATEX> and patients with >2years follow-up after VNS (prior to CC, <LATEX>\left. n = 6 0 \right) .</LATEX> Using the Fisher exact test, the degree of drop attack reduction following CC was not significantly correlated to the degree of reduction after VNS <LATEX>\left( p = . 6 7 6 \right.</LATEX> for 1-2 years, and <LATEX>p = . 2 6 6</LATEX> for <LATEX>> 2 \quad y e a r s</LATEX> following the VNS before CC).
m5ka | In addition to the 10 cases undergoing completion of the posterior CC, 10 patients underwent additional sur- geries: frontal lobectomy <LATEX>\left( n = 1 \right) ,</LATEX> responsive neurostimu- lation system (RNS) concurrently with the completion of CC <LATEX>\left( n = 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and deep brain stimulation to the centrome- dian (CM) nucleus of the thalamus <LATEX>\left( n = 8 , \right.</LATEX> three of which had an RNS to the CM nucleus).
byu8 | 4 DISCUSSION -
76b0 | We report here that in children with LGS who fail to achieve seizure control after VNS, CC has an added value, significantly improving seizure control. This is true for drop (tonic and atonic) seizures and other seizure phenotypes. CC-related morbidity was low, and complete CC was asso- ciated with higher seizure reduction rates than partial CC.
zxz6 | Prior studies have reported the greater value of CC over VNS as a primary treatment for children with LGS,
xnth | especially for atonic seizures.499 However, other studies have found similar effectiveness for both treatments.5,9,10 Additionally, VNS seems more cost-effective 1 year after surgery and is associated with fewer complications.4,10,11 However, this study did not evaluate long-term cost-effec- tiveness (considering the need for VNS battery replace- ment), which may prove CC is more cost-effective. When both options (CC and VNS) are available, many families will opt for VNS first.7 Reasons include avoidance of brain surgery, especially because the treatment is pallia- tive and not curative. This is based mainly on the fear of callosotomy-associated risks, including vascular injury, supplementary motor area syndrome, akinetic mutism, disconnection syndrome, and other risks (infection, hy- drocephalus, wound-related, and others).
vafm | Data are limited regarding secondary treatments (CC following VNS or VNS following CC). Hong et al. reported that half of the patients who underwent CC following VNS reported >50% seizure reduction, with seven of nine patients experiencing total elimination of drop seizures.12 Guillamon et al.13 reported a small case series of three patients treated with CC following VNS in severe drug-resistant epilepsy. They reported up to 98% decrease in total seizure frequency following CC. In another small series of seven cases, Arya et al.14 reported all patients were free of drop attacks, with a 34.7% decrease in total daily seizure frequency at a mean follow-up of 2.6 years. The results of the current series concur with these publications, with approximately 80% having >50% reduction in drop attacks, and 60% having >50% reduction in other seizure types.
2zmw | Katagiri et al.15 evaluated 10 children who underwent VNS following failed CC, the reverse of our approach. Six of 10 (60%) patients had ≥50% seizure reduction for all residual seizure types after VNS, and 77.8% showed total resolution of drop seizures.
bf9k | CC may be performed via various approaches, includ- ing interhemispheric, endoscopic-assisted (also done via the interhemispheric route), and LITT. 16-18 LITT approach is minimally invasive, associated with shorter hospitaliza- tion and fewer complications, and has similar outcomes to the open approaches.19 However, LITT is not widely avail- able, and may not be suitable for all corpus callosal anat- omy. Open CC, on the other hand, is a widely performed surgery. The microsurgical technique is common to other commonly performed procedures, and is associated with low morbidity if done by experienced surgeons.
otkr | There is a long-lasting debate regarding the optimal extent of callosotomy between anterior, complete, and posterior callosotomy.4,20-22- The basis for this debate is the potential for disconnection syndrome.23 However, most children with LGS have profound intellectual disability at baseline, and the balance between seizure control (with

9mrz | its positive impact on the quality of life) and the risk of potential disconnection syndrome often favor the goal of seizure control.
pk06 | This study aim was not to compare CC to VNS as a primary treatment, but to show that VNS failure does not predict the failure of CC, and that CC as the secondary treatment can have a significant benefit.
7wn9 | Interestingly, the outcomes of our series (of secondary CC) concur with the results of primary CC.4,6 The reasons for the VNS-CC dissonance and added value of CC are un- known but likely involve their different mechanisms of action. Cukiert et al. noted a postsurgical disruption of sec- ondary bilateral synchrony seen on electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in 85% of CC patients, with no EEG modi- fication after VNS insertion.7 CC disrupts the bilateral syn- chrony of the hemispheres, whereas the exact mechanisms of VNS are not entirely understood. Based on animal mod- els, it has multiple possible mechanisms of actions, among which is a suppression of cortical hypersynchronization by modulating the synaptic network.24,25 Other recent data suggest that VNS affects neural networks in three domains: brainstem, limbic system, and cortex.20 The importance of frequency and amplitude of stimulation on the VNS effect was stated as well. Nevertheless, it should be noted that over time, shorter epilepsy duration and longer VNS therapy time indicted a higher response likelihood, rather than dos- ing setting.27 The direct disconnection (achieved with a CC) shows immediate and more effective results. This network disruption not only reduces the general activity associated with drop attacks, but it also reduces other seizures through as yet unknown mechanisms.
wcd0 | This study has several limitations, mainly its retro- spective multicenter nature, as well as the lack of a stan- dardized evaluation time point. The lack of a unified time point for outcome evaluation may bias the results. As each center reported data, we could not centrally verify the data, nor verify whether LGS-like cases were included. Detailed neurocognitive assessment was not possible. Disconnection syndrome could not be con- firmed in our patients. We did not include EEG data before or following surgery. Thus, the diagnosis of LGS and the effect of surgery on EEG could not be centrally verified. The epilepsy status was based on parental re- ports during follow-up visits, and the information was incomplete for some patients. The accuracy of seizure detection by parental notification is limited, especially among children, and a possible bias to report better re- sults following surgery cannot be excluded.28 Reports on seizure outcomes, as well as on the number of ASMs, were not complete. Thus, a bias toward better seizure control cannot be excluded. We did not include dosages of ASM or change to different drugs, possibly affecting seizure outcome. Some of the patients had a VNS battery

pn9j | change after CC, perhaps contributing to better seizure control, mood, and overall quality of life. We did not col- lect data regarding the need for VNS battery change, or avoidance of replacement when it was needed.
1pmc | Despite these limitations, these children were treated for several years with various ASMs. Parents were aware of the seizure semiology; thus, although potentially in- accurate, their report of seizure reduction most likely re- flects an actual decline.
5z6q | 5 CONCLUSIONS |
yeoh | CC has a significant added value in controlling seizures in children with LGS who had prior VNS. Callosotomy re- sulted in better seizure control considering <LATEX>a > 5 0</LATEX> cutoff for drop attacks and other seizure types. CC was associ- ated with a low complication rate. Complete callosotomy resulted in better seizure control compared to anterior cal- losotomy considering <LATEX>a > 5 0</LATEX> cutoff for other seizure types.
