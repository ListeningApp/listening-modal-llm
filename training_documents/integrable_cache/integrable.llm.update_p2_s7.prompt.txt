You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

yeoh | On the basis of standard kinetic arguments, <LATEX>J _ { N }</LATEX> is ex- pected to be a function of a single compound variable, the effective length <LATEX>\xi = L / \ell</LATEX> expressed in units of the mean free path <LATEX>\ell</LATEX> of the quasi particles,
b8hf | <LATEX>J _ { N } \left( L , \varepsilon \right) = j _ { N } \left( L / \ell \right) .</LATEX> (3)
hntf | For <LATEX>\xi \gg 1 ,</LATEX> we expect <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( \xi \right) \propto 1 / \xi ,</LATEX> meaning that the flux is the result of a standard diffusive process, while <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( 0 \right)</LATEX> is a finite value, meaning that the process is ballistic for system sizes smaller than the mean free path <LATEX>\left( \xi \ll 1 \right) .</LATEX> <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( \xi \right)</LATEX> dependence is captured by the simple effective formula
99fo | <LATEX>j _ { N } \left( \xi \right) = \frac { j _ { 0 } } { r + \xi }</LATEX> (4)
y5r7 | where <LATEX>r</LATEX> is a constant accounting for the boundary resis- tance [43] and <LATEX>j _ { 0 }</LATEX> is a suitable additional constant.
lrry | The vicinity to the integrable limit manifests itself as a divergence of the mean free path, which we account for by assuming <LATEX>\ell \approx \varepsilon ^ { - \theta } ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\theta > 0</LATEX> is a system-dependent
hvhm | exponent. As long as <LATEX>J _ { A } \left( L , \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> does not display any singu- larity for <LATEX>\varepsilon \rightarrow 0</LATEX> (we return to this point in the final part of the Letter), we can neglect its dependence <LATEX>\mathrm { o n } \varepsilon \left( \mathrm { f o r } \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\varepsilon \ll 1</LATEX> 1). Therefore, for large <LATEX>L ,</LATEX> Eq. (2) can be rewritten as
863b | <LATEX>J \left( L , \varepsilon \right) \approx \frac { c _ { N } } { L \varepsilon ^ { \theta } } + \frac { c _ { A } } { L ^ { 1 - \eta } } ,</LATEX> , (5)
fj24 | where CN and <LATEX>c _ { A }</LATEX> are two suitable parameters. Accord- ingly, the anomalous contribution prevails only above the crossover length <LATEX>\ell _ { c } \approx \varepsilon ^ { - \theta / \eta } .</LATEX> For <LATEX>L \leq \ell _ { c } ,</LATEX> heat conduc- tion is dominated by the <LATEX>j _ { N } .</LATEX> In particular, within the range <LATEX>\left[ \ell = \varepsilon ^ { - \theta } , \ell _ { c } \right]</LATEX> an apparent normal conductivity is expected, which is nothing but a finite size effect.
uz3c | Now, we start the numerical analysis, focusing on mod- els of the class (1). More specifically, we shall consider the chain [47, 48] with inter-
d5bi | <LATEX>U _ { T } \left( y \right) = \left( e ^ { - y } + y - 1 \right) .</LATEX> The HPG dynamics consists of successive tween neighboring particles according to the kinematic rules
ba4l | <LATEX>u _ { i } ^ { \prime } = \frac { m _ { i } - m _ { i + 1 } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i } + \frac { 2 m _ { i + 1 } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i + 1 } \quad ,</LATEX> <LATEX>u _ { i + 1 } ^ { \prime } = \frac { 2 m _ { i } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i } - \frac { m _ { i } - m _ { i + 1 } } { m _ { i } + m _ { i + 1 } } u _ { i + 1 } ,</LATEX> (6)
ffx8 | where <LATEX>u _ { n } = \dot { q } _ { n }</LATEX> and the primed variables denote the values after the collision. Simulations are very efficient since they only require keeping track of the collisions [46].
s6su | For equal masses <LATEX>\left( m _ { n } = m \right) ,</LATEX> both models are com- pletely integrable: in the HPG, the constants of motion are the initial velocities, while in the Toda model the conserved actions are given functions of positions and momenta [49, 50]. Both models can be seen as gases of quasi-particles: velocitons for HPG [51] and solitons for Toda [47]. Transport is ballistic: <LATEX>\kappa \left( L \right)</LATEX> is proportional to <LATEX>L</LATEX> and the energy-current correlation function does not decay to zero at large times [52, 53]. Note that, accord- ing to the classification of Ref. [54], the two models are noninteracting and interacting, respectively.
