You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

l2v9 | $30 000 (varying between $40 000 for B & E and $20 000 in for Mike's; see Table 3). Not surprisingly, these higher values are gener- ated among those who bought their lots a longer time ago: those buying their lots be- fore 1989 valued their property at $35 000, whilst those purchasing since 1995 valued at less than half that amount-at $14 500.13 Al- though these data are hypothetical self-as- sessments and are, perhaps, somewhat inflated coming out as they do at an overall average of $30 000, we believe that they are probably quite close to reflecting the cumu- lative costs of land purchase and housing improvements that many people have made, in particular those related to building or plac- ing a dwelling on the lot.14
afbe | However, as we have underscored, esti- mating the current value or worth of one's property and actually getting that on the open market are very different matters. In Starr County colonias today, it is even more difficult to sell a lot with a dwelling on it than it is to traspasar a vacant lot. The reasons for this are actually quite obvious: there are very few potential buyers who would be willing or able to pay such a (rela- tively) high price on the open market. Thus, there is no effective demand, but assuming that such a sale could be realised-either now or in the future-then colonia popula- tions would be moving from being equity- poor, to a position of being able to make a relatively sizeable net gain. Currently, how- ever, given the real difficulty in realising those gains, and as long as the land market is 'stunted' with little or no effective demand for purchase at the $30 000-40 000 level, we are obliged to conclude that for colonia resi- dents today it is the use value rather than exchange value that remains paramount. For many colonia residents this is not a problem, unless they are motivated or obliged to sell. But theoretically it is important insofar as low-income minority populations (in this case Hispanics) are less likely to be success- ful in building real wealth than better-off Whites, accentuating social stratification and segmentation akin to the arguments of William Julius Wilson (1999). Investing in
78r8 | low-income real estate is not a particularly good investment deal for the very low-in- come segment of the market-a point that confirms the finding of a broader colonias study in Texas (Ward et al., 2000, p. 112). Nevertheless, one must also recognise that it is probably the only arena in which low-in- come people in Starr County can invest and hope to gain from their 'sweat' equity.
320g | Conclusions: Comparing Informal Hous- ing Market Operations in the US and Else- where
tp8g | This paper has argued that, for Texas colo- nias and low-income sub-divisions, the rate at which land is valorised is relatively mod- est and that the provision of formal property titles as part of a policy to 'regularise' clouded land titles appears to have little or no direct influence upon market performance or upon land prices. Instead, it is sweat equity by the people themselves, along with housing improvement, that raises the property value and which gives rise to some equity creation and to (rather modest) potential wealth cre- ation. But in Texas and elsewhere in the US, an overarching problem remains: namely, the low viability of the property (sales) market, such that unless the market is 'primed' to allow for greater mobility and sales, then there is little prospect that low-income (colo- nia) residents will be able to benefit financially from home-ownership, and cer- tainly not to anything like the same extent experienced by middle- and upper-income groups. Despite these modest gains and eq- uity growth through land acquisition and par- ticipation in colonia housing markets, the higher gains accruing to the formal middle and higher ends of the property market are leading to greater, not lesser, social segmen- tation between those income-groups and the poor. We recognise that the 'bootstraps' ap- proach and the self-managed opportunities for home-ownership in colonias and similar sub-divisions in the US do offer important positive outcomes as place of residence as well as providing a mechanism for saving and for creating equity. This is particularly
gxfd | true if one compares peri-urban colonia own- ers with their equity-poor renter and inner- city peers. But there also seems little doubt that the formal land and property markets are much more favourable to middle-income America, for whom homesteading generates better medium- and long-term growth in eq- uity.
s2v1 | In this article, we have observed that infor- mal colonia land markets function poorly and that there is evidence for only very mod- est increases in real land values from one decade to the next. In essence, real land values appear to be 'flat' over time. Nor does intervention to provide clear title to lot own- ers appear to make much difference, al- though it is arguably still too soon to use the data to hand to gauge accurately the impact of CRG's intervention in the colonias outside Rio Grande City. When it comes to informal colonia property markets, the level of servic- ing provision and relative location are not good explanatory variables of land price dif- ferentials either. Instead, our data suggest that it is the price-setting behaviour by land developers and supply-side variables that best explain land prices and land price changes over time. This is an important finding and suggests that more orthodox ex- planations and theory about land pricing do not work well at the lower and informal end of the market, raising caveats about the ver- acity of de Soto-type arguments of land mar- ket behaviour and regularisation. 'Social' explanations of price setting such as those outlined here corroborate findings elsewhere (Jones et al., 1993; Varley, 2002) and further emphasise the functionality of informality in providing access to land for low-income self- build or self-managed housing. In addition to these 'social' variables, lot affordability to the very poor is achieved through the nature of supply by three principal mechanisms: first, by offering poor-quality land without services; secondly, by lowering front-end transaction costs through informal vendor financing and through informal contractual arrangements; and, thirdly, by reducing the size of lots to a bare minimum such that the overall lot price is just within the reach of
jkp9 | very low-income buyers. Average colonia lot prices in Rio Grande City and Starr County are generally lower than in many other bor- der counties, but the unit price per square foot is about the same, the lower prices in Rio Grande City coming through smaller lot size.
