You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

xd3m | Assessing the female figure identification technique's reliability as a body shape classification system
8qb6 | This paper demonstrates the effects of slight differences in measurement definitions on resultant body shape classification. Ergonomic researchers consider the Female Figure Identification Technique (FFIT) a 'gold standard' body shape classification system to describe variation in a population's 3 D profile. Nevertheless, researchers use FFIT without a scientific basis or consider- ing their ergonomic suitability. This paper rigorously evaluates FFIT, focussing on ergonomics, garment construction, and scientific research applications. Through analysing 1,679 3 D Body Scans, we assess the level of agreement between the FFIT's body shape classification when measurements placed following FFIT's or SizeUK's guidance. We establish how different interpre- tations of FFIT's measurement placement cause the same body to be categorised into different shapes - in up to 40% of cases. FFIT omits shoulder measurements that have little relationship to body shape yet are vital in garment construction. Using FFIT with different datasets and defi- nitions, therefore, leads to inconsistent conclusions about shape differences.

ftfg | Introduction
7xi5 | Despite garment construction practices ignoring cur- rent body shape classifications (Faust 2014), body shape underpins how ergonomists, practitioners, and researchers understand the human form. An increasing number of clothing ergonomics academics are embracing the Female Figure Identification Technique (FFIT) developed by Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b). In using the FFIT, clothing ergonomics academics assume its suitability for scientific research,
w8r5 | including nationality-based body shape comparisons (Yim Lee et al. 2007; Robinet 2009), body shape based health estimations (Sarakon et al. 2017; 2016), and consumer's perceptions of their body's shape (Ridgway, Parsons, and Sohn 2017; Zhang et al. 2017). Body shape is also essential for online fashion retail's virtual fit/garment size prediction tools (Januszkiewicz et al. 2017). For these scientific and retail applications to be reliable, their underpinning body shape classifi- cation system must be indisputable. An indisputable
ybik | system is when assessment categorises a person into the same shape every time. Consistent categorisation requires dependable definition with a system like FFIT, something which is problematic when the system and its definition need careful analysis to understand.
gii5 | Given FFIT's prevalence and influence within body shape research for apparel, researchers may assume Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan (2004a, 2004b) devel- oped a system that consistently defines body shape. The FFIT, developed using a TC2 body scanner, uses six girth measurements - bust, waist, hip, high-hip, stomach, and abdomen - which is an advance on more traditional 2 D width-based classifications. Width- based analysis was necessary in the FFIT development because of limitations of knowledge, but they made a clear advancement in circumferential definitions – relating shape more clearly to clothing; The FFIT then defines nine body shapes among American women (hourglass, bottom hourglass, top hourglass, spoon, rect- angle, diamond, oval, triangle, and inverted triangle; see Figure 1) which is again an advance on traditional sys- tems. The mathematical descriptors of body shapes that the FFIT proposed were based on logic: devel- oped from literature, experts' tacit knowledge in apparel design, and visual analysis of the segmental proportions in the female body's bust-to-hips zone - excluding the shoulder-to-bust zone. However, the FFIT only provides general guidelines on how a practi- tioner should take its six measurements. The practi- tioner also needs familiarity with the TC2 scanner because FFIT is grounded in the TC2 scanner's soft- ware definitions. Furthermore, practitioners need care- ful reading of FFIT's supporting texts to ensure consistency of measurements used. Those reporting on using FFIT apply common names for
q5eu | measurements with multiple definitions (e.g. waist), potentially leading to significantly different measure- ments (Gill et al. 2014) and then different shapes.
a7ao | Careful analysis of FFIT shows it uses measurement definitions different from those used in significant European body scanning surveys, particularly the United Kingdom (UK) National Sizing Survey: SizeUK (2002). The SizeUK survey is the UK's first national sur- vey of the population since the 1950s, capturing three-dimensional (3 D) shapes of the population, using the same 3D body scanners (TC2) as FFIT instead of tape measures. SizeUK's goal was to sup- port UK retailers to amend their size charts and pro- vide a data source for scientific research, including medical, health, transport, and product design. SizeUK provides a database of anthropometric measurements for industry's use, and it not a body shape classifica- tion system. Nevertheless, Size UK influences how industry understands human measurements and their placements. Ergonomists and researchers may com- bine SizeUK's measurement definitions with the FFIT's body classification process. Combining measurement definitions is clear in Yim Lee et al.'s (2007) work, showing brief consideration is given to consistency of measurement definition or capture device.
29a3 | The FFIT defines the hip in TC2 software as the larg- est circumference in the crotch-to-waist region (Table 1). Size UK, in contrast, uses the buttock prom- inence (Seat) to define the hip. Both the FFIT and Size UK, however, use the nomenclature hip to classify their measurement. This highlights the complexities of using scanning technologies and varied measurement definitions, complicated further as some standards related to scanning ISO 20685 (ISO 2010a). The ISO Standards - 7250 (ISO 2010b) and 8559-1 (ISO 2017)
sb1e | - provide foundational support for research compar- ing measurements. Nevertheless, ISO 7250 does not have a hip circumference definition. Without a hip cir- cumference definition, ISO 7250 has little applicability to the FFIT, and this paper, as the FFIT relies upon the hip.
w2yn | While the FFIT and SizeUK use a 3 D Body scanning system by TC2 (TC2 2011), the lack of standardisation in methods meant three vital measurements were incompatible at the hip-girth, the waist, and the seat. Without standardisation of definition, the same tool leads to a practitioner taking a different measurement placement than the FFIT intended. SizeUK, however, uses TC2's seat measurement for its hip (see Table 1). TC2's seat measurement corresponds to the Hip defin- ition of International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO) 8559-1 (2017): the body's horizontal girth
ap6l | measured at the hip - the greatest projection at the body's back (buttocks or seat); see Figure 2.
iest | The FFIT's waist measurement is set as Small of the Back (SOB) +6.35 cm (FFIT), while SizeUK situates the waist as SOB +4.0 cm (SizeUK). These slight differences are problematic as the narrowing of the female form towards the rib cage can locate a much smaller cir- cumference outside where a practitioner may desig- nate the waist region. Altering hip and waist measurement placement significantly changes the measurements' size (Gill and Parker 2017). Suppose a practitioner uses alternative definitions of measure- ments within an FFIT body classification exercise. In that case, the impact of different measurement place- ment on body shape classification is uncertain, yet potentially damaging to the FFIT's between-studies comparisons.
