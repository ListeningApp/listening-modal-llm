You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

j623 | Tableau Public Interface Features
d7ly | Visual cues
plf9 | Within the Data pane, each field name is displayed, but there is also a visual cue that tells you what type of field it is. Field types determine the function and capability of joining data sources. In addition to showing the field type, Tableau Public allows you to change a field's type by right-clicking on it and selecting the Change Data Type option. The following list shows the fields and their descriptions:
vk11 | . The Abc field: This indicates that the field is a string field, which means that the contents of the field may include letters, special characters, or numbers
jj0l | · The calendar icon: This indicates a date, datetime, or time field
qdqt | . The # sign: This indicates a numeric field that can have any type of native numeric format, from bigint to decimal
6h7m | · The globe icon: This icon indicates that the field has geographic attributes
b6vb | . The paper clip icon: This indicates that the field is a group that you have created in Tableau Public
c5h2 | · The Venn diagram icon: This indicates a set
eccu | The parameters have their own data types, which can be established when you create them.
rtpq | The Analytics pane
po9y | The Analytics pane is next to the Data pane. You can access it by clicking on its header. It provides you with the ability to add summaries, average lines, constant lines, distribution bands, medians, boxplots, forecasts, and other visual analytics to your visualization. You can then customize and edit them by using the reference line and formatting user interfaces.
w5lk | The Analytics that you can add are dependent on the data elements in your visualization, which include the following:
pb48 | Summarized Analytics: This includes the following elements:
nriw | ° A constant line: This is an integer on an axis that you can input
h7kb | ° An average line: This displays the mean of the measure that you have selected either across the table, pane, or cell
2mrs | ° Median line with 25% and 75% quartiles: This creates a median reference line and a quartile distribution band that you can edit
f7it | Chapter 2
o9jm | · Modeling: This includes the following elements:
gz4c | ° Average (or mean) with confidence intervals
u30w | ° Trend lines with the most commonly used models (such as linear, exponential, and so on)
ee2o | . Custom: With the help of this element, you can add custom reference lines and distribution bands as well as box plots, which can also be used by right-clicking on an axis
p87c | In the following screenshot, we added the average delay in minutes per day to the graph as a reference line by performing the following operations:
reyp | 1. Click on Analytics to see the Analytics pane.
9vu6 | 2. Drag Average Line to the y axis, which is the vertical axis.

e6pm | . Dashboard: This is used to create and format dashboards as well as to add actions.
ml6c | . Story: This is used to add Story Points, which enhance the narrative capabilities of a data visualization. Story Points refers to a specific function in Tableau Public, and it's beyond the scope of this book.
ujdt | · Analysis: This can be used to aggregate and disaggregate measures, create forecasts, totals, and trend lines, and create and edit calculated fields.
umn7 | . Map: By changing the Map options, you can modify background maps and images, and add custom geocoding and WMS.
t2yx | . Format: This is used to modify the appearance of visualizations.
70qq | . Window: This can be used to switch between the presentation and development mode as well as other views in the workbook
2421 | . Help: You can use this to get help and manage performance.
lvcg | The buttons on the toolbar are graphically descriptive of their function. When you roll over each with your mouse, the instructions for use pop up as well.
f9cy | The buttons of the toolbar include the following:
3vhx | . The Start button: This takes you back to the Start screen
1lk7 | . The Undo button: This reverses the previous action that you took and can go as far as back to the state of the workbook when you opened it
rkgd | . The Redo button: This repeats actions that you have reversed
jbj0 | . The Save button: This is critical, as Tableau Public does not auto-save

otfh | · Highlight: This allows users to click on dimension members and highlight the related records in other visualizations on the dashboard
6dzi | . The Presentation mode: This hides the menus, the Data pane, or the Dashboard pane
nk46 | Canvas and Column/Row shelves
sbg4 | Tableau Software has a user interface that is very different from that of the older reporting or data analysis tools that you may have used at work or in school. It uses a methodology of dragging and dropping objects for most of the functions that you need to perform to build a visualization. The areas of the workspace where you place objects are called Shelves and Cards. Many of the tasks in this book instruct you to drag a field to the Columns or Rows shelf.
0vsm | The far right side of the screen is called the canvas area. It is where sheet objects, such as a chart, are built. The chart area itself starts out blank, and you must drag the fields that you want to analyze to an axis, header, or the Columns or Rows shelf, which also determines on which axis or header the field appears.
rrsc | Tableau Public Interface Features
xjfg | In the following screenshot, we have highlighted the Columns and Rows shelves, the canvas, the Marks card, the Filters shelf, and the Pages shelf. This screenshot shows how the workspace looks before we add fields to it, and the description is as follows:
iw9o | . The Columns Shelf (1) is where you put fields that you want on the horizontal header or the x axis, that is, the axis that goes from left to right. The Rows shelf is where you put fields that you want on the y axis.
enxg | . The Canvas (2) has three places where you can drop fields, namely the x axis/header, the y axis/header, and the visualization space itself.
