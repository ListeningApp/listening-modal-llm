You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

fax0 | Although municipalities in the United States are not allowed to issue their own currency, they can nonetheless aid privately run systems. First, they can provide funding. In Toulouse, France, the city is the primary funder for the local currency SOL-Violette (OuiShare TV, 2013). The city gave the project 120,000 euros for startup, and in the first year of operation, the currency grew to 1,000 users and 95 participating businesses and became a model for communities across Europe (Paracchini, 2012). In England, local governments have also provided funding ("Brixton People," 2013; Seyfang, 2002). While cities may not have their own funding for currency project, they may be able to leverage support from other sources. The City of Montpelier, VT, used grant money from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (n.d.) to help create the REACH Time Bank.
60ky | The second way in which local governments can aid local currency is by accepting it for payment of taxes, fees, and services. As noted earlier, the U.S. Constitution prohibits states from doing so (U.S. Const. art. I, §10), but this does not extend to municipalities. Accepting fees and taxes in a currency creates a demand for the currency and drives local production and consumption (Hallsmith & Lietaer, 2011). In the city of Bristol, England, strong support from the city council propelled the Bristol Pound to success. In its first year, it recruited over 600 businesses and issued over £250,000 of currency and now the city council accepts it for payment of taxes, fees, and services ("Council will take tax payments," 2013; Harvey, 2012). Similarly, the London district of Brixton council accepts their local currency for payment of business taxes and offers to pay portions of their employees' salaries with it (Shakhli, 2013). In the United States, a smaller scale example occurred when the public transit system in Ithaca agreed to accept up to $5 worth of Ithaca HOURS as payment toward a monthly bus pass ("Ithaca HOURS Accepted," 2009).

hm8k | State governments can also play a role. Those that prohibit complementary currencies (Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Virginia) could revise their statutes to allow local or social purpose currency systems to operate. Indeed, the State of California recently did just that by repealing a section of their Corporations Code that prohibited the issuance or circulation of complementary currencies (2014 Cal. Stat. 1951). The bill passed with wide support: 28 to 12 in the Senate and 52 to 27 in the Assembly ("AB-129 Lawful Money", 2014).
5tlv | Though states cannot accept local currencies for payment of taxes or debt (U.S. Const. art. I, §10) unless there is federal legislation (U.S. v. Rifen, 1978), there are other means of support they can provide. They can educate the public about local currencies, hold trainings for potential currency managers, publicize existing local currencies and administer currency accreditation services. Without violating federal law, states can create their own time banks. For example, Vocational Rehabilitation and Unemployment Offices could run time banks to help clients develop skills or Parks and Wildlife Departments could develop innovative uses of time banks to encourage volunteerism and facility use.
ctln | The state of Vermont has passed legislation (Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 11, §§ 921-938) that gives the state and local governments influence in the creation of local currency without actually issuing it. The statute provides for the formation of "scrip corporations" for the sole purpose of issuing complementary currency (Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 11, § 921). If the scrip corporations issue currency backed by deposits in a Vermont bank, they can operate without government involvement in the creation of currency. However, the amount of currency that can be issued cannot exceed 1/3 of the principal on deposit. Compared to the BerkShares currency which is issued at a rate of 105% of the cash deposits (New Economy Coalition, 2013), this is quite
feis | LOCAL CURRENCY: POLICY BARRIERS AND SUPPORT
ignx | restrictive. However, the statute also allows for the issuance of "scrip" based on "short term notes and obligations of towns, cities or other municipalities" (Vt. Stat. Ann., tit. 11, § 926). In effect, this allows local currency to be created by local governments in the same way the United States government creates dollars by issuing treasury bonds to the Federal Reserve Bank (Wray, 1998). By working with a scrip corporation, the state or a city could, in essence, borrow local currency into existence. While this is an important model for local governments wishing to be involved in the creation and circulation of local currency, in reality it does not appear to be currently utilized. A search of the Vermont Secretary of State corporate database (Vermont Secretary of State, n.d.) revealed no existing scrip corporations.
4voz | Federal Policy Supports
ekp7 | Federal policy change could have a tremendous effect on local currencies. As indicated by the Supreme Court, Congress can pass legislation to allow local governments to issue their own community currency and allow states to accept local currency as payment of taxes and other debt (The Mayor v. Ray, 1873; U.S. v. Rifen, 1978). Either one of these actions would create an entirely new and supportive policy environment in which participation in local currencies is fostered.
vkmi | Other federal changes could assist with currency administration. Local proxy and fiat currencies could gain flexibility if the ban on currency denominations of less than one dollar was repealed. Exemptions for local social purpose currency organizations to money transmission and securities regulations could ease administrative burdens for LETS. These regulations were not crafted for the unique circumstances of local currency, but were intended to prevent money laundering and protect investors (Bank Secrecy Act of 1970; Securities Act of 1933). Another administrative obstacle for LETS could be removed if legislation were passed to allow 1099-Bs

a86p | for individuals to be issued on an annual basis rather than at the time of each transaction. Another important consideration is to ensure Congress minimizes unintended adverse effects on local currencies when it creates future legislation to regulate large commercial virtual currencies like BitCoin.
n8dg | Conclusion
devf | By providing economic opportunities, stimulating the local economy, and encouraging social connections, local currencies can assist communities meet their goals and support their unique values. Local currencies across the globe support socially and ecologically responsible businesses, the arts, education, and economic development, and address the needs of vulnerable populations. They are an innovative people-centered tool for community development which can succeed even when the national currency is scarce. However, challenges emerge from their policy environment which threaten their full success.
z7gp | To address policy barriers to local currency, community leaders and organizations can engage in policy advocacy on a variety of levels. As the State of California has shown, efforts to repeal state prohibitions can be successful. Citizens of Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Virginia can request their representatives to sponsor and support bills to repeal the restrictive laws. Similar advocacy can be done at the federal level where legislators can be encouraged to repeal the ban on currencies of less than one dollar, provide exemptions for local currency systems in the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and Securities Act of 1933, and revise the reporting requirements for barter exchanges.
g8ms | Policy change is not without risk. Because local currency research is still in an early stage, communities cannot ensure the currencies will bring the social and economic gains suggested by theory. To deal with this uncertainty, policies can be piloted on the state and local
