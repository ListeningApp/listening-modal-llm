You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

lhkq | very low-income buyers. Average colonia lot prices in Rio Grande City and Starr County are generally lower than in many other bor- der counties, but the unit price per square foot is about the same, the lower prices in Rio Grande City coming through smaller lot size.
82ju | While there is substantial evidence that colonias offer an important medium for cre- ating home equity, this is achieved primarily through improving the land by engaging in self-help house construction or, as is more usual in Texas sub-divisions, by placing a manufactured home on the lot, perhaps with self-help extensions. However, the ability to realise this property investment through sale in the market-place (i.e. mobilising the 'ex- change value' of the property) is severely limited by the lack of demand. This is be- cause other poor people cannot afford to buy properties at this lower end of the market, where, as we have observed, homes average $30 000 or more. Unless financing mecha- nisms are put in place to facilitate home sales, there is little prospect that low-income populations will be able to find buyers that will allow them to cash-in on their sweat equity investments.
y2qo | These findings run in the same direction as recent work in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. Title regularisation per se appears to have little impact upon land prices or, for that matter, upon the upgrading pro- cess, although it may have broader significance in those situations-such as in Texas-where the tradition of formal and full property title is strongly engrained. Else- where (Ward et al., 2003, 2005) we have analysed what land title means for residents in the same study settlements examined in this article and we show how the clearing of titles by the CRG was indeed important for these colonia populations in Rio Grande City, particularly in so far as it gave house- holders greater self-esteem and assertiveness in dealing with the local authorities, and in empowering their political participation. However, receiving full title from the CRG appears to have made little difference in the extent and rate at which households made
1piq | home improvements; nor does it enhance uity and self-help dwelling consolidation ef- their propensity to use the homes as col- lateral against leveraging credit. Low-income Mexican-origin populations in Texas, like their counterparts in Mexico, are extremely cautious about taking on debt that might endanger losing their homes (Varley, 2002; Ward et al., 2005).
7fqw | Previous research in Mexico and else- where has demonstrated that determinants other than title are invariably more important in shaping people's sense of security of occu- pancy in irregular settlements (Varley, 1985; de Souza, 2001; Ward, 2003a). Such deter- minants include the size (weight of numbers) of the settlement, its age, the level of services already installed and the political contacts of local leaders. In Rio Grande City, however, these determinants did not apply for a num- ber of important reasons: the settlement size is much smaller; there is the generalised context and expectancy of full legality of property tiles in Texas and the US; and, city or county governments are largely unrespon- sive to informal settlements (for different reasons). These three factors combined to generate a sense of vulnerability among resi- dents, such that those without clean title wel- comed the CRG's intervention. The point to underscore is that the significance of gaining title did not translate into an enhanced func- tioning of the land market, nor did it translate into a quickening of dwelling improvements or a newfound opportunity to leverage credit against property titles (see Ward et al., 2005).
rhaz | An important difference between Texas colonias and their irregular settlement coun- terparts in Mexico and elsewhere is that in less developed countries the processes of illegal land capture and self-build housing and mutual aid community programmes gen- erally have a much greater impact upon over- all land valorisation (i.e. increasing property values and growth of equity). This is largely because the initial costs of land acquisition are non-existent or very low and because state intervention to provide services offers significant 'windfall' gains to low-income households that complement their sweat eq-

wtfz | forts. In these contexts, the (informal) market works quite well-at least, it does in the earlier phases of irregular settlement devel- opment-and it is common to find lots 'for sale' in the incipient stages of settlement and dwelling improvement. However, as in Texas colonias, homesteaders confront a rising lack of demand, once the settlement is established and 'consolidating', and there appears to be relatively little outward mobility by first-gen- eration homesteaders. Fortunately for them, most owner households in Mexico and else- where do not wish to move and it is the 'use' value of the lot as a place to live and raise a family that is more important than the ex- change value. But those that do need to move out will be hard-pressed to find a buyer, since the increased value of their (now) consoli- dated properties places the total cost beyond most of the effective demand. Thus property prices are depressed and/or transactions will move back into informal exchanges creating potential further downstream title 'irregulari- ties'.
qy1i | Other researchers who are also sceptical of de Soto's views about the merits of title and its benefits in bringing people into the formal market-place have shown that immobility is the rule, not the exception, and that the effec- tive demand is extremely limited (Gilbert, 2002; Varley, 2002). In Mexico, for exam- ple, only those former irregular settlements that are particularly favoured in their location are likely to attract buy-outs from better-off working-class or lower-middle-income resi- dents. Similarly, prime lots such as those on block corners or along main streets may be attractive to commercial establishments and here the full lot value may be realised. But, for most first-generation homesteaders, a dwelling is for life (Gilbert, 2002), and the lot and home are likely to be recast and remodelled to take account of second- and third-generation households or kinsmen sharing the lot or dwelling space. Texas colo- nias are similarly disadvantaged for the same reasons-a lack of effective demand-al- though to date, at least, there is little or no discernable densification even though this

uodj | will almost certainly occur as future genera- tions grow to adulthood (Ward, 1999).
k16v | Thus, at the meso-level analysis of colonia land markets in Texas that has been our focus in this paper, there is not much cause for optimism or for any indication that land titling is likely to have a significant impact in improving the operation of the (now) formal land market. Provision of legal title does not appear to unlock the 'mysteries' and benefits of capital and offer participation to the poor in colonia land markets. Supply-side policies related to regularisation and clearing of 'clouded' lot title will have little or no effect without broader initiatives to enhance effec- tive demand. And even though policies to install essential services and to provide greater opportunities for purchaser financing are urgently required and will undoubtedly help, real effective demand is not likely to change without improved incomes and local economic opportunities. Researchers in Texas and elsewhere are unlikely to find much 'mystery' in that.

ti7f | to different base-level years-1983 in the survey, and 2002 in CRG database analysis. In order to convert 1983 constant prices to those of 2002, one should multiply by 1.735. The 'trimmed mean' is the average in which the highest and lowest 5 per cent of values are excluded. These ‘outliers' often significantly distort the overall mean and can lead to misleading conclusions. It is safe to use the trimmed mean so long as there is a sufficiently large number of data points. Where that is not the case, one should use the mean with caution or, better still, take the median value.
