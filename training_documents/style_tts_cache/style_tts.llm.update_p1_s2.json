Yet producing speech with naturalistic prosodic variations, speaking styles, and emotional tones remains challenging. In addition, many existing parallel TTS models often struggle with identifying optimal monotonic alignments since speech and duration generation typically occur independently. Here, we propose StyleTTS, a style-based generative model for parallel TTS that can synthesize diverse speech with natural prosody from a reference speech utterance. Using our novel Transferable Monotonic Aligner (TMA) and duration-invariant data augmentation, StyleTTS significantly outperforms other baseline models on both single and multi-speaker datasets in subjective tests of speech naturalness and synthesized speaker similarity. Through self-supervised learning, StyleTTS can generate speech with the same emotional and prosodic tone as the reference speech without needing explicit labels for these categories. In addition, when trained with a large number of speakers, our model can perform zero-shot speaker adaption. The source code and audio samples can be found on our demo page at https://styletts.github.io/.\nojro | I. INTRODUCTION\nl6t9 | Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, has made significant strides with the advent of deep learning, producing increasingly human-like synthetic speech. However, synthesizing expressive speech that captures the full range of prosodic, temporal, and spectral features, also known as paralinguistic information, remains a challenge. A single piece of text can be spoken in various ways, influenced by context, emotional tone, and a speaker's unique linguistic habits. Hence, TTS is fundamentally a one-to-many mapping problem requiring innovative approaches.\n1ujy | While several strategies have been proposed to address this, including methods based on variational inference, flow-based modeling, controlling pitch, duration and energy, and using external prosody encoder, the production of synthesized speech still falls short of real human speech. In particular, accurately modeling and incorporating different speakers' speaking styles and emotional tones poses a significant challenge.\nqzor | Many attempts have been made to integrate style information into TTS models. These approaches are predominantly based on autoregressive models such as Tacotron. Non-autoregressive parallel TTS models, such as Fastspeech and Glow-TTS, however, have several advantages over autoregressive models. These models generate speech in parallel, enabling fast speech synthesis, and they are also more robust to longer and out-of-distribution utterances. Moreover, because phoneme duration, pitch, and energy are predicted independently from speech, models such as FastSpeech2 and\na0by | FastPitch allow fully controllable speech synthesis. At the same time, these models have limitations. They predominantly concentrate on speech synthesis from a single target speaker and often achieve multi-speaker extensions by concatenating speaker embeddings with the encoder output. Models that explore speech styles also incorporate styles by concatenating style vectors and phoneme embeddings as input to the decoder. This approach may not capture the temporal variation of acoustic features in the target speech effectively. In contrast, the domain of style transfer introduces styles through conditional normalization methods like adaptive instance normalization. This technique has proven effective in neural style transfer, generative modeling, and neural image editing. Application of these methods in speech synthesis has not been extensively explored yet, restricted primarily to voice conversion and speaker adaptation.\nu1ky | The structure of parallel TTS models allows for the entire speech to be synthesized, presenting an opportunity to leverage the powerful AdaIN module for integrating generalized styles in diverse speech synthesis. Recent state-of-the-art models mostly employ the non-autoregressive parallel framework for TTS, but because they do not directly align the input text and speech like autoregressive models do, an external aligner such as the Montreal Forced Aligner that is pre-trained on a large dataset is often required. Since the external aligner is not trained on the TTS data and objectives, the alignments are not optimally suited for the TTS task. Although training internal aligners alleviates some generalization problems, overfitting can occur as the aligners are trained on a smaller TTS dataset with only a mel-reconstruction loss.\nhtm9 | Here, we introduce StyleTTS, a model that addresses the aforementioned challenges of incorporating diverse speaking styles and learning a reliable monotonic aligner. StyleTTS incorporates style-based generative modeling into a parallel TTS framework to enable natural and expressive speech synthesis. It leverages AdaIN to integrate style vectors derived from reference audio, capturing the full spectrum of a speaker's stylistic features. This allows our model to synthesize speech that emulates the prosodic patterns and emotional tones in the reference audio. With various reference audios, we can synthesize the same text in different speaking styles, effectively realizing the one-to-many mapping that many TTS systems find challenging. In addition, our model employs a novel Transferable Monotonic Aligner (TMA) to find the optimal text alignment, aided by a novel duration-invariant data augmentation scheme to produce naturalistic prosody robust to potentially suboptimal duration predictions. Our model's design is robust against the generalization problems of external aligners and\n8hul | overfitting problems that can be caused by internal aligners.\n87vz | This paper presents the following novel contributions: (i) the introduction of the Transferable Monotonic Aligner (TMA), a new transfer learning scheme that refines pre-trained text aligners for TTS tasks, (ii) a duration-invariant data augmentation method for improving prosody prediction, and (iii) a parallel TTS model that incorporates generalized speech styles for natural and expressive speech synthesis. Together, these contributions pave the way for advanced TTS technologies enhancing human-computer interactions.\nym66 | II. METHODS\nl0a3 | A. Proposed Framework\nu8nw | Given T the input phonemes and X an arbitrary reference mel-spectrogram, our goal is to train a system that generates the mel-spectrogram that corresponds to the speech of T and reflects the generalized speech styles of X. Generalized speech styles are defined as any characteristics in the reference audio X except the phonetic content, including but not limited to prosodic pattern, lexical stress, formants transition, speaking rate, and speaker identity. Our framework consists of eight modules that can be divided into three major categories: (i) speech generation modules that include the text encoder, style encoder, and decoder, (ii) TTS prediction modules that include the duration and prosody predictor, and (iii) utility modules only used during training that include the discriminator, text aligner, and pitch extractor. An overview of our framework is provided in Figure one. We detail each of the modules below.\nl2v9 | Text Encoder. The text encoder transforms the phonemes T into a hidden representation htext equals T of T. It consists of a three-layer CNN followed by a bidirectional LSTM.\n```",
