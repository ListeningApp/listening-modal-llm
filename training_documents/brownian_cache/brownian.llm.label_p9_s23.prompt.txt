You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

3g2y | In terms of the physical variables we have
gc7v | <LATEX>\partial _ { k } V _ { k } \left( \chi \right) = \frac { \Upsilon } { 4 } \cdot \frac { 1 } { k + \partial _ { \chi } ^ { 2 } V _ { k } \left( \chi \right) } ,</LATEX> (88)
wqfv | which shows explicitly the effect of dialling the tempera- ture T: the higher the temperature the faster the flow as a result of stronger thermal fluctuations. Equation (88) can be discretised in the <LATEX>\chi</LATEX> direction and become a set of coupled ODEs that can be solved in the <LATEX>k</LATEX> direction in order to obtain a numerical solution.
j30a | It is important to note that equation (88) is identical to the flow of the effective potential that corresponds to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution, see [44] and <LATEX>\mathrm { A p }</LATEX> pendix C with <LATEX>R \rightarrow k</LATEX> k. We therefore see that the form of
7bdk | <LATEX>\mathcal{S} _ { S U S Y }</LATEX> and deriving flow equations that respect its sym- metries establishes automatic consistency with the equi- librium Boltzmann distribution. If one started directly from the Onsager-Machlup functional (30) and naively treated it as an <LATEX>N = 1</LATEX> Euclidean scalar theory in one- dimension with the combination <LATEX>U = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left( V _ { , x } \right) ^ { 2 } - \frac { \Upsilon } { 2 } V _ { , x x }</LATEX> as the scalar potential to be evolved along the RG <LATEX>\stackrel { - } { \mathrm { f l o w } } \mathrm { o n d }</LATEX> would have obtained a different flow equation
fim0 | On <LATEX>\partial _ { k } U _ { k } \left( \phi \right) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \int _ { - \infty } ^ { \infty } \frac { d p } { 2 \pi } \frac { \partial _ { k } R _ { k } } { p ^ { 2 } + R _ { k } + \partial _ { \phi } ^ { 2 } U _ { k } \left( \phi \right) } .</LATEX> (89)
ojro | The corresponding Callan-Symanzik regulator would be <LATEX>R _ { k } = k ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> giving
l6t9 | <LATEX>\partial _ { k } U _ { k } \left( \phi \right) = \frac { 1 } { 2 } \frac { k } { \sqrt { k ^ { 2 } + \partial _ { \phi } ^ { 2 } U _ { k } \left( \phi \right) } } .</LATEX> (90)
1ujy | It is unclear how or if the end-of-the-flow potential <LATEX>U _ { k = 0 }</LATEX> from this equation would relate to the physical potential
qzor | <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } .</LATEX> B. Wave Function Renormalisation
a0by | In the previous subsection we assumed that the effec- tive action <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k }</LATEX> only depends on the renormalisation scale through the form of the potential. We now allow for the <LATEX>\mathrm { f i e l d } \varphi \mathrm { i t s e l f } \mathrm { t o } \mathrm { b e }</LATEX> renormalised which results in a scaling The new effective action in the SUSY formalism is [16]:
u1ky | <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k } \left[ \phi , \bar { \psi } , \psi \right] = \int d t \frac { 1 } { 2 } Z _ { , \phi } ^ { 2 } \dot { \phi } ^ { 2 } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \left( \frac { W , \phi } { Z _ { , \phi } } \right) ^ { 2 }</LATEX> <LATEX>- i \bar { \psi } \left( Z _ { , \phi } ^ { 2 } \partial _ { t } + Z _ { , \phi } Z _ { , \phi \phi } \dot { \phi } - Z _ { , \phi \phi } \frac { W _ { , \phi } } { Z _ { , \phi } } + W _ { , \phi \phi } \right) \psi</LATEX> (91)
htm9 | where we have suppressed the explicit dependence on <LATEX>k</LATEX> of <LATEX>W</LATEX> & <LATEX>Z</LATEX> to avoid overly cluttered notation. From now on we will in general drop this explicit dependence on <LATEX>k</LATEX> for <LATEX>W ,</LATEX> <LATEX>V ,</LATEX> Z & <LATEX>\zeta ,</LATEX> defined below, only restoring it when we are directly comparing it to the original cutoff value. We introduce another identification3 in addition to (26):
8hul | <LATEX>\zeta \left( x \right) = \sqrt { \Upsilon } Z \left( \phi \right) \Rightarrow \zeta _ { , x } = Z _ { , \phi }</LATEX> (92)
87vz | <LATEX>\bar { c } c = - i \zeta _ { , x } \bar { \psi } \psi</LATEX> (93)
ym66 | such that the (on-shell) effective action for Brownian mo- tion is now written as:
l0a3 | <LATEX>\Gamma _ { k } \left[ \chi , \bar { c } , c \right] = \int d t \frac { 1 } { 2 \Upsilon } \zeta _ { , \chi } ^ { 2 } \dot { \chi } ^ { 2 } + \frac { 1 } { 2 \Upsilon } \left( \frac { V _ { , \chi } } { \zeta _ { , \chi } } \right) ^ { 2 }</LATEX> <LATEX>- \bar { c } \left( \zeta _ { , \chi } ^ { 2 } \partial _ { t } + \zeta _ { , \chi } \zeta _ { , \chi \chi } \dot { \chi } - \zeta _ { , \chi } \chi \frac { V _ { , \chi } } { \zeta _ { , \chi } } + \cdot V _ { , \chi \chi } \right) c</LATEX> (94)
u8nw | 10
l2v9 | The regulator term becomes more complicated for this action and we do not reproduce it here, see [16] for details of this. Following their approach one arrives at the LPA <LATEX>+ \mathrm { W F R }</LATEX> flow equations:
afbe | <LATEX>\partial _ { k } V _ { k } \left( \chi \right) = \frac { \Upsilon } { 4 } \cdot \frac { 1 } { k + \partial _ { \chi \chi } ^ { 2 } V _ { k } \left( \chi \right) }</LATEX> (95)
78r8 | <LATEX>\partial _ { k } \zeta _ { , \chi } = \frac { \Upsilon } { 4 } \cdot \frac { \mathcal{P} } { \zeta _ { , \chi } \cdot \mathcal{D} ^ { 2 } }</LATEX> (96)
320g | <LATEX>\mathcal{D} \equiv V _ { , \chi \chi } + k \zeta _ { , \chi } ^ { 2 }</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{P} \equiv \frac { 4 \zeta _ { , \chi \chi } V _ { , \chi \chi \chi } } { \mathcal{D} } - \left( \zeta _ { , \chi \chi } \zeta _ { \chi } \right) _ { , \chi } - \frac { 3 \zeta _ { , \chi } ^ { 2 } V _ { , \chi \chi \chi } ^ { 2 } } { 4 \mathcal{D} ^ { 2 } }</LATEX> (97) (98)
tp8g | which now consist of the previous <LATEX>\mathrm { L P A }</LATEX> equation for the effective potential (88) as expected, augmented by one more flow equation for the wavefunction renormalisation
gxfd | <LATEX>\zeta _ { , \chi } .</LATEX> As before we will integrate the LPA equation (88) by discretising along <LATEX>\mathrm { t h e } \chi</LATEX> direction and solving the result- ing set of coupled ODEs in <LATEX>k .</LATEX> Once the effective potential <LATEX>V _ { k } \left( \chi \right)</LATEX> has been obtained the second PDE can be solved <LATEX>\zeta _ { , \chi }</LATEX> in a similar way. It is worth pointing out here <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { tor } \zeta _ { , \chi } \\ \text { that ol } \end{array}</LATEX> approach differs slightly from [16] in that the ef- fective potential obeys the same equation as in the LPA approximation even with the inclusion of WFR.4 This is because the equilibrium state is described exactly by the LPA equation <LATEX>\left[ 4 3 - 4 5 \right] ,</LATEX> as we mentioned above and explicitly recall in Appendix A. The LPA flow equation was first solved in [16, 44, 45], while more recently WFR was included for a double well potential in [43].
s2v1 | IV. THE EFFECTIVE EQUATIONS OF MOTION
jkp9 | A standard formulation of classical mechanics involves the principle of least action. If one considers the classical action
z8tt | <LATEX>\mathcal{S} :</LATEX> <LATEX>\mathcal{S} = \int d t \left( L \left( x , \dot { x } \right) - j x \right)</LATEX> (99)
9g22 | where <LATEX>L \left( x , \dot { x } \right)</LATEX> is the Lagrangian and a source term has been added, one can obtain the equations of motion by requiring the variational derivative of <LATEX>\mathcal{S}</LATEX> to be zero:
41fx | <LATEX>\frac { \delta \mathcal{S} } { \delta x } = j</LATEX> (100)
7um8 | The Effective Action (EA) <LATEX>\Gamma</LATEX> is so named because its definition makes it look like a classical action but includes the effect of fluctuations that have been integrated out. Defining
uow2 | <LATEX>e ^ { \mathcal{W} \left[ \mathrm { J } \right] } = \int \mathcal{D} \Phi e ^ { - \mathcal{S} \left[ \Phi \right] + \int d t J \Phi }</LATEX> (101)
iat7 | the effective action <LATEX>\Gamma \left[ X \right]</LATEX> is then defined as
ywwr | <LATEX>\Gamma \left[ X \right] = \int _ { t } \mathrm { J } X - \mathcal{W} \left[ \mathrm { J } \right]</LATEX> (102)
0i6j | where
87cq | <LATEX>X = \langle \Phi \rangle .</LATEX> (103)
0qs3 | We then have
z8f7 | <LATEX>\frac { \delta \Gamma } { \delta X } = \mathrm { J }</LATEX> (104)
7w7j | Therefore <LATEX>\Gamma ,</LATEX> the central object of the fRG, leads to effec- tive equations of motion that incorporate the aggregate effects of the thermal fluctuations.5
51vd | A. The EEOM for the one point function
baj1 | In a similar way to how the classical action <LATEX>\mathcal{S} \left( x \right)</LATEX> can yield the classical equations of motion through varia- tional derivatives, so too does <LATEX>\Gamma \left[ \chi \right]</LATEX> yield the effective equation of motion for the one point function (or average position)
n1wo | <LATEX>\chi :</LATEX> <LATEX>\frac { \delta \Gamma } { \delta \chi \left( t \right) } = 0</LATEX> (105)
5bq3 | Here we have assumed there are no external sources6 (J <LATEX>\left. = 0 \right) .</LATEX> Under the <LATEX>\mathrm { I } \mathrm { P A }</LATEX> equation (105) is:
ezla | <LATEX>\frac { \delta \Gamma _ { k = 0 } } { \delta \chi \left( t \right) } = \ddot { \chi } - \partial _ { \chi } V _ { k = 0 } \left( \chi \right) \partial _ { \chi } ^ { 2 } V _ { k = 0 } \left( \chi \right) = 0</LATEX> (106)
rsbu | where the final equality comes by assuming that source terms have been set to zero (i.e <LATEX>\left. J \left( t \right) = 0 \right) .</LATEX> The WFR version of (105) reads:
magd | <LATEX>\left( \zeta _ { , \chi } \dot { \chi } \right) \cdot - \frac { \partial _ { \chi } V _ { k = 0 } } { \zeta _ { , \chi } ^ { 2 } } \left( \partial _ { \chi \chi } ^ { 2 } V _ { k = 0 } - \frac { \zeta , \chi \chi } { \zeta _ { , \chi } } \partial _ { \chi } V _ { k = 0 } \right) = 0</LATEX> (107)
