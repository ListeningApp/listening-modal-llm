o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

1wj6 | Spectra of Water Sonoluminescence
936l | The sonoluminescence spectra of water saturated with helium, argon, krypton, and xenon gases were studied in a 220-500 nm interval. Total light power of sonoluminescence and the yield of hydrogen peroxide increased in the order He < Ar < Kr < Xe. The peak position of the OH* radical at 310 nm did not depend on the dissolved gas, but in the region 2 < 310 nm the light emission had maxima at 262, 268, 250, and 242 nm for He, Ar, Kr, and Xe, respectively. The intensity of this part of the spectra increased in the same order. The results show that sonoluminescence is a kind of luminescence, and the source of sonoluminescence is not blackbody radiation or electrical discharge.
06yq | Introduction
dpv6 | Acoustic cavitation in liquids is accompanied by a number of effects, one of which is the light emission-sonoluminescence (SL). This peculiar phenomenon has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations over the past few decades (see reviews in refs 1-4), but it still remains to be poorly understood.
8r5j | A few hypotheses have been proposed on the mechanism of sonoluminesce and sonochemical reactions. All of the them are based on the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of cavitation bubbles as the source of the phenomenon. Noltingk and Neppiras5 proposed that SL arises from blackbody emission of the adiabatic collapsed cavity. Recently, Hiller et al.,6 studying the spectra of water SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble, suggested sonoluminescence to be blackbody radiation with temperature of heated bubble content of 25 000 K. Atchley et al.7 found that the temperature inside a collapsed cavity can exceed 16 200 K.
2taz | An electrical discharge inside or outside the bubble has been proposed several times for the explanation of SL8 (see also reviews1-4).
o3ya | Some researchers believed that the generation of a shock wave inside the collapsing bubble is the source of sonoluminescence,9 and recently it was found experimentally that SL arises when the speed of a bubble compression exceeds the speed of sound in the gas.10 However, the results of Atchley et al.7a,11 show that it is not necessary, and a speed of 130 m/s is enough to produce SL from a single nonlinearly pulsating cavitation bubble.
r5il | A hot-spot chemiluminescence model12 is based on the opinion that the emission arises from active species that are formed by high temperature inside the cavitation bubble. Taylor and Jarman proposed13 that sonoluminescence is partly chemi- luminescent in its nature and partly due to emission of heated gas.
5gui | Thus, many hypotheses have been proposed, and there is no generally accepted one.
82qc | Spectral investigations of sonoluminescence were carried out in several papers (see reviews1-4). It has been shown that dissolving in liquid gases essentially changes the SL intensity and spectra. 13-16 The spectra of SL of water saturated with oxygen, nitrogen, or their mixture are difficult to interpret because of the large number of emitting light particles, which

tzt3 | can be formed by the chemical reactions inside the cavitation bubble.3,15 On the other hand, the SL spectra of noble gas- saturated water were studied insufficiently, and the interpretation of them is not still realized. This work is devoted to the studies of SL spectra of water saturated with helium, argon, krypton, and xenon gases. A preliminary report of this work has been published.17
t8vv | The objectives of this paper are (i) to reconsider the possible mechanisms of sonoluminescence and (ii) to present the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water and to interpret them. We conclude that SL is not a blackbody radiation or electrical discharge and is a kind of luminescence. The changes of SL spectra in the order of inert gases from helium to xenon are explained by the difference in noble gas characteristics and the peculiarities of the conditions inside the bubble when SL occurs.

kggw | The details of experimental arrangement and procedure are presented in the previous paper.16
xrd1 | Distilled water was sparged with a suitable noble gas for 1 h before ultrasonic irradiation and in the course of spectra acquisition in a 0.5 L glass vessel placed in a thermostated water bath. The liquid was continuously rotated through the irradiation cell (stainless steel with cooling jacket, volume 50 cm3, inner diameter 2 cm) by using a peristaltic pump. Ultrasonic irradiation of water was carried out at 337 kHz with total absorbed power of ultrasound-15.5 W checked calorimetrically. The temperature inside the cell was controlled by a thermistor and maintained at 21 ± 0.5 ℃. It was necessary from 1 to 2 h for stabilizing the transducer output and for the liquid-gas system to achieve the equilibrium, as we worked at high enough intensity of ultrasound and with the cavitation field.15 After that time the spectra were a little modified because of the instability of cavitation field dynamics. To overcome this problem, spectra were collected and averaged from 4 to 10 separate ones.
5746 | The ends of irradiation cell were fitted with the piezoceramic transducer and quartz window, respectively. The resulting sonoluminescence passed into a MDR-23 600 mm grate monochromator with the grating 1200 rulings/mm, which was blazed at 250 nm. The detector was a photomultiplier FEU- 100-tube calibrated in 200-800 nm intervals. The relative response function of the detection system was determined by a 30 W deuterium lamp DDS-30 with measured spectral irradi- ance. Total SL light power was obtained without a monochro-

The resultant output of the photomultiplier was compared with that from a calibrated ß-light source with known spectral irradiance which gave 3.7 x 109 photons s-1 in the 400- 600 nm interval. We did not use D-lamp or ß-light source data for the measurement of the spectral irradiance of sonolumines- cence because of the big value of errors in both these cases. So SL intensity is given in Figure 1 in relative units. The total light power of SL is listed in Table 1.
x972 | Spectra were collected with 2 nm increments in the 220- 500 nm interval as it is well-known that there are not any particular lines or bands in the region of the wavelengths higher than 500 nm for the SL spectra of distilled water.13,15 Ten measurements were acquired in each point and averaged. It was necessary around 20 min to get one spectrum. Separate spectra were smoothed by a method of successive iterations and averaged by 4-10 values.
cwrw | The noise level was measured and subtracted from the spectra. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) depended on the SL intensity and was deteriorated with the decrease of the wavelength. The lower value of S/N was in the case of He-saturated water ~20 at a maximum (310 nm) and ~5 at 220 nm. However, a typical value of the signal-to-noise ratio was much higher. For example, for Ar-saturated water S/N was more than 100 at the maximum and ~20 at 220 nm.
4i0e | The yield of hydrogen peroxide was measured by the potassium-iodine colorimetric procedure18 after suitable time of irradiation of water in the cell with the inlet and outlet ports locked. These experiments were made simultaneously with total SL light power measurements. The initial rates of hydrogen peroxide formation were determined as the slopes of the yield (time) curves.
h2l3 | The number of photons emitted by the excited hydroxyl radical OH* in the 270-350 nm region was compared with the total quantity of hydroxyl radicals OH which were formed inside the individual cavitation bubble. The initial rates of hydroxyl radical formation @0(OH) were calculated as wo(OH) = 2000(H2O2) which follows from the balance equation OH + OH - H2O2. Thus, we assumed here that the reactions of radicals with hydrogen peroxide or others inside the bubble or in the solution after a bubble collapse are insignificant; at least they do not play a prevailing role in most cases. Actually, it is an overestimation, and this will be shown in the Discussion section. On the other hand, the number of OH* photons is evidently overestimated too because the bands of OH* species emission are superimposed in the 270-350 nm interval with the emission from other particles. Nevertheless, we guess that the OH*/OH (or, similarly, OH*/2[H2O2]) ratio is an important parameter for studying the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemistry, and the changes of it in the order of noble gases (see below) support this assumption.
dfzb | Results
u6ty | The spectra of sonoluminescence from noble gas-saturated water were studied in the papers, 13,15,16 but in the work13 the spectra were not investigated at the wavelengths below 270 nm and in the papers15,16 they were not corrected with the spectral response of the detector. So the spectra presented in Figure 1 have an essentially higher intensity at Â < 310 nm than previous ones.13,15,16 Besides, the spectra of He-saturated water had not yet been reported, although the attempt to measure it was made in the work;15 however, the emission was too weak to observe any bands or a continuum.

m047 | Discussion
gy8c | There are a few hypotheses explaining the mechanism of sonoluminescence and sonochemical reactions. In principle, they can be divided into two categories: thermal, when the origin of sonoluminescence and chemical-active particles is explained by the thermal heating of a cavitation bubble content, and electrical, due to electrical discharge inside the bubble or in the surrounding liquid (see reviews1-4). Electrical hypotheses were criticized and rejected,21 but Margulis22 proposed a new one, the essence of which is as follows.
y4mj | The small size bubbles are breaking off from the bigger one that pulsates in a sound field. The neck is formed on the place of detachment, and the electrokinetic <LATEX>\xi</LATEX> -potential can concentrate there because of the flow of a charged liquid around this neck. The value of the <LATEX>\xi</LATEX> potential is excessively great,22 so the electrical discharge can occur inside the gas phase at the time of the bubble detachment.
vpgq | Note that the value of the <LATEX>5</LATEX> &-potential decreases when the concentration of salt in the solution increases.23 Thus, following ref 22 the <LATEX>\mathrm { S L }</LATEX> intensity must also decrease in salt solutions. However, experimental results show an opposite dependence: sonoluminescence increases with the growth of salt concentra- tion in salt solutions.24,25
ousl | It has been shown recently26 that the small additives of perfluorocarbon gases <LATEX>C F _ { 4 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>C _ { 2 } F _ { 6 }</LATEX> in the mixture of <LATEX>\mathrm { A r / C F } _ { 4 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { A r } / C _ { 2 } F _ { 6 }</LATEX> substantially suppress sonoluminescence. Au- thors26 assume that these results are consistent with thermal mechanisms of SL, because these gases have low values of the ratio of specific heats <LATEX>\gamma = c _ { p } / c</LATEX> as compared with noble gases. Thus, the lower the value of <LATEX>\gamma ,</LATEX> the lower cavitational tempera- ture and the less the intensity of SL. On the other hand, <LATEX>C F 4</LATEX> is known as an efficient gas for plasma chemistry and will support an electrical discharge. Thus, the results26 are in direct contradiction with electrical discharge hypotheses and support the thermal mechanism for sonochemistry and sonolumines- cence.
m4ju | It was found recently7a,11,27 that the SL flash from the synchronously repeating stable <LATEX>S L ,</LATEX> which originates from nonlinear motion of a single bubble, occurs in the final stage

Note that the authors of the papers7a,11,27 were working at the intensity of ultrasound that is higher than the threshold of instability of the bubble surface, i.e., at conditions where the bubble disruption and the detachment of tiny bubbles from the bigger one seem incredible.7a
