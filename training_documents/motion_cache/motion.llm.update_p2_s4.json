        "content": "uzo6 | In this paper we propose a characterization of the relative dynamics in a restricted three-body context as seen in a frame local to a target. In particular, we consider a pair of spacecraft, in the following referred to as chaser and target, flying in the vicinity of the smallest primary, in a region where the third-body effect must be explicitly considered into the relative dynamics. Spacecraft position and velocity vectors are expressed with respect to the smallest primary center of mass. Considering, for instance, the Earth-Moon system, this feature is particularly useful in the case one of the spacecraft loses the line of sight with the ground stations on Earth, because measurements are taken with respect to the Moon. In addition, target orbits in restricted three-body scenarios are generally expressed with respect to the smallest primary. The LVLH frame centered on the target is used as a local frame. As opposed to the cited references, the LVLH frame is defined with reference to the smallest primary, in analogy with the frame definition used for rendezvous in Earth orbits, because vehicles incoming from its surface are expected to approach the target. A general set of equations of relative motion in the restricted three-body problem is derived. Conversely to the aforementioned references, the derivation is performed directly in the LVLH frame, making the resulting equation set particularly appealing for rendezvous and docking operations. The only assumption made is the spacecraft having negligible masses with respect to the primaries. Thus, the equations have general validity, and are not restricted to the elliptic or circular three-body problem. Then, the ER3BP and the CR3BP are considered, in order to derive simplified equation sets. A linearization of the sets is also performed in order to provide linear models useful for preliminary relative guidance, navigation, and control system design. The accuracy of the equation sets is analyzed by means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The HLEPP is used as a reference mission scenario, and an Earth-Moon NRHO is considered for the target. Linear two-body-based equation sets were also considered in the analysis, and their accuracy compared against the three-body based sets. Given the chosen reference mission, and in order to ease the general readability, in the paper we will refer to the Earth-Moon system. Nevertheless, application of the proposed equation to other three-body systems is straightforward, because the simplifications considered in the paper are not based on any peculiar characteristic of the lunar orbit or of the Earth-Moon system.\n89b4 | \n5f7e | The paper is organized as follows. In Section two a brief review of the ER3BP and of the CR3BP is provided, and the spacecraft equations of motion with respect to the Moon are derived. Section three discusses the derivation of equations of relative motion for the exact description of the relative dynamics of a chaser spacecraft with respect to a target in the restricted three-body problem context. Possible simplifications of the relative dynamics are discussed in Section four, where four equation sets are derived. The accuracy of the sets is analyzed in Section five. Conclusions are drawn in Section six.\nh83u | Two. Restricted Three-Body Dynamics\nkjoa | Consider the three-body system composed by the Earth and the Moon primary bodies and a spacecraft i, with masses M sub E, M sub M, and m sub i, respectively. Their positions with respect to an inertial frame I is denoted with R sub E, R sub M, and R sub i, respectively.\nwb1c | One thousand three hundred twenty-three\nak13 | m sub i\ns7el | M sub E R sub E equals G M sub M M sub E R sub EM plus G m sub i M sub E R sub EI R sub EM R sub EI\n0lfu | M sub M R sub MLz equals G P m entity two plus G m sub i M sub M\ncnjl | where r sub E I equals R sub i minus R sub E and r sub M I equals R sub i minus R sub M denote the position of the spacecraft i with respect to the Earth and to the Moon, r sub EM equals R sub M minus R sub E is the position of the Moon with respect to the Earth, and G is the universal gravitational constant. Relative positions norms are indicated with r sub E I, m sub I, and r sub EM. The notation R sub z denotes the acceleration of the body as seen from the inertial frame.\nrtdl | Equations of motion of spacecraft i with respect to the Earth and to the Moon are then given by:\nnorp | R sub E ILz equals R sub i minus R sub ELz equals G M sub E plus m sub i r sub e minus r sub E I minus G M sub M seven point three I m sub I plus\nchx3 | (one)\nsfcf | r sub EM\nnuxs | (two)\numx0 | We now assume that the mass of the spacecraft i is negligible with respect to the primaries masses (i.e., m sub i is less than M sub E and m sub i is less than M sub M); that is, we consider the restricted three-body problem. Under this assumption the orbital motion of the two primaries is not affected by the spacecraft, and Equations (one) and (two) simplify to:\no306 | (three)\nqm1b | where H sub E equals G M sub E and U sub M equals G M sub M are the primaries' gravitational parameters.\nn9ms | Assume now that the primaries revolve around their common barycenter in elliptic orbits (elliptic restricted three-body problem). The motion of the two primaries can then be obtained from the solution of the classical two-body problem.\nicdp | The equations of motion for the spacecraft i are generally written in a frame that rotates with the primaries. A Moon or synodic reference frame M: R sub M; I sub M, J sub M, K sub M is introduced, with origin in the Moon center of mass, and unit vectors defined as follows:\nwtse | I sub M equals T sub EM, I sub M equals K sub M cross I sub M, K sub M equals A sub M L E , H sub M L E\nbm7g | where H sub M L E equals r sub EM cross R sub EM Lz is the specific angular momentum of the Moon with respect to the Earth, and H sub M slash E equals absolute value H sub M slash E absolute value; see Figure one. The Earth-Moon system, and consequently the frame M, rotates with respect to the inertial frame I with angular velocity omega M slash I equals omega M slash I K sub M.\njr68 | The acceleration of the spacecraft i in the frame M is given by:\naxix | R sub M ILz equals R sub M I M plus two omega M slash I cross I sub M I M plus omega M slash I cross I sub M plus omega M slash I\n05y4 | cross omega M slash I cross I sub M\n2fb0 | (four)\ns9fn | where two omega M slash I cross R sub M I M is the Coriolis acceleration and omega M slash I cross omega M slash I cross I sub M is the centripetal acceleration term.\nk5r6 | In the Moon frame we have that r sub EM equals negative r sub EM I sub M, and the spacecraft position vectors with respect to the Moon and to the Earth are defined as follows:\nz9v9 | I sub M I equals x M plus V I sub M plus two K sub M, r sub EI equals x sub I minus T sub EM I sub M plus V I sub M plus z sub I K sub M\ngpu9 | Introducing Equation (three) in Equation (four), we obtain the equations of motion for the spacecraft I in the Moon reference frame:",
