You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

gvwz | outlined in figure 1. We next performed stepwise multiple regression analyses, using either response times or error rates as the dependent measure and ROI values as the independent measures. The error rates were very low and varied only slightly between subjects, so no significant correlations emerged, but the response times were of great interest. The rCBF values of three areas were entered into this equation, each accounting for significant amounts of variance in the response times. The first area was Area 17, which by itself was correlated at r =- 0.65 with response times. The other two areas were Area 19 (which we take to implement part of associative memory) and the posterior parietal lobe (which we take to be part of the spatial-properties-encoding system). The multiple R value was 0.93, which is remarkably high given how different measures of rCBF are from response times.
sk5m | Thus, the fact that variations in rCBF in those three areas contributed to variations in performance is evidence that those areas have a role in performing the task. (For comparable results regarding the role of the amygdala in encoding emotional memories see Cahill et al. (1996), and for comparable results regarding the role of the hippo- campus and related structures in episodic memory see Nyberg et al. (1996).)
qws8 | One unexpected finding in Kosslyn et al. (1996b) was that the correlation between parietal rCBF and response time was positive: the more blood flow there was, the more time was needed to respond; in contrast, the other two correlations were negative (the more blood flow, the less time needed to respond). This finding might suggest that people who performed the task relatively poorly might be using a different, less effective, strategy than those who performed it relatively well. Those who performed well seemed to rely on Area 17, which supports visual images of shapes, whereas those who performed poorly had relatively little rCBF in this area. Instead of relying on visual images, the subjects who performed poorly might have relied on spatial representations that are used to guide drawing the segments, and these repre- sentations were accessed via processes implemented in the parietal lobes.
877u | A major virtue of this approach is that no subtractions or comparisons between tasks are necessary. One can design tasks so that there is a single 'rate-limiting' step, and simply correlate responses with rCBF values. However, one must have some prior reason for looking at particular ROIs. In addition, this approach will not allow one to identify all the structures and processes involved in performing a task. Furthermore, as our results should make apparent, it is not entirely clear how to interpret the direction of the correlation between rCBF and a measure of performance. Moreover, if people differ widely in their skill levels, the correlations might be even more difficult to interpret: low values of rCBF for some people might indicate that the process is not performed well, but low values for other people might indicate that they are so expert that only minimal processing is required. Again, results from this method must be viewed as only one more source of converging evidence.
rzhj | (b) Changes in processing
bfax | We have been considering questions to address when a particular process or structure is used. However, 'when'
f2y8 | need not be a constant, but can change depending on a variety of factors. Three such factors in particular seem worth consideration.
o7qm | (i) How does processing change with practice?
d52l | Results from several laboratories have shown that prac- tice does not simply lower rCBF values in areas used when one is performing a given type of task. Rather, entirely new areas can begin to function as one becomes better at performing a task, and areas activated initially can decrease activity below the threshold of detection. For example, we recently performed a simple study (M. T. Menard, W. L. Thompson, P. I. Bentley, L. L. LeSueur, N. M. Alpert, S. M. Kosslyn and A. M. Galaburda, unpublished data) in which subjects were asked to read words aloud. They did this four times, with the particular words being used in each condition being counter- balanced over subjects. As expected, many areas are activated when one reads for the first time compared with the fourth time, but the reverse was also true: additional areas became activated by the fourth blocks of trials that were not activated initially (for comparable results, see Petersen et al. (1998) and Raichle et al. (1994)).
qlbb | In addition to investigating how processing changes with practice, one can ask how this change varies for different populations. For example, the reading-aloud study (M. T. Menard, W. L. Thompson, P. I. Bentley, L. L. LeSueur, N. M. Alpert, S. M. Kosslyn and A. M. Galaburda, unpublished data) compared practice in reading in normal populations and in dyslexics (who were age- and education-matched to the normal control subjects). We found again that some areas activated initially dropped out with practice and that different areas became evident. However, the particular areas were strikingly different from those noted in the controls, in both cases: initially and after practice.
nhsg | Findings such as these are interesting only if they can be interpreted. The interpretation relies on answering questions of the sort that we considered in the first major section of this article. However, this need not be a one- way street. Observations about changes of the sort noted here can lead to hypotheses about what process or structure is implemented in specific areas, and these hypotheses can in turn be examined in ways described above. This 'golden feedback loop' seems more likely to occur if one comes armed with a set of questions from the outset, based on a theory, than if one simply performs neuroimaging while subjects perform a task and then interprets the results post hoc.
hy0l | (ii) How does processing change with context?
4jmz | We also can ask how processing changes in different contexts. Let us return to the Kosslyn et al. (1998) study of mental rotation, summarized above. In that paper, we collapsed over counterbalancing orders for the two types of stimuli, Shepard & Metzler (1971) shapes and drawings of hands. We later realized that there were ample subjects in each group (those receiving hands stimuli first and those receiving Shepard & Metzler stimuli first) for an analysis of each group separately. The most interesting finding here concerned the areas activated while subjects performed the Shepard & Metzler task. When the Shepard & Metzler task was the first one that the subjects
b7cq | received, we found that the inferior parietal and dorso- lateral prefrontal cortex were activated, as well as the right angular gyrus. However, when the subjects received this same task just after having performed the hands task, we found strikingly different results. Not only were over ten areas activated, but many of these areas had previously been found to be involved in motor control. Perhaps most strikingly, we found activation in the primary motor cortex itself, area Ml. When we looked only at the data for the Shepard & Metzler task performed after the hands task, the data were in many ways similar to those for the hands rotation task itself.
