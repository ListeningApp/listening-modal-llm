You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

rs2m | Recall from Section 2.2.1 that, for small values of n, we can think of the response as a polynomial in 7:
uz9y | ra(n) = En, (R) = np1(a) + n2 p2(a) + · + nn-1 pn-1(a) + O(n).
8ov0 | In practice, we want to choose a such that the contribution from nonlinear terms is minimized. There are two main approaches to choosing such an optimal a, by (i) canceling the second-order response, or (ii) bounding the relative error with respect to the linear regime. We next discuss both options.
mj9m | Canceling the second-order response. A first approach to reduce the nonlinear response is to cancel the second-order term 02, as this is the dominant part of the nonlinear bias when n is small. The second-order response is characterized by f2 in (2.25), which reads here
94h3 | (3.12) f2(a) = (Lo1)*(Čphys + @Čextra)*(Lo1)*S = f2,phys + @f2,extra,
9jx1 | where we decomposed the second-order perturbation of the invariant measure into its physical and synthetic parts. Since f2 is linear in a, the value of a for which p2 is

ez9s | cancelled is easily obtained from the definition of the second-order response. Indeed,
mqot | <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } \left( \alpha \right) = \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 2 , \mathrm { p h y s } } \psi _ { 0 } + \alpha \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 2 , \mathrm { e x t r a } } \psi _ { 0 } = \rho _ { 2 } + \alpha \rho _ { 2 , \mathrm { e x t r a } } .</LATEX> Therefore, <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } \left( \alpha ^ { \star } \right) = 0</LATEX> for
oc99 | <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star } = - \frac { \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 2 , \mathrm { p h y s } } \psi _ { 0 } } { \int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 2 , \mathrm { e x t r a } } \psi _ { 0 } } ,</LATEX> (3.13)
gipz | provided that <LATEX>\int _ { \mathcal{X} } R \mathfrak{f} _ { 2 , \mathrm { e x t r a } } \psi _ { 0 } \neq 0 .</LATEX> The latter condition ensures that <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { o x t r a } }</LATEX> has a nontrivial contribution to the second-order response, and can therefore be used to cancel the second-order response. An important remark is that although <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> cancels <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> it might significantly increase <LATEX>\rho _ { 3 }</LATEX> and higher order terms.
b4wj | Note that for Feynman-Kac forcings, the computation of <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> must be reformu- lated. This is due to the fact that (2.25) comes from the Fokker-Planck equation, which admits a nontrivial principle eigenvalue for Feynman-Kac forcings, as discussed in Section 3.2.1 and made precise in Appendix
5xlt | <LATEX>A .</LATEX> In general, the optimal value <LATEX>\alpha ^ { * }</LATEX> cannot be determined a priori. It requires, in principle, two sets of simulations with <LATEX>\alpha _ { 1 } \neq \alpha _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> from which <LATEX>\alpha ^ { * }</LATEX> can be extrapolated due to the linearity of <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } \left( \alpha \right)</LATEX> in <LATEX>\alpha .</LATEX> We discuss in Section 5 how to implement this approach for actual systems of interest.
9bz4 | Remark 3.7. For certain situations, it is possible to determine the impact of the extra perturbations from the response curve for the physical forcing (i.e. <LATEX>\alpha = 0</LATEX> 0). Consider for instance the setting of Example 3.2. We define <LATEX>\mathbb{E} _ { \eta , \alpha } \mathrm { a s } \mathrm { t h e }</LATEX> steady-state average for <LATEX>\psi _ { \eta , \alpha } ,</LATEX> the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta , \alpha } ^ { \dagger } \psi _ { \eta , \alpha } = 0 .</LATEX> Since <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta , \alpha }</LATEX> is proportional to <LATEX>\mathcal{L} _ { \eta / \left( 1 + \alpha \eta \right) , 0 }</LATEX> (recall that we require <LATEX>1 + \alpha \eta \neq 0 ,</LATEX> a simple computation shows that <LATEX>\psi _ { \eta , \alpha } = \psi _ { \eta / \left( 1 + \alpha \eta \right) , 0 } ,</LATEX> so
yfv2 | <LATEX>\forall \eta \in \mathbb{R} , \quad r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) = r _ { 0 } \left( \frac { \eta } { 1 + \alpha \eta } \right) .</LATEX> Then,
pujl | <LATEX>r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) = r _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } \left( 0 \right) \frac { \eta } { 1 + \alpha \eta } + \frac { 1 } { 2 } r _ { 0 } ^ { \prime \prime } \left( 0 \right) \frac { \eta ^ { 2 } } { \left( 1 + \alpha \eta \right) ^ { 2 } } + \mathrm { O } \left( \eta ^ { 3 } \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>= r _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } \left( 0 \right) \eta + \left[ \frac { r _ { 0 } ^ { \prime \prime } \left( 0 \right) } { 2 } - \alpha r _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } \left( 0 \right) \right] \eta ^ { 2 } + \mathrm { O } \left( \eta ^ { 3 } \right) .</LATEX> This allows us to find the optimal <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> which cancels <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> given by
3rqe | <LATEX>\alpha = \frac { r _ { 0 } ^ { \prime \prime } \left( 0 \right) } { 2 r _ { 0 } ^ { \prime } \left( 0 \right) } = \frac { \rho _ { 2 } } { \rho _ { 1 } } .</LATEX> This result suggests that, for the example presented here, the magnitude of the extra forcing should be chosen so that
nsi3 | <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 , \mathrm { e x t r a } } = - \rho _ { 1 } .</LATEX> Bounding the relative error. From a practical viewpoint, and following the usual bias/variance tradeoff, it might be more advantageous to stay close enough to the linear response for larger <LATEX>\eta ,</LATEX> even if that means decreasing the true linear regime.

68a1 | Fig. 2: Illustration of the effect of different a's on the response
seik | order to make these statements quantitative, we consider the relative error <LATEX>\delta</LATEX> in the response relative to the linear response, that is
oq7c | (3.14)
z4mi | <LATEX>\delta _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) = | \frac { r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) - \rho _ { 1 } \eta } { \rho _ { 1 } \eta } | .</LATEX> For an extra perturbation <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathcal{L} } _ { \mathrm { e x t r a } }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\alpha \in \mathbb{R}</LATEX> fixed, the response stays in the <LATEX>n e i g h b o r -</LATEX> hood of the linear response until a certain value of <LATEX>\eta ,</LATEX> at which point it deviates too far from the linear regime. Since <LATEX>\delta _ { \alpha } \left( 0 \right) = 0 ,</LATEX> we look, for some small fixed value <LATEX>\varepsilon > 0 ,</LATEX> for the smallest value of <LATEX>| \eta |</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\delta _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) = \varepsilon ,</LATEX> which we denote by <LATEX>\eta _ { \alpha } \left( \varepsilon \right) .</LATEX> The question of optimizing <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> can be reformulated as finding <LATEX>\alpha</LATEX> such that <LATEX>\eta _ { \alpha } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> is maximized:
hkft | (3.15)
jai3 | <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right) = \arg \max _ { \alpha \in \mathbb{R} } \eta _ { \alpha } \left( \varepsilon \right) , \quad \eta _ { \alpha } \left( \varepsilon \right) = \arg \min _ { \eta \in \mathbb{R} } \left\{ | \eta | : \delta _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) \geqslant \varepsilon \right\} .</LATEX> As we tighten the <LATEX>\mathrm { b o u n d } \varepsilon</LATEX> &, the value of <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> gets closer to the value <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> for which <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 } \left( \alpha ^ { \star } \right) = 0 .</LATEX> This comes from the fact that <LATEX>\eta _ { \alpha } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> is of order <LATEX>\mathrm { O } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> for <LATEX>\alpha \neq \alpha ^ { \star } ,</LATEX> and of order <LATEX>\mathrm { O } \left( \sqrt { \varepsilon } \right)</LATEX> for <LATEX>\alpha = \alpha ^ { \star } .</LATEX> Indeed, <LATEX>\left( 3 . 1 4 \right) c a n</LATEX> be written as
p57i | <LATEX>\delta _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) = | \rho _ { 2 , \mathrm { e x t r a } } \left( \alpha - \alpha ^ { \star } \right) \eta + \mathrm { O } \left( \eta ^ { 2 } \right) | .</LATEX> .
u5ug | Intuitively, canceling the leading order term (namely <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> in the small <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> regime is equivalent to minimizing the deviation from the linear regime, the latter being implied by the limit <LATEX>\varepsilon \rightarrow 0 .</LATEX> Figure 2 illustrates how <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> and <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> can yield drastically different response curves. The functions <LATEX>r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right)</LATEX> are fourth-order polynomials in <LATEX>\eta</LATEX> whose coefficients have been hand-picked in order to demonstrate the possibly very different behaviors of <LATEX>r _ { \alpha ^ { \star } } \left( \eta \right)</LATEX> and <LATEX>r _ { \alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right) } \left( \eta \right) .</LATEX> Figure 2a shows the full response curves <LATEX>r _ { \alpha } \left( \eta \right) ,</LATEX> and Figure 2b shows the corresponding relative error curves relative to the linear response (3.14). The curve obtained by choosing <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> minimizes the deviation from the linear regime for <LATEX>s m a l l \quad n \quad a s \quad t h e \quad s e c o n d - o r d e r</LATEX> response <LATEX>\rho _ { 2 }</LATEX> is canceled. On the other hand, the curve for <LATEX>\alpha _ { \star } \left( \varepsilon \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\varepsilon = 0 . 0 5</LATEX> slightly departs from the linear regime earlier than the one associated with <LATEX>\alpha ^ { \star }</LATEX> *. It stays, however, in the vicinity of the linear response for much larger n. This behavior is more clearly observed in Figure 2b.
