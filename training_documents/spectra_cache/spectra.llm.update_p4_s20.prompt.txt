You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0b39 | The <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { C } } \twoheadrightarrow \widetilde { \mathrm { A } }</LATEX> transition is accompanied by the broad-band emission in the region from 380 to 600 nm with the maximum at 425 nm.32 Excited radical <LATEX>\mathrm { O H } ^ { * } \left( { } ^ { 2 } \Sigma ^ { + } \right) ,</LATEX> formed by reaction 3a, emits light at 280, 310, and 340 nm in the spectra of SL following the 1 - 0, <LATEX>0 \rightarrow 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>0 \rightarrow 1</LATEX> transitions:13,15

1o7p | Sonoluminescence occurs at the final stage of a cavitation bubble compression, with the high pressure inside it. Thus, one can suppose the formation of excimer molecules like (M-OH)*, <LATEX>\mathrm { M } _ { 2 } ^ { * } ,</LATEX> and (M.H2O) *.

57lp | Thus, these particles can contribute to the light emission of the spectra of water sonoluminescence.

d0ik | Consider the possible addition to the SL spectra of the excited atoms and molecules of noble gases. The M2* excimers radiate in broad-band emission with the maximum in the ultraviolet field. This maximum shifts to a short-wave region with the decrease in atomic weight of a gas. For example, the maximum is situated at 170 nm for xenon and at 126 nm for argon.35 The bands at 195 nm (Ar), 220 nm (Kr), and 300 nm (Xe) originate from the reaction of ion-electron recombination like
0x0s | <LATEX>\rightarrow \mathrm { X } ^ { * } *</LATEX> or <LATEX>X ^ { + } + e ^ { - } \rightarrow X ^ { * } \left( { } ^ { 3 } P _ { 1 , 2 } \right) ^ { 3 5 }</LATEX> Such prominent bands in the SL spectra of noble gas-saturated water were not discovered (see Figure 1 and refs 13, 15, and 16). This supports, in our mind, the opinion that electrical phenomena are not major in the mechanism of a cavitation light emission.
4exe | The continuum in the near-ultraviolet field with the maximum at 210 nm (Ar) or 270 nm <LATEX>\left( K r \right)</LATEX> is formed by the transitions36
0myz | <LATEX>X _ { 2 } * * = X _ { 2 } * + h v</LATEX> (8)
xh3i | Note that the maximum of the emission shifts to a longer wave region with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas. Thus, it is impossible to explain the results of Figure 1 by reaction 8 as we observed an opposite dependence: the maxima in the spectra are shifted to the short-wave field with the increase in atomic weight of noble gas (Figure 1).
syiw | The lines of noble gas in the spectra of SL were not also discovered before.13,15,16 This can be a consequence of two causes. First, the excitation energy of noble gases is higher than that one of water; thus, the temperature inside the cavitation bubble is not high enough for the formation of excited molecules or atoms of noble gases. Second, water molecules quench effectively the excited states of noble gas atoms.37
kg3t | Thus, the continuum in the spectra is formed by fast transition <LATEX>\left( \approx 1 0 ^ { - 1 2 } s ^ { 3 2 } \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { C } } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { B } _ { 1 } \twoheadrightarrow \widetilde { \mathrm { A } } ^ { 1 } \mathrm { B } _ { 1 }</LATEX> (reaction 4b) and by the recom- <LATEX>b i n a t i o n \left( 7 \right) .</LATEX> Note that the vibrational excited water molecules can also be formed by reaction 1.
lvae | It is still not clear what kind of species emits the light at wavelengths below 310 nm. Sehgal et al.15 believe that this emission occurs by the transition
o9sc | <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \left( { } ^ { 3 } B _ { 1 } \right) \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O \left( { } ^ { 1 } A _ { 1 } \right)</LATEX> (9)
121u | In addition, they write that " ... The short wavelength cutoff at <LATEX>2 3 5 - 2 4 5</LATEX> nm or 113-117 kkal/mole gives the heat of reaction <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O \rightarrow H + O H</LATEX> (all in the ground state) at 0 K in good agreement with the thermal value of 119 kkal/mole".15 Prob- ably, authors of that paper assumed that the emission originates by two-body collision with the radiative stabilization of the product:
zh03 | <LATEX>H + O H \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O ^ { * } \rightarrow H _ { 2 } O + h v</LATEX> (10)
