You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

5lm9 | where the plastic capacities (i.e. Vp and Mp) are calculated based on the nominal yield stress, Fy. For links with length ratios less than 2.0 the first term will govern; however, for longer links the second term is dominant. In order to meet the objectives of the capacity design approach, it is necessary to estimate the maximum shear force that can develop in a link during an intense loading, i.e. Vmax- Consequently, other structural members shall be designed to remain essentially elastic and resist the loads developed by the fully yielded and strain hardened link. Any underestimation of the maximum link force may lead to unfavorable failures in other members. To have a reliable estimate of Vmax the link overstrength concept is generally utilized as follows:
wp2c | Vmax =92(R,V2) =QV (2)
us5v | where Ry is the ratio of expected to nominal yield stress, considered for each steel grade based on statistical data, Ve is the expected (or actual) shear capacity of the link, and Q is the overstrength factor due to strain hardening. Early experimental studies by Popov and his colleagues [4, 6, 11, 15, 16] suggested the value of Q = 1.5 for design purposes, which is still (implicitly) in use in most seismic design specifications (e.g. [3, 17]). The link overstrengths observed in the previous experimental studies on horizontal I-shaped links [6, 11, 14, 15, 18-39] are presented in Figure 4. The traditional line of Q2 = 1.5 is also depicted in this figure. It should be mentioned that the value of Ve for every data point is calculated using the measured properties reported in the original reference. Only cyclic test results for links with Fy > 200 MPa are included in the figure. A summary of the experiments conducted between 1983 and 2002 on EBF links is also presented by Richards [40] in his dissertation. Most of the links tested by Popov and his colleagues [6, 9, 11, 15, 19] were constructed from A36 steel, while links with higher strength steels such as A709 and A992 were tested later by other researchers such as McDaniel [24], Okazaki and his colleagues [31, 33], Mansour et al. [41], and Dusicka et al. [36]. Shear links constructed from low-yield-strength steels were also tested more recently by Dusicka et al. [36] and Ji et al. [14].
rs2m | As can be seen in Figure 4, the value of <LATEX>\Omega = 1 . 5</LATEX> seems like a reasonable upper-bound for links with <LATEX>\rho > 1 .</LATEX> However, this overstrength value overestimates <LATEX>V _ { m a x }</LATEX> for some intermediate links <LATEX>\left( 1 . 6 < \rho < \right.</LATEX> 2.6) and drastically underestimates <LATEX>V _ { m a x }</LATEX> for very short links <LATEX>\left( \rho < 1 \right) .</LATEX> There are several reasons for these discrepancies, which can be summarized as follows.
uz9y | Using a constant value of 1.5 for the overstrength factor neglects the effect of moment-shear (M- V) interaction. However, the study by Engelhardt and Popov [11] proved that this interaction can be important for intermediate links where <LATEX>\Omega</LATEX> values lower than 1.5 were observed (Figure 4).
8ov0 | The nominal shear capacity of short links is generally calculated based on the web area, neglecting the contribution of the flanges [3]. However, as mentioned by McDaniel et al. [24], in short links with relatively thick flanges, there is a significant shear force carried by the flanges. Manheim and Popov [8] and Richards [40] have proposed methods for determining the link plastic shear capacity considering the flange effect. Through nonlinear FE analysis of isolated links, Richards [40] demonstrated that the overstrength factor of 1.5 is a reasonable limit even for very short links, provided that the flange effect is included in determining <LATEX>V _ { P } .</LATEX> However, the same conclusion was not reached when previous test results on short and very short built-up links [21, 22, 24, 42] were examined. The calculated overstrengths for these links decreased slightly by including the flange effect in determining <LATEX>V _ { I }</LATEX> however, they were still significantly higher than 1.5 for most cases. Richards [40] attributed this discrepancy to the presence of other factors, beside the flange effect, in experimental studies. In 2007, Okazaki and Engelhardt [31] reported the test results for a total of 37 links constructed from ASTM A992 steel. Although not very short, some of the specimens had very high ratios of flange to web area <LATEX>\left( A _ { f } / A _ { w } \right) .</LATEX> These specimens however did not exhibit overstrengths substantially higher than 1.5. On the contrary, other recent results by <LATEX>\mathrm { J i }</LATEX> et al. [14] indicated that very short links with even lower flange to web area ratios could achieve remarkably high overstrengths, in some cases even over 2.0. A further numerical investigation by Ji et al. [14] revealed that for the tested specimens the shear contribution of flanges could be as much as <LATEX>0 . 2 V _ { P } .</LATEX> However, it was concluded that other factors in addition to the flange effect are influential in causing the observed high overstrengths. Thus, it can be deduced that the numerical and experimental studies are inconclusive about the contribution of flanges to the link overstrength.
mj9m | If axial restraints are present at the link ends, tension can develop during shearing, due to nonlinear geometric effects, especially at high rotation angles [40]. In 2012, this crucial issue was investigated by Della Corte et al. [43] using detailed FE analyses considering both geometric and material nonlinearities. Based on the numerical results it was concluded that the presence of axial restraints can significantly increase the overstrength (up to 15% increase was reported in some models) especially for short links. In a more recent study, Ji et al. [14] also mentioned that restraining axial deformations of very short links by adjacent members can create non-negligible axial forces in these links and affect their behavior significantly.
94h3 | Another possible cause for the very high overstrengths observed in some tests is the excessive cyclic hardening of steel due to very large plastic strains. This idea was introduced recently by Ji et al. [14] on the basis of an experiment conducted by Kasai et al. [44] on stocky short steel panels in which hardening continued to very large shear angles. Based on this observation, Ji et al. [14] proposed that the very high overstrengths reported for very short links are related to their high rotation capacities. These links experience large plastic rotations (substantially higher than 0.08 rad) and consequently their webs are subjected to excessive shear strains which may lead to excessive cyclic hardening. A refined FE analysis by Ji et al. [14] on very short links revealed that for a link plastic rotation of the order of 0.15 rad the cyclic hardening effect can increase the shear strength by about 70%.
