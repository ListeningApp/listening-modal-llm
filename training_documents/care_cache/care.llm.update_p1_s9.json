The relatively new field of implementation science has developed to enhance the uptake of evidence-based practices and thereby increase their public health impact.\njc47 | Implementation science shares many characteristics, and the rigorous approach, of clinical research. However, it is distinct in that it attends to factors in addition to the effectiveness of the clinical innovation itself, to include identifying and addressing barriers and facilitators to the uptake of evidence-based clinical innovations.\nko3c | This article reviews the definition, history, and scope of implementation science, and places the field within the broader enterprise of biomedical research. It also provides an overview of this Special Issue of Psychiatry Research, which introduces the principles and methods of implementation science to mental health researchers.\nxek3 | One. Why worry about implementation?\nbbpr | The title of this article poses two questions. Let us answer the second question first, beginning with a story:\n5zyf | It was, by all estimations, a successful research effort. We had mounted a randomized, controlled clinical trial across eleven sites in the US Department of Veterans Affairs, testing an organization of care called the Collaborative Chronic Care Model for bipolar disorder versus treatment as usual. Over three years of follow-up, the Collaborative Chronic Care Model showed significant positive impact on weeks in mood episode, mental health quality of life, social role function, and satisfaction with care-all at no increased cost to the healthcare system. In parallel, a two-year, four-site randomized controlled clinical trial of the bipolar Collaborative Chronic Care Model in the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, showed very similar outcomes at minimal cost, compared to treatment as usual. Both studies were published in the same year in mainstream psychiatric journals that are read and respected by mental health researchers, clinicians, and administrators. The Collaborative Chronic Care Model for bipolar disorders began to be endorsed by national clinical practice guidelines in the US Department of Veterans Affairs and in Canada, and the bipolar Collaborative Chronic Care Model was listed on the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's prestigious National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices.\n9own | A worthwhile innovation in care? It was a no-brainer: improved outcome at little to no cost.\nbqfb | And yet, within a year of the end of the studies, none of the fifteen sites had incorporated the Collaborative Chronic Care Model into their usual workflow. The clinicians who had participated in the Collaborative Chronic Care Model went back to their usual duties, and the individuals with bipolar disorder went back to receiving their usual form of care. For all practical purposes, bipolar Collaborative Chronic Care Models ceased to exist at these sites. Perhaps ironically, the only vestige of the Collaborative Chronic Care Model that remained one year after the study was that a group of patients at one of the sites continued to meet on their own to hold self-management skills groups, which were part of the Collaborative Chronic Care Model intervention.\nwwdt | Everything went right. What went wrong?\nmn1r | The experience in the story is not unique, as many clinical trialists have discovered. Succinctly put: Establishing effectiveness of an innovation does not guarantee its uptake into routine usage. Classic studies indicate that it takes seventeen to twenty years to get clinical innovations into practice; moreover, fewer than fifty percent of clinical innovations ever make it into general usage. Chalmers and Glasziou estimate that eighty percent of medical research dollars do not make a public health impact for various reasons. If only half of clinical innovations ever make it to general use, society's return on investment for each medical research\n5vqw | dollar is diminished even further. Funders are beginning to take note.\nmeyw | Perhaps this lack of uptake of clinical innovations (among which we consider interventions, assessment and treatment technologies, and new organizations of care) is because the rapid pace of modern biomedical research has outstripped society's absorptive capacity. On the contrary: the problem is centuries old. For instance, the first observation that citrus cures scurvy in the British Navy occurred in sixteen zero one, with the first randomized controlled trial of citrus to treat scurvy conducted in seventeen forty-seven. Yet the British Navy did not adopt routine use of citrus to prevent scurvy until seventeen ninety-five, and the British merchant marine not until eighteen sixty-five.\n2e62 | Additional instances of the lag between evidence and widespread usage are provided by Colditz and Emmons. They contrast the slow uptake of the smallpox vaccine, penicillin, and insulin to the much more rapid uptake of anti-retroviral treatments for HIV and AIDS, making the point that contextual factors, not treatment effectiveness, play a dominating role in whether and how quickly a clinical innovation will become widely used. Similarly, Ferlie and coworkers studied non-adoption of eight hospital-based or primary care-based innovations in the UK. Their analysis demonstrated that, while strength of evidence contributed to the adoption of some clinical innovations, a more comprehensive explanation for non-adoption needed to also include contextual issues, such as the professional disciplines of the intended recipients.\n75y3 | Thus, the problem of non-uptake of effective clinical innovations is longstanding and persistent-and likely the rule rather than the exception. Moreover, the clues to this problem lie beyond simply the clinical innovation itself, and include contextual and factors related to use or non-use of the clinical innovation.\ns2g2 | Two. Implementation challenges in the biomedical research enterprise\nq1q2 | The process of biomedical research can be conceptualized as a pipeline from concept development to public health impact. Those of us who came into research several decades ago worked from a simplistic model which assumed that developing evidence that a clinical innovation was efficacious was sufficient to generate public health impact.\ncb7r | In the late nineteen nineties researchers became aware of the need for studies, particularly clinical trials, which moved out of the rarified environment of the academic medical center into venues more typical of those in which the clinical innovation would be used. Thus, the focus of clinical research broadened beyond solely internal validity (which prioritizes isolating treatment effects from all extraneous influences in order to determine whether an innovation has an impact), to also include considerations of external validity (which prioritizes the relevance and transferability of innovation effects from highly controlled experimental conditions into conditions under which the eventual end-user of the innovation typically works).\n68xu | Accordingly, a variety of types of clinical trials that prioritize external validity developed under the general concept of \"practice-based research\". Such trial designs are based on a variety of overlapping concepts-e.g., effectiveness studies, practical clinical trials, pragmatic clinical trials, comparative effectiveness trials, large simple clinical trials-but all have in common prioritizing evaluation of clinical innovations in environments in which the innovation will potentially be used. The biomedical research pipeline can thus be amended to illustrate an \"efficacy-effectiveness\" continuum, in which trials differ based on whether they seek primarily to favor study efficacy (internal validity, i.e., isolating and maximizing potential treatment impact) versus effectiveness (external validity, i.e., generalizability to the practice settings in which the clinical innovation will be used).\nhd35 | Upper Panel:\n```",
