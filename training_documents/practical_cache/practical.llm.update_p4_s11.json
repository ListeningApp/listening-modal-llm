        "content": "v3r2 | According to Siles et al., non-enhanced MR cholecystopancreatography visualization of the entire extrahepatic bile duct system, including confluence of intrahepatic bile ducts, is possible but was only observed in sixty-two point five percent of neonates and infants younger than three months in a normal physiological state. For infants younger than thirty days, this result dropped to fifty percent. This compromises the ability of MR cholecystopancreatography to exclude the diagnosis of biliary atresia at the optimal time for surgery.\nnv42 | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy\nxags | Hepatobiliary scintigraphy uses Tc-ninety-nine m-labelled iminodiacetic acid derivatives as a radiotracer. Patient preparation for imaging should include phenobarbital to activate liver excretory enzymes and increase bile flow for a minimum of three to five days before the hepatobiliary imaging study. Scintigraphy can exclude biliary atresia by demonstrating transit of radiotracer into the bowel. Cholescintigraphic images should be acquired at multiple times up to twenty-four hours.\njc47 | A meta-analysis by Kianifar et al. included eighty-one studies (age range: four to one hundred eighty days) reporting a sensitivity of ninety-nine point three percent (range: ninety-eight point three to ninety-nine point eight percent), a specificity of seventy-five point one percent (range: seventy-two point two to seventy-seven point nine percent), a positive likelihood ratio of three point one nine (range: two point four seven to four point one one), a negative likelihood ratio of zero point zero seven (range: zero point zero four to zero point one one) and a diagnostic odds ratio of sixty point one. The negative predictive value was high, about one hundred percent, but the positive predictive value was lower and false-positive results occurred in some patients with severe medical cholestasis. In hepatobiliary scintigraphy studies, renal or urinary excretion of the tracer could be confused with transit of radiotracer into the bowel and lead to a false-negative result.\nko3c | Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography\nxek3 | Seven percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography studies were identified for initial review. Four were identified as\nbbpr | relevant. Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography is a US-guided technique performed under general anaesthesia or sedation with local anaesthesia. A twenty-two to twenty-five-gauge needle is used to puncture the gallbladder through the liver parenchyma and inject a nonionic contrast medium to obtain a cholangiogram. Antibiotic prophylaxis is usually given. Bile aspiration, when the gallbladder is distended enough, allows for sampling of bile for biochemical studies in suspected genetic cholestasis. The decision to perform a percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography is informed by case-by-case discussion. If the gallbladder is visible, one may try to puncture it, while acknowledging the risk involved. Lee et al. reported no complications related to percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography and obtained a technical success in eighteen of twenty-two procedures (age range: one to one hundred thirty-eight days, mean age: forty-nine point seven days). Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography has a spatial resolution higher than MR cholecystopancreatography and allows observation of the direct progression of the iodine in the biliary tract. It is useful to confirm or rule out biliary atresia in difficult cases. The absence of retrograde filling of contrast in the intrahepatic bile ducts is highly suggestive of biliary atresia. In some cases of biliary atresia, there is a very thin and irregular opacification of the intrahepatic bile ducts and no opacification of the duodenum. In non-biliary atresia cholestasis, opacification of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and duodenum is always seen. Some typical patterns may allow differential diagnosis, such as in neonatal sclerosing cholangitis. Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography can\n5zyf | determine the type of biliary atresia and gallbladder patency. Zhou et al. proposed percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography by using contrast-enhanced US in infants suspected of having biliary atresia with equivocal US findings and a gallbladder longer than one point five centimeters. This is an interesting pilot study in which biliary atresia was diagnosed in four patients and excluded in five patients without procedural-related complications. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the diagnostic performance and limits of this technique. It is noteworthy that the technique can be performed only when a gallbladder lumen is accessible.\n9own | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\nbqfb | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed to evaluate the patency of the biliary tree in the diagnosis of biliary atresia in some tertiary referral centers. Full delineation of the biliary system excludes biliary atresia. Another sign includes the absence or presence of bile at the site of the papilla. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography requires specific infant endoscopy equipment not available at many centers; it is usually performed under general anaesthesia. The endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography sensitivity ranges between eighty-six percent and one hundred percent, with the specificity seventy-nine to ninety-four percent, positive predictive value eighty-eight to ninety-six percent and negative predictive value one hundred percent (age range: nineteen to one hundred seventy-five days).\nwwdt | Percutaneous liver biopsy\nmn1r | Percutaneous liver biopsy is performed in most pediatric centers during the diagnostic work-up of infants with cholestatic jaundice. The diagnosis is challenging because the histological features of many disorders causing infantile cholestasis overlap, evolve and vary with age. The diagnostic accuracy of liver biopsy for biliary atresia diagnosis is between sixty percent and ninety-five percent. We have analyzed studies with liver biopsy as the only method for diagnosis. The earliest histological changes of biliary atresia might be relatively nonspecific, and biopsies performed too early in the course of the disease might result in a false-negative result. In a meta-analysis performed by Wang et al. including thirty-eight papers, the sensitivities and specificities of individual studies varied from ninety percent to one hundred percent and from eighty-four percent to one hundred percent, respectively (age range: twelve to one hundred twenty days). The percutaneous liver biopsy showed pooled sensitivity of ninety-eight percent (ninety-five percent confidence interval [CI] ninety-six to ninety-nine percent), specificity of ninety-three percent (ninety-five percent CI eighty-nine to ninety-five percent), positive likelihood ratio of twelve point zero nine (ninety-five percent CI eight point two eight to seventeen point six three) and negative likelihood ratio of zero point zero three (ninety-five percent CI zero point zero two to zero point zero six). The positive predictive value was ninety-three point zero percent and the negative predictive value was ninety-seven point seven percent.",
