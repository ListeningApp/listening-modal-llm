You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

bfax | By 1977, there were between 150 and 250 monitors. They were either full-time Executive Officers or part-time Community Organizers working outside office hours. The Home Affairs Department built up a regularly updated contact list of about 10,000 people. 63 The list was claimed to 'cover a wide cross-section of occupation groups, strati- fied in respect of age and educational background'.64 About 300 to 400 people were selected from the list for each MOOD issue. Apart from interviewing people on the con- tact list, the Home Affairs Department staff spoke to people in the community. The num- ber of these incidental samples varied in different districts. It ranged from 2000 to 3000 in total. In normal circumstances, no respondent was interviewed more than once in less than four months.65 As the Chief Secretary and the Secretary for Administration imposed the duties of assessing and predicting public reactions towards proposed and existing policies, on request, the Home Affairs Department was obliged to report opinion trends on specific topics to relevant departments directly.66
f2y8 | MOOD was a qualitative research project, which adopted an informal interviewing system modelled on the Osaka Feedback Scheme and the Japanese Monitor System for National Policy.67 Each report had tailor-made topics and targeted groups. Tests and pilot surveys were carried out in advance, such as checking the sample coverage and anticipat- ing non-response rate. This was done to determine the method used in soliciting views, for example, whether through observations, sending out questionnaires, or interviews.68 If it was in the format of interviews, 'informal' techniques were employed. Questions were not standardized. Staff could tailor the wording and alter the order of the questions which they believed were appropriate for the contacts. Such unstructured approach, it was judged, succeeded 'better than set questions in getting to the heart of the respond- ent's opinion'.69
o7qm | To further improve the methodology of MOOD, it was recommended that a depart- mental representative should attend discussions if that report was requested by a particu- lar department.70 As MOOD only covered Kowloon and Hong Kong island, the presence of the staff of the New Territories Administration, such as the District Officer of Tsuen Wan, was useful. Not only could they learn the techniques for contacting interview sub- jects, but information from the New Territories could also be gathered and used for com- parison.71 On important topics, such as Green Papers on constitutional development, the department used 'more scientific methods' to gather and ascertain public views regu- larly.72 To enhance the report's credibility, three-quarters of the contacts in each issue of MOOD were incidental casual respondents. The established contact lists in different dis- tricts were renewed and the categorical breakdown, such as age and occupation of

nhsg | respondents, was sent to the Census and Statistics Department.73 These new arrange- ments were made possibly because City District Officers and monitors approached some better-informed and responsive respondents repeatedly, affecting the representativeness of MOOD. These changes also lowered the risks that officials carried out fewer inter- views than required.
hy0l | By 1979, the Home Affairs Department was still reluctant to change the sampling method extensively due to 'the extra work involved' and the fact that 'it was impractical with the then limited resources'.74 Nonetheless, the frequency was changed and MOOD was issued on a monthly basis, allowing more time for fieldwork.75 It was not until April 1980 that the Home Affairs Department switched to a quota sampling method. The selec- tion of contacts according to gender, age and occupation was now in proportion to the number and distribution of the overall population in the area. This new method was adopted probably because of the changing geographical distribution of Hong Kong's population. According to the government census in 1971, 25 per cent of the total popula- tion lived on Hong Kong island, 18 per cent in Kowloon, 37 per cent in New Kowloon, and 17 per cent in the New Territories. By 1981, the distribution had changed, with a large increase in the New Territories: 24 per cent of the total population lived on Hong Kong island, 16 per cent in Kowloon, 33 per cent in New Kowloon and 26 per cent in the New Territories.76 This per district approach represented a better division of labour as it reduced the cost and time for travelling to other districts. City District Officers also had better understanding of the areas and neighbourhoods in their own districts. The new methodology reduced the sampling size from 2500 to 993. These 993 respondents now included people in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Chung.77
4jmz | This section has demonstrated how the bureaucracy invested considerable resources polling a representative sample of people, a mass made structurally invisible by the colo- nial state. The colonial government regularly collected and analysed public opinion, and closely monitored the movement of opinion direction. The circulation of sensitive public opinion was restricted to senior policymakers, including the Governor and his policy advisers, and was referenced in policy formulation.
b7cq | Political attitudes and identities of Hong Kong Chinese
0b39 | The improved methodologies allowed MOOD to deconstruct changing popular senti- ments by class and age, and hence assess public reactions to administrative reforms and identify potential threats to the colonial state. MOOD investigated topics which were either 'of current interest or political importance chosen by the Home Affairs Department', or which had been requested by a Secretary or Head of Department.78 During the period from March 1975 to June 1976, MOOD covered a number of ad hoc affairs, including public reactions to the Labour Relations Bill, the proposed increase in public transport charges, school fees, and electricity prices. The colonial government also displayed a clear interest in political attitudes and identities, and what influenced them. Changing political attitudes of Hong Kong Chinese towards the colonial government, the United Kingdom, and China were the state's main concerns in this period. For an alien state to retain legitimacy without introducing an electoral system, 'not only must legitimate demands be satisfied, but the population must be convinced that such satisfaction is
qecd | genuinely the objective of the government'.79 The colonial regime was desperate to develop a sense of 'civic pride' as a substitute for 'national loyalty' among the Chinese population.80 It was believed that this not only enhanced the state's legitimacy, but also provided Britain with powerful bargaining chips in their negotiations with China.81 Along with the Hong Kong Festival and the 'Keep Hong Kong Clean' campaign, the state introduced legislative changes, such as legalizing Chinese to become the official language in 1974.82
1o7p | Nonetheless, there were increased tensions between Hong Kong and Britain. The devaluation of the pound in 1967 had drastically affected public confidence in the British government. To add fuel to the fire, Britain's entry into the European Economic Community curtailed Hong Kong's textile exports to the British Isles under more restric- tive quotas. London also increased Hong Kong's contribution to the maintenance of the British garrison from 29 per cent in 1970 to 75 per cent in 1978.83 On the other hand, the 1967 riots had already demonstrated the significance of the 'China factor': a surge in Chinese nationalism could lead to violence and chaos, shattering political stability. Nationalism did not diminish but flourished in the early 1970s, which could be observed from the emergence of patriotic social movements, such as the Chinese Language Campaign and the Senkaku Islands Movement. Given the uncertainty imposed by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the death of Mao and the fall of the Gang of Four after 1976, the state had to observe changing perceptions towards China. In this context, it was vital for the state to be fully informed of changing political attitudes and identities so that it could measure the success of its community-building project, continue fostering a sense of belonging among the community, and avoid any anti-colonial or British senti- ments being exploited and turned into disturbances.
