As opposed to previous models proposed in the literature, the relative motion is studied in a frame local to the target spacecraft, the local-vertical local-horizon frame, and spacecraft state is expressed with respect to the primary about which they are orbiting. The exact description of the relative dynamics is derived, as well as simplified equation sets based on both the elliptic and the circular restricted three-body problems. The accuracy of the simplified sets is analyzed by means of extensive numerical simulations on a realistic rendezvous scenario with a target on lunar orbit.\nd1j2 | One. Introduction\nwstc | The study of the spacecraft relative dynamics is one of the most trending topics in the space research field. As a matter of fact, the characterization of the relative motion is a critical step in the design and the analysis of all the space missions requiring the coordination of two or more spacecraft. Notable examples are rendezvous and docking missions and formation flying, which have drawn the interest of the space community for decades. Worth of mention are also future missions such as in-orbit servicing, debris mitigation, and assembly of large orbital structures, which are increasing the interest in the subject.\nba1e | Relative motion in the two-body problem and, in particular, in near-Earth orbits has been studied extensively. The first and most remarkable models were proposed during the nineteen sixties: the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations and the Tschauner-Hempel equations. For years, these sets of equations have been the model of reference for the analysis and the design of relative guidance, navigation, and control systems, because they provide linear models for the study of relative motion in circular and elliptic orbits. However, the two sets are based on the following main assumptions: the spacecraft relative\nen95 | separation is significantly small compared with the distance from the primary body center of mass, and no orbital perturbations act on them. These assumptions limit the use of the two equation sets in applications such as formation flying, which generally requires to maintain formations over long mission times, while satisfying high-accuracy requirements in order to meet the mission objectives. In such cases orbital perturbation must be taken into account in order to predict the long-term motion, and the linearization error may be non-negligible if long baselines are considered. Therefore, a wide variety of models have been proposed in the literature to overcome these limitations.\nl3do | The attention received by the study of relative motion in three-body scenarios is not comparable to the two-body case. Depending on the three-body system considered, when the spacecraft fly near the biggest primary, the influence of the second primary is generally modeled as an orbital perturbation (third-body perturbation). However, several missions under study are targeting celestial bodies where the third-body influence must be explicitly taken into account in the relative dynamics. Two examples are Phobos Sample Return mission and the Human Lunar Exploration Precursor Program. With reference to the former, the orbital dynamics around Phobos is particularly complex, because the small mass-ratio and length-scale of the Mars-Phobos system result in a sphere of influence of the Martian moon, which is very close to its surface. Hence, the two-body problem is an inaccurate approximation of the spacecraft's dynamics in the vicinity of Phobos. In the Human Lunar Exploration Precursor Program an habitable station, the Deep Space Gateway, will fly a near-rectilinear halo orbit. Again, two-body-based equation sets cannot be used in this context, because non-Keplerian orbits typical of three-body systems are considered, and models based on the two-body problem generally exploit the characteristic of the Keplerian orbits. Therefore, ad hoc models for relative motion description in the three-body problem must be identified.\nu9bo | The approach generally adopted in the literature is based on the numerical computation of the difference between the equations that regulate the motion of the two spacecraft. More specifically, the circular restricted three-body problem is used to model the single spacecraft dynamics, and then the difference is used to numerically describe the relative motion. Examples of this kind of approach applied to formation-flying and rendezvous missions can be found. This type of description has two main limitations. First the use of circular restricted three-body problem equations is inaccurate for some three-body systems, as, for instance, in the Earth-Moon and in the Mars-Phobos cases, where the system eccentricity has a non-negligible influence. Hence, the elliptic restricted three-body problem must be considered. Second, these sets are developed in a frame rotating with the primaries, generally referred to as the synodic or pulsating reference frame, and centered on one of them, or on their common center of mass, or even in a libration point. Historically, relative motion, especially in rendezvous missions, is studied in a frame local to the target or leader spacecraft, such as the local-vertical local-horizon\n7avo | frame. This choice eases the integration of measurements acquired by spacecraft relative positioning sensors. In addition, the use of a local frame allows to better understand and to characterize the chaser or follower dynamics as seen from the target or leader. This is particularly important in rendezvous and docking missions, in order to analyze and to assess the safety of the maneuvers performed by an incoming chaser spacecraft. Some studies try to solve these limitations. For instance, local frames are considered but only for the analysis and the visualization of the results, not for derivation of the equations of relative motion. The general restricted three-body problem setup is considered, but spacecraft position and velocity is considered with respect to the Sun-Earth L Two libration point, and the relative motion is expressed in the synodic frame.\n```",
