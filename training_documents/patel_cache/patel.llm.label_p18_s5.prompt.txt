You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

863b | They'd given him no choice, Patel reasoned. Somewhere along the way, the plot against the king had turned into a plot against the wizard himself.
fj24 | B Y THE WINTER of 2018, Republicans had lost the House, and Schiff was set to take over the intelligence committee. Patel later wrote that Nunes, as promised, urged Trump to hire his protégé onto the National Security Council. According to Patel, when Trump realized just whom Nunes was referring to -the man who "had saved his presidency by revealing the unprecedented political hit job designed to take him down"-he ordered his chief of staff to onboard Patel at once.
uz3c | Former administration officials told me that, from his first days as a staffer on the National Security Council, in February 2019, Patel was fixated on trying to get face time with Trump. He had a script, and it wasn't long before many of his colleagues could recite it themselves: "Mr. President, the deep state is out to get you," as the longtime Trump adviser paraphrased it, "and I'm going to save you from it." Five months into his tenure, Patel was made the senior director of the NSC's counterterrorism directorate.
d5bi | Much has been written about Patel's year on the National Security Council, including the early suspicions among his colleagues that he was funneling information about Ukraine directly to Trump, outside official channels. In the former president's first impeachment inquiry, the NSC official Fiona Hill testified about learning from another colleague that Trump apparently viewed Patel as the council's director on
ba4l | Ukraine policy, though his portfolio had nothing to do with Ukraine. Hill said she had been sufficiently alarmed to report the conversation to her superior and then warn her colleagues to be "very careful" in their communications with Patel. "Let's just say it's a red flag," she testified, "when somebody who you barely know is involved on one of your policy issues" and "clearly providing materials outside of the line"- particularly when she didn't know what those materials were.
ffx8 | Patel has repeatedly denied ever discussing Ukraine with Trump. In his rendering, his colleagues were jealous of his close relationship with the president and still hated him for the Russia investigation. Not only was the deep state's plot against him still in motion, Patel seemed to decide, but it had expanded.
s6su | For the most part, this is how he explains the rest of his time in the Trump administration, why it is that at virtually every turn-from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to the Department of Defense to very nearly the FBI and CIA-there emerges yet another crop of officials who object to his accrual of power. It could not possibly be the case, for example, that Bill Barr harbored genuine concerns about Patel's qualifications to serve as deputy FBI director: In Patel's version of events, Barr was simply one more top bureaucrat bent on foiling Patel's success as payback for the "mess" he'd exposed in their agency. And if this narrative begins to feel less and less plausible, if Patel's latest detractors have to date seemed as reliably pro-Trump as Patel himself-well, that just goes to show their cunning.
y219 | P ATEL HAS A talent for casting himself as the ultimate hero or the unjustly persecuted. I have wondered if this is why he chose not to include in his book the events of October 30, 2020-if, in the end, not even he could figure out a way to make himself the martyr of the story.
06ht | On that Friday, according to multiple reported accounts, SEAL Team 6 was awaiting the Pentagon's green light on a rescue mission in West Africa. The day before, the administration had learned where gunmen were holding Philip Walton, a 27-year-old American who had been kidnapped that week from his farm near Niger's border with Nigeria. As multiple agencies now coordinated on final details for the evening operation, the State Department worked to resolve the last outstanding task-
v3r2 | securing airspace permission from Nigerian officials. Around noon, Patel called the Pentagon with an update: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he said, had gotten the approval. The mission was a go.
nv42 | The SEALs were close to landing in Nigeria when Defense Secretary Mark Esper discovered that the State Department had not, in fact, secured the overflight clearance, as Patel had claimed. The aircraft were quickly diverted, flying in circles for the next hour as officials scrambled to alert the Nigerian government to their position. With the operation window narrowing, Esper and Pompeo called the Situation Room to put the decision to the president: Either they abort the mission and risk their hostage being killed, or they proceed into foreign airspace and risk their soldiers being shot down.
xags | But then, suddenly, the deputy secretary of state was on the line, Esper later wrote in his memoir: They'd been cleared.
jc47 | Soon Walton was reunited with his family.
ko3c | What had happened?
xek3 | Celebratory feelings gave way to anger as officials tried to make sense of Patel's bad report. According to Esper, Pompeo claimed that at no point had he even spoken with Patel about the mission, much less told him he'd received the airspace rights. Esper wrote that his team suspected that Patel had simply "made the approval story up."
bbpr | Anthony Tata, the Pentagon official and retired Army general to whom Patel had originally given the green light, confronted Patel in a rage. "You could've gotten these guys killed!" Tata shouted, according to two people familiar with the exchange. "What the fuck were you thinking?"
5zyf | Patel's response was: "If nobody got hurt, who the fuck cares?"
9own | Patel denies saying this, or making up the approval story. He "would never jeopardize an operation, American hostages or our soldiers," he said through his spokesperson. "In every situation, including this one, I followed the chain of command."
bqfb | But three former senior administration officials independently cited the near catastrophe in West Africa as one of their foremost recollections from Patel's tenure. They remain unsettled by Patel's actions in large part because they still have no clue what motivated them. If Patel had in fact just invented the story, as Esper's team concluded, then why? Was it because the election was in four days, and Patel was simply that impatient to set in motion a final potential victory for Trump, whatever the risk-was it as darkly cynical as that? Did his lack of experience mean he just had no grasp of the consequences?
wwdt | Some people close to the former president privately vent about Patel and whatever they last heard him say on a far-right podcast or at a fundraiser, particularly if it involves some overstatement of his administration activities. The longtime Trump adviser said he had been in Patel's presence, more than once, when he'd claimed he was the person who "gave the order" for U.S. forces to move in and kill the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019-an operation for which Patel, by his own admission, wasn't even in the Situation Room. (Asked about this, Patel said through his spokesperson: "Trump made that brave and courageous call.")
mn1r | One of the former senior administration officials, meanwhile, sent me a photo of what he said was Patel's challenge coin, a small, customizable medallion for service members and government officials. In addition to a curious image of a drone illuminating (targeting?) a dollar sign in front of the White House, the coin features an assortment of national-security-adjacent terms, including DIRECT ACTION, SANCTIONS, HEZ/IRAN, and CYBER. "It's just random shit," the former official said. "Half of this stuff, he wasn't even involved in." (Through the spokesperson, Patel neither confirmed nor denied having such a coin.)
5vqw | Yet the prevailing sentiment in Trump's inner circle, according to the longtime adviser, is that there is no upside to calling out Patel's exaggerations or lies. By now, this person explained, Trump is entrenched in his view of Patel as a "useful tool." The former president, the adviser said, understands that "Kash is the one you say to, 'Hey, I'm not telling you to go break into the DNC. But ... '"
meyw | What Trump might also understand is this: For Patel, the urgency of victory in November is personal. He recently described Trump as the candidate "fighting for everybody else's right to have fame, to have money"-the central prongs of a prosperity that Patel, after nearly a decade in Washington, appears convinced is his due, and of which the leaders of a corrupt system have conspired to deprive him.
2e62 | Little wonder, then, that Steve Bannon mused on his podcast that Patel, far from simply being the person most likely to oversee Trump's retributive plans in a second term, could have helped inspire them in the first place. "I think President Trump might've read Government Gangsters," Bannon said. "Yeah, look, he probably did," Patel responded, fetching a copy to display on camera. "That's probably why it's a best seller, and he keeps talking about it."
75y3 | To the extent that Americans might struggle to grasp what any of this has to do with their own life-how a federal agenda of score-settling corresponds to their ability to be famous and make money-Patel has yet to offer a theory. He tends to frame political vengeance as an end in itself. In a second term, Trump's top law-enforcement and national-security officials would immediately focus on exposing and prosecuting those who "did Russiagate" and are already planning their next "election-rigging scam," he told Bannon-paying special attention, perhaps, to the 60 names in Patel's compendium of "Members of the Executive Branch Deep State," found in Appendix B of Government Gangsters.
s2g2 | And then-well, it's not altogether clear what then. But Patel's value to Trump has never revolved around precise plans. As Richard Nixon's plumbers understood, the hallmark of loyalty is a flexible constitution.
