Reel ª, Smarti Reel ª, Ewan Pearsona, Emanuele Trucco b, Emily Jefferson a,*\nyogo | One. Introduction\n2285 | Digital information is growing rapidly, in terms of five V's (volume, velocity, veracity, variety and value), and hence this is hailed as the big data era. Health-based big data including linked information for patients, such as their clinical data (for example gender, age, pathological and physiological history) and omics data (such as genetics, proteomics and metabolomics) has now become more widely available. Recently, such data has been used for precision (also called personalised or stratified) medicine to provide customised healthcare, i.\nys0g | ABSTRACT\n7zvp | With the development of modern high-throughput omic measurement platforms, it has become essential for biomedical studies to undertake an integrative (combined) approach to fully utilise these data to gain insights into biological systems. Data from various omics sources such as genetics, proteomics, and metabolomics can be integrated to unravel the intricate working of systems biology using machine learning-based predictive algorithms. Machine learning methods offer novel techniques to integrate and analyse the various omics data enabling the discovery of new biomarkers. These biomarkers have the potential to help in accurate disease prediction, patient stratification and delivery of precision medicine. This review paper explores different integrative machine learning methods which have been used to provide an in-depth understanding of biological systems during normal physiological functioning and in the presence of a disease. It provides insight and recommendations for interdisciplinary professionals who envisage employing machine learning skills in multi-omics studies.\nww6u | e. providing a bespoke treatment for individuals. There has been unprecedented growth in the development of precision medicine supported by machine learning approaches and data mining tools. These techniques have also helped to discover novel omics biological markers which can identify the molecular cause of a disease.\nhpi6 | A biomarker is a substance, structure, or process that can be measured in the human body or its products and can provide surrogate information about the presence of a disease or condition.\n4uhb | Molecular biomarkers are discovered by analysing the cascade of information provided by different omics. For example, the high-sensitivity C-Reactive protein test provides an accurate and quantitative risk assessment for cardiovascular disease. Biomarkers play a significant role in planning preventive measures and decisions for patients and can be classified as either diagnostic, prognostic or predictive. Diagnostic biomarkers are used for determining the presence of disease in a patient, while prognostic biomarkers provide information on the overall outcome with or without the standard treatment. Predictive biomarkers are used to identify who is at risk of an outcome. All of these biomarkers can also be used to identify which treatment will be most suitable for a given patient. For example, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study used a combination of neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers to discriminate early Alzheimer's patients from healthy volunteers with an accuracy of ninety-eight percent. Similarly, different forms of Parkinson's syndromes have been investigated by developing an automated tool that fuses multi-site diffusion-weighted MRI imaging biomarkers and disease rating score. Biomarkers can help identify high-risk individuals before their physiological symptoms are evident. Moreover, they also help in measuring disease progression.\nepyi | In the context of precision medicine, machine learning has been used to develop diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tools from single omics data. However, machine learning may have deteriorated performance for certain single omics such as gene data due to inherent characteristics. Machine learning methods are now also being applied to multi-omics data, to investigate and interpret the relationships\ny51p | between data and phenotypes. Although machine learning analysis of multi-omics is still in its embryonic stage, it has already been explored for a wide range of applications, as reported in recent reviews on brain diseases, diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular disease, medical imaging, single-cell analysis in humans and plant science studies. Currently, many of the multi-omic reviews are focused on individual sub-topics. For example, designing studies, setting up workflows, choosing software tools and evaluating overfitted performance.\nx95m | In contrast, this review aims at a broader focus, presenting an interdisciplinary perspective to new readers in this domain by providing a background on multi-omics and machine learning. It takes forward the integration terminologies introduced by Ritchie and summarises the recent integrative state-of-the-art approaches. We aim to cover various integration methods concisely and include a recommendation flowchart enabling interdisciplinary scientists to have a quick head start in this domain.\nyfum | Scope of this review: This review investigates the two primary learning strategies in machine learning, i.e. supervised and unsupervised, which are commonly used within the context of multi-omics integration. This review considers multi-omics integration as a process of combining different single omics. Although various machine learning specialisations such as reinforcement, hybrid, multi-view and self-supervised learning are now emerging in generic healthcare applications, they have not yet gained enough momentum in multi-omics analysis, hence they remain beyond the scope of this review.\nppx4 | Common Reference Recent databases reviews\nqf11 | approach\n```",
