The actions that we will use in the following exercises are designed to allow users to filter all the visualizations to show only the countries that interest them. Then, we'll add a URL action that links to the World Bank's web page for every individual country.\nbc48 | In the dashboard, we have a map that shows every country for which we have data. We have filters for time and other geographic dimensions. Therefore, we have an opportunity to do the following two things with the countries:\nf3v7 | One. We can create a filter action that limits the selections in other worksheets to the countries that a user has selected\n8s6f | Two. We can create a URL action that allows a user to see the World Bank's web page for each country\nx7h9 | The first task involves creating the Filter action that runs when a user selects a country from the map by performing the following steps:\nygmb | One. On the dashboard, click on the Dashboard menu and then click on Actions.\n0o5y | Two. Click on Add Action, and then click on Filter.\ndnu3 | Three. Name the action Filter on Country. It's important to name actions according to their functions so that when you are editing and testing them later, you know where to look first.\ndsty | Chapter Eight\nci0z | The following attributes need to be selected:\nsban | The source of the action, that is, the visualization from which it originates\nhy6w | The action that triggers it\nwlk5 | The fields on which you need to run an action\nais9 | Four. For the source, select the C O two Emissions per Capita sheet on the dashboard.\ncdkq | Five. Run the action on Select. Thus, when a user clicks on a field, its correlated marks in the target sheet will be highlighted. The alternatives are running the action when a user hovers over a mark or showing a hyperlink to run the action when a user rolls over Menu. We will use Menu for the URL action.\najvs | Six. Target all the sheets on the dashboard except for the C O two Emissions per Capita sheet.\nmwef | Seven. Leave the default values to clear the selection. If we had worksheets that we wanted to hide until someone made a selection, which is a great option, we would have excluded all values.\nk8pl | Eight. Next, we need to establish the fields on which we want the filter to run. When a user clicks on a country, the value for that country is used as a filter for other sheets.\n04f6 | In case you left the setting on All Fields, then all the attributes of the mark will be passed as a filter, but only to fields of the same name. For example, if you were going through the values for region and country, then each sheet with those exact same field names and values would be filtered.\n3nhr | Since we have a secondary Data source, specifically the Foreign Aid data, that does not have the same field name for each country (though the values are the same) and has completely different values for the Region field, we need to establish targets.\n4hg2 | Nine. Click on the Selected Fields radio button. Though using specific fields can potentially cause the dashboard to run more slowly with very large data sets, we need to establish the fields on which we need to join the Data sources.\nv0rl | Ten. Click on Add Filter. Since the action is running from a sheet using the World Bank Climate Change data source, it is the default for the source. Pick the Country Name field. Then, for the target, select the same Data source and field. This tells Tableau Public that for sheets that use this Data source, use the Country Name field as both the source and target. Check out the result in the following screenshot:\n8iyl | Eleven. Click on OK.\nasz3 | Twelve. Click on Add filter again. Select the Country Name field again as the source, but for the target, select the Foreign Aid Data sources and then select the Country field as the target.\nsalu | Thirteen. Click on OK.\nv78z | Chapter Eight\nf0em | Fourteen. Check out the action dialog box, which is now complete, as shown in the following screenshot:\nc3sz | Fifteen. You can edit and remove the target filters as required.\nbghr | Sixteen. Click on OK.\nfdud | Seventeen. Back on the dashboard, modify the title above the map so that it says Click on a country to filter as sub-text in twelve point Arial, as shown in the following screenshot:\n8191 | Eighteen. Draw a box around an area of interest on the map. Check out the changes made to other visualizations in the dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot:\nk3he | Chapter Eight\nlze6 | If we were to add additional visualizations to this dashboard, they automatically would become targets of the actions that we have established. For this reason, it's wise to wait until you have added everything of interest to the dashboard before creating actions.\nc1ys | URL actions\n1tyf | URL actions are useful when you wish to connect users to external and auxiliary data, whether it's from a public interest website or to a related dashboard. In the next example, you will create a URL action that allows users to view the World Bank's website for each country.\nktwv | The URL action that you will build will append the name of each country as a variable to the root URL for the World Bank's well-organized websites.\n0yl7 | The root URL is \"http colon double forward slash double-you double-you double-you dot world bank dot org forward slash en forward slash country forward slash,\" and in order to get to a specific country, such as South Africa, you need to add the country name so that it looks like \"http colon double forward slash double-you double-you double-you dot world bank dot org forward slash en forward slash country forward slash southafrica.\"\n8kqn | There is one issue - there are no spaces in the country names in the URL and yet, there are spaces in the country names in the data source.\nct3i | So first, create a Calculated field that removes the space in each Country name so that we can append it as a token to the URL.\ntvep | To remove and append the Country name with a URL, perform the following steps:\ndmvx | One. Go to the Map worksheet and create a Calculated field in the Data source.\n9z6z | Two. Name the Calculated field Country Name.\n4qhr | Three. In the Calculated field, write a formula that uses the Replace function to remove the spaces in the Country field, as shown in the following screenshot. You need to remove the spaces because in the URL, for each country, there are no spaces. Different websites treat spaces differently, depending on their information management strategy and encoding; others might replace spaces with twenty percent:\n3qb9 | Four. Add this field to the Detail shelf on the sheet.\naksw | Five. Note that the percentile table calculation that generates the color for each country no longer seems to work because it was addressing only by Country Name before and it wasn't partitioned (or grouped) by any other values.\np87k | Six. In order to solve this problem, click on the context menu for the field on the Color shelf.\ninmq | Seven. Click on Edit Table Calculation.\nigkq | Eight. In the Running Along drop-down list, select Advanced.\nfy1j | Nine. Click on the Country Name field in the Partitioning pane and then click on the right arrow to move it over to the Addressing pane, as shown in the following screenshot:\nfujm | Ten. Click on OK.\nqq4d | Eleven. Go back to the dashboard. From the Dashboard menu, select Actions.\nma98 | Twelve. Create a new URL action.\nrboa | Thirteen. Name the URL action with the text that will prompt users to perform a specific action, such as Click on Here for Country Data. You want the result to be very obvious because this action will be a Menu action, which means that the name of the action will appear as a call to an action at the bottom of the tooltip, as shown in the following screenshot:\nbdkb | Fourteen. Select C O two Emissions per Capita as the source sheet.\nl47b | Fifteen. Run the action on Menu.\nzio7 | Sixteen. Paste the root URL for the World Bank into the URL box. Then, click on the arrow to the right of the URL box to see a list of fields that you can insert as a variable token.",
