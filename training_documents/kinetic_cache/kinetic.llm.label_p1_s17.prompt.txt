You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dpv6 | INTRODUCTION
8r5j | Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions are ubiquitous and crucial steps in chemical, biological, and catalytic processes. Understanding the mechanistic details of PCET reactions can allow control of these processes. A powerful mechanistic probe is the pH dependence of PCET reaction rates in aqueous solution. For example, a pH- independent apparent rate constant often indicates either a sequential mechanism with rate-limiting electron transfer (ET) or a concerted mechanism with H2O as the proton donor or acceptor." If the apparent rate constant k increases or decreases 10-fold per pH unit, H3O+ or OH are often assumed to be the sole proton donor or acceptor, and a plot of logk versus pH should have a slope of Â±1. However, in several studies, a much weaker pH dependence of the PCET apparent rate constant has been observed. These examples include the homogeneous oxidation of tyrosine13-15 and tryptophan, 16-18 as well as the interfacial reduction of Ru-based water oxidation catalysts."" However, an explanation for these weak pH dependencies remains elusive. Herein, we will show that the weak pH dependence of some PCET reactions can be explained in terms of a competition among multiple mechanisms.

5gui | describe the pH dependence of the apparent standard rate constant for stepwise, electrochemical PCET reactions.20 In this model, the competition between two ET reactions involving the protonated or deprotonated redox species is considered. The resulting pH-dependent standard rate constant has two plateaus at low and high pH limits connected by a V-shape curve. In the intermediate pH region, the rate constant first decreases due to the depletion of the protonated form and then increases due to the growing contribution from the deprotonated form, resulting in the V-shape curve. This model was then generalized by Finklea2 to stepwise multi- proton multi-electron PCET reactions. In addition to the stepwise case, recently, the Surendranath group developed a model that considers the competition between two concerted pathways with different proton donors on a graphitic conjugated catalyst interface. The predicted pH-dependent apparent standard rate constant also has a V-shape, which

All of these models were developed for electrochemical PCET reactions and rely on the Butler-Volmer equation.24,25 Furthermore, Costentin and co- workers developed competing reaction-based pH-dependent models for homogeneous PCET reactions with water as the proton donor or acceptor."2 Their work discussed various cases, such as the competition between concerted pathways with proton transfer within a local water cluster or directly to bulk solvent, the competition between concerted and stepwise pathways, and reactions involving buffer.
t8vv | In this paper, we introduce a general, multichannel kinetic model to describe the pH dependence of homogeneous and heterogeneous PCET. This model yields a general expression for the pH-dependent apparent rate constants of both homogeneous PCET in solution and electrochemical PCET. The core concept of this model is that several ET and PCET channels are accessible and actively contribute to the overall PCET process. The contribution of each channel is strongly influenced by the relative populations of the different forms of the redox species (i.e., protonated or deprotonated and various hydrogen-bonded complexes with the proton donor or acceptor). These populations, described by the mole fractions, are pH-dependent and therefore lead to a complex dependence of the apparent rate constants on pH. Furthermore, we employ this model to describe experimentally measured pH-dependent kinetic data for a representative interfacial electrochemical PCET reaction, namely, reduction of a Ru-based water oxidation catalyst attached to a tin-doped In2O3 (ITO) surface."" Our model explains the origins of the previously observed weak pH dependence of PCET for this system using physically meaningful parameters. Moreover, our model's predicted behavior for a wider pH range is then confirmed by additional experiments. This example highlights the importance of considering all possible reaction channels instead of just the dominant channel when analyzing experimental PCET kinetic data. Although this application focuses on electrochemical PCET, a future study will focus on applications of this kinetic model to homogeneous PCET systems.

kggw | We use the four-channel model shown in Figure 1 as a typical example. Derivations for the general cases are provided in the Supporting Information. In our model, both the oxidized and reduced species can exist in protonated and deprotonated forms: Ox, OxH+, Red", and RedH. These species can be converted to each other via electron transfer (ET) and proton transfer (PT) to or from an external source. The edges of the square diagram in Figure 1 represent sequential ETPT or PTET pathways, and the diagonals of this diagram represent the concerted electron-proton transfer (EPT) pathways.26-29 Herein, the term PCET encompasses both sequential and concerted mechanisms, and the term EPT indicates concerted PCET. Assuming that buffer ions do not participate in the concerted pathways, either a hydronium ion H3O+ or a water molecule can serve as the proton donor for the reduction reaction, and either a water molecule or a hydroxide ion OH can serve as the proton acceptor for the oxidation reaction. If H3O+ or OH is the proton donor or acceptor in the concerted mechanism, the redox species must first form a hydrogen- bonded complex with the ion. These hydrogen-bonded complexes are denoted as {Ox ... H3O+} and {RedH ... OH }. The formation of these complexes is shown with black double

Note that the ET and PT steps involve external electron and proton donors and acceptors that are not shown here.

On the other hand, if water is the proton donor or acceptor in the concerted mechanism, these additional hydrogen bond formation steps are not needed because the complexes with water are already formed upon solvation.
v8uq | Next, we explicitly write the chemical reactions shown in Figure 1. For the remainder of this paper, we use the following convention. For ET, PT, and complex formation reactions, water is considered as a solvent, and the notation {X ... H2O} is dropped. For concerted EPT reactions, the notation {X Â·Â·Â· H2O} must be written explicitly to ensure mass conservation. The ET and EPT channels (half reactions) are characterized by their standard potentials and rate constants, as given by the following expressions
