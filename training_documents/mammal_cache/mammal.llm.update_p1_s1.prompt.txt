You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0w8m | EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY DNA methylation networks underlying mammalian traits
vcu3 | INTRODUCTION: Comparative epigenomics is an emerging field that combines epigenetic signatures with phylogenetic relationships to elucidate species characteristics such as max- imum life span. For this study, we generated cytosine DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles <LATEX>\left( n = 1 5 , 4 5 6 \right)</LATEX> from 348 mammalian species using a methylation array platform that targets highly conserved cytosines.
hjzj | RATIONALE: Nature has evolved mammalian species of greatly differing life spans. To re- solve the relationship of DNAm with maximum
j79f | life span and phylogeny, we performed a large- scale cross-species unsupervised analysis. Com- parative studies in many species enables the identification of epigenetic correlates of max- imum life span and other traits.
6tbv | RESULTS: We first tested whether DNAm levels in highly conserved cytosines captured phylo- genetic relationships among species. We con- structed phyloepigenetic trees that paralleled the traditional phylogeny. To avoid potential confounding by different tissue types, we gen- erated tissue-specific phyloepigenetic trees. The
xb13 | high phyloepigenetic-phylogenetic congru is due to differences in methylation levels is not confounded by sequence conservation.
cxqi | We then interrogated the extent to which DNA methylation associates with specific bio- logical traits. We used an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to iden- tify clusters of highly correlated CpGs (comet- hylation modules). WGCNA identified 55 distinct comethylation modules, of which 30 were sig- nificantly associated with traits including max- imum life span, adult weight, age, sex, human mortality risk, or perturbations that modulate murine life span.
qfmx | Both the epigenome-wide association anal- ysis (EWAS) and eigengene-based analysis iden- tified methylation signatures of maximum life span, and most of these were independent of aging, presumably set at birth, and could be stable predictors of life span at any point in life. Several CpGs that are more highly methylated in long-lived species are located near HOXL sub- class homeoboxes and other genes that play a role in morphogenesis and development. Some of these life span-related CpGs are located next to genes that are also implicated in our analysis of upstream regulators (e.g.,ASCL1 and SMAD6). CpGs with methylation levels that are inverse- ly related to life span are enriched in transcrip- tional start site (TSS1) and promoter flanking (PromF4, PromF5) associated chromatin states. Genes located in chromatin state TSS1 are con- stitutively active and enriched for nucleic acid metabolic processes. This suggests that long-living species evolved mechanisms that maintain low methylation levels in these chromatin states that would favor higher expression levels of genes essential for an organism's survival.
rut3 | The upstream regulator analysis of the EWAS of life span identified the pluripotency tran- scription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Other factors, such as POLII, CTCF, RAD21, <LATEX>Y Y 1 , a n d \quad T A F 1 ,</LATEX> showed the strongest enrich- ment for negatively life span-related CpGs.
m3cp | CONCLUSION: The phyloepigenetic trees indi- cate that divergence of DNA methylation pro- files closely parallels that of genetics through evolution. Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation is subjected to evolutionary pres- sures and selection. The publicly available data from our Mammalian Methylation Consortium are a rich source of information for different fields such as evolutionary biology, develop- mental biology, and aging.

a0a5 | EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY DNA methylation networks underlying mammalian traits
gocl | Using DNA methylation profiles (n = 15,456) from 348 mammalian species, we constructed phyloepigenetic trees that bear marked similarities to traditional phylogenetic ones. Using unsupervised clustering across all samples, we identified 55 distinct cytosine modules, of which 30 are related to traits such as maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, and human mortality risk. Maximum life span is associated with methylation levels in HOXL subclass homeobox genes and developmental processes and is potentially regulated by pluripotency transcription factors. The methylation state of some modules responds to perturbations such as caloric restriction, ablation of growth hormone receptors, consumption of high-fat diets, and expression of Yamanaka factors. This study reveals an intertwined evolution of the genome and epigenome that mediates the biological characteristics and traits of different mammalian species.
ob1z | C omparative epigenomics is a burgeoning field that integrates epigenetic signa- tures with phylogenetic relationships to decipher gene-to-trait functions (1-3). Prior research has investigated the cap-
m4cb | acity of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns in regulatory sequences to reflect evolutionary relationships among species (3, 4). A recent study compared methylation data across multi- ple animal species at orthologous gene promoters
m61y | using a sequencing-based assay that did not specifically target conserved CpGs (4). Previ- ous investigations faced limitations regarding the measurement platform, particularly the low sequencing depth at conserved CpGs and the sample size per species.
u2ob | Our study overcomes these constraints in several ways. First, we used a measurement platform ensuring high effective sequencing depth at conserved CpGs, allowing for a more precise analysis of DNAm patterns in highly conserved DNA regions. Second, we increased the sample size per species, aiming for many samples per species. We profiled 348 species from 25 of the 26 mammalian taxonomic orders. This comprehensive dataset enables examina- tion of phylogenetic relationships, comethyla- tion relationships between cytosines, and their associations with maximum life span and other species characteristics.
2gnm | We profiled 15,456 samples (Fig. 1A and table S1) using a methylation array platform that provides effective sequencing depth at highly conserved CpGs across mammalian spe- cies (5). This dataset is the product of the multinational Mammalian Methylation Con- sortium. In previous studies, we applied super- vised machine learning methods to generate DNAm-based predictors of age called epige- netic clocks for numerous species (6-31).
emgw | Here, we performed a large-scale cross-species unsupervised analysis of the entire dataset to reveal the relationship of DNAm with mam- malian phylogeny. We show that we could construct phyloepigenetic trees that parallel traditional phylogenetic ones. We then pro- ceed to interrogate the extent to which DNAm underpins specific biological traits by using unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to minimize the influence of bias on our observations. This approach iden- tifies modules (clusters) of comethylated CpGs comethylation that are associated with species characteristics, including taxonomy, tissue type, sex, life span, and aging.
