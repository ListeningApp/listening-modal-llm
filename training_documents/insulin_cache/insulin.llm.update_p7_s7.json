        "content": "j30a | Insulin promotes learning of reward associations (such as nutritive value of food) and consequently forms preferences: Flavor-nutrient-preference learning in food-restricted and ad-libitum mice is dependent on insulin receptor activation in the nucleus accumbens. However, it was revealed that in ad libitum-fed mice intra-ventricular insulin does not impair learning of the reward value of a high-fat diet. But, intra-ventricular insulin inhibits reward retrieval indicating an effect on motivation. Finnell and Ferrario systematically investigated the differential effect of intranasal insulin application in the core of the nucleus accumbens on cue-triggered food approach and motivation: while cue-triggered food approach remained unchanged by insulin the motivation to spend effort for food was reduced after insulin application.\n7bdk | For effort spending in progressive ratio tasks, the findings were inconsistent though: While some reported no effect after intra-VTA and intra-NAc insulin application, others found reduced motivation after intra-NAc and intraventricular administration. Findings from intraventricular application have to be interpreted with caution, as the insulin effects cannot be attributed to specific brain areas or neuron populations. Here, insulin can either act directly on DA-circuitry or indirectly through other insulin receptive brain areas (e.g. hypothalamus) that modulate DA-signalling through multisynaptic connections. Moreover, it is important to note that most of the rodent studies used food stimuli to assess reward sensitivity, learning, and motivation. This is simply due to the fact that food stimuli are well-established in rodent assays and are easy to apply. However, some researchers leveraged an intracranial self-stimulation protocol and demonstrated a reward-suppressing effect, indicating that the action of insulin on the brain's DA system has implications far beyond food intake and metabolic regulation. These findings demonstrate conclusively that insulin has a reward-suppressing impact via its action on midbrain DA neurons,\nfim0 | primarily under conditions of satiety. However, more research is required to delineate the receptors and cell subtypes involved and the different forms of rewarding stimuli such as drugs and social and sexual stimuli that are affected.\nojro | Two point five. Impact of insulin on reward behavior in humans\nl6t9 | Recent human research has provided additional evidence for the insulin-mediated downregulation of reward-related processing. In humans, brain function is generally assessed using FMRI, which provides a surrogate marker for neuronal and glial activity through quantifying blood hemoglobin oxygenation. The standard procedure to study central insulin effects in humans is through intranasal insulin application, which enters the nasal mucosa and is transported to the central nervous system via diffusion and trans-neuronal transport via olfactory and trigeminal pathways bypassing the blood-brain barrier. The exact temporal dynamics of insulin's effect on neuronal signalling are unclear, however, there is increasing evidence that the main effect is achieved after thirty minutes in a dose-dependent manner.\n1ujy | Two point five point one. Effect of intranasal insulin on mesocorticolimbic connectivity\nqzor | Studies using FMRI have shown that intranasal insulin reduces not only the ratings of food palatability but also modulates the connectivity between the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens, as well as the functional connectivity between the ventral tegmental area and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings align with several studies that reported alterations in regional activity and connectivity patterns of the reward circuitry after intranasal insulin application. These connectivity changes have been related to peripheral insulin sensitivity and measures of eating behavior. Kullmann and colleagues performed a combined FMRI and PET study using the D two/D three-receptor ligand labeled raclopride and directly assessed brain DA-signalling. They discovered that intranasal insulin decreased DA transmission in the ventral and dorsal striatum. Interestingly, insulin-induced effects in PET imaging were related to functional connectivity changes detected with FMRI forty-five minutes after intranasal insulin intervention indicating that signal alterations, we observe in FMRI are indeed related to DA signalling.\na0by | Two point five point two. Effect of insulin on food preference\nu1ky | It was reported that after an overnight fast, blood insulin levels predicted food preference in insulin-sensitive participants: Higher blood insulin levels were associated with lower food liking. This suppressing effect was also evident after intranasal insulin application. In insulin-resistant participants, this association between food preference and blood insulin as well as central insulin was not detectable. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of intranasal insulin on food preference seems to be sex-dependent: While in normal-weight men, insulin reduced food preference and food intake in the hungry state, this effect was not evident in women neither in pre- nor postmenopausal stage. In contrast, insulin reduced post-prandial snacking and food cravings in women. In line, the neuronal processing of food cues after intranasal insulin application has been demonstrated to depend on body weight and sex.\nhtm9 | Two point five point three. Effect of insulin on motivation\n8hul | The effect of insulin is not limited to food rewards. Glucagon-like peptide one, which has an insulin-enhancing effect, modulates incentive motivation for both food and money. Of course, this effect is not solely attributable to insulin, since glucagon-like peptide one has direct effects on DA neurons. Furthermore, food intake (elevating insulin levels among other factors) has been shown to reduce susceptibility to",
