        "content": "gocl | Consequently, two distinct design modifications were proposed to reduce this probability. The first one was a modification to the Ca value based on and the second one was a modification to the R factor, where a value of four point zero was recommended.\nob1z | In a recent study by Speicher and Harris the seismic performance of six EBFs designed using IBC twenty twelve were assessed based on ASCE forty-one zero six using static and dynamic, linear and nonlinear analyses. The correlation between ASCE seven ten and ASCE forty-one zero six in terms of the anticipated performance level was also studied. Numerical results once again indicated the possibility of concentration of inelastic action in a limited number of links in a properly designed EBF system. In addition, it was observed that the linear assessment methods given in ASCE forty-one zero six are less conservative than the nonlinear assessment procedures. However, it was unclear which of these procedures is more representative of the actual behavior, since the code does not consider the effect of loading history in the assessment process and acceptance criteria. Speicher and Harris mentioned that the responses of links under earthquake loadings were mostly one-sided with a ratcheting approach towards large rotations, and thus, higher rotation capacities might be anticipated for links compared to the codified limits. Consequently, the need for link assessment criteria which are based on cumulative demands was highlighted.\nm4cb | Studies have also been undertaken recently to provide simple relations for estimating the fundamental period as well as the stiffness of EBF systems. In twenty ten, Richards derived a simple relation for predicting the lateral stiffness of an EBF story based on the design story shear, frame geometry, and beam depth. A comprehensive study was conducted in twenty fifteen by Kuşyılmaz and Topkaya to improve the accuracy of the formula available in ASCE seven ten for estimating the fundamental period T of EBFs, which first appeared in UBC eighty-eight and has not been calibrated since then. A hand-method for estimating T was first formulated and its accuracy was demonstrated by comparing the results with data obtained through an extensive parametric study and also with data available in the literature. A simple period-height relation for EBFs was then developed. The results obtained by this expression were compared to the apparent, measured periods of actual EBF buildings, reported by Kwon and Kim, and acceptable conformity was reported. In a similar study, Young and Adeli studied the effect of building irregularities on the fundamental period of\nm61y | EBFs. It was demonstrated that the formula given in ASCE seven ten can yield overly conservative estimates of T for these systems. The results from analyses of twelve properly designed EBFs as well as the data available in the literature were combined to propose a three-variable power expression for predicting T, which included the effects of EBF building irregularities. The study also confirmed that regular EBF buildings tend to have a longer fundamental period compared to EBF buildings with irregularities. The accuracy of the proposed formula was demonstrated using the analytical periods compiled by Tremblay and the apparent periods reported by Kwon and Kim.\nu2ob | The effect of the variability of steel material in the seismic performance of EBFs was studied by Badalassi et al. in twenty thirteen. The numerical results revealed that the variability of the steel material did not have a major effect on the failure probability of the studied structures. In addition, the capacity design requirements of Eurocode eight were found to be appropriate. It is worth mentioning that in some of the studied EBFs by Badalassi et al. two floor beams were used in each level of the EBFs to avoid interaction between the floor deck and the link. The coupled beam sustained the gravity loads while the main beam contained the link and carried the seismic loads. This approach is generally attributed to Perretti.\n2gnm | The seismic reliability of EBFs was investigated recently by Lin et al. by means of nonlinear dynamic analyses, considering far-fault and near-fault earthquakes, based on the guidelines of FEMA three fifty-six. It was concluded that EBFs, particularly low-rise EBFs, have lower failure probabilities than MRFs. The reduction was more pronounced when far-fault ground motions were considered. The behavior of EBFs under near-fault earthquakes was also studied by Eskandari and Vafaei in twenty fifteen. Even though near-fault earthquakes were found to be somewhat more destructive, the probability of low-cycle fatigue-induced premature web fractures were observed to be higher for the case of far-fault ground motions. Nevertheless, it was also concluded that EBFs are suitable systems to be used in near-fault regions owing to the fact that the yp values recorded for all links were in the acceptable range based on FEMA three fifty-six requirements for the life safety performance level.\nemgw | The application of the reduced beam section connection in dual EBFs with long external links was investigated in twenty eleven by Naghipour et al. Results of nonlinear static pushover analyses on four-, seven-, and ten-story dual EBFs revealed that the RBS connection can increase the\nxaqt | ductility of the system by about ten percent and reduce the demand on link-to-column connections by moving the hinge location away from the column face. The RBS connection was however recommended only for long links with shallow sections.\n5rcb | The seismic performance of a special type of EBF, hereafter referred to as HS-EBF, in which links are constructed from conventional steel while other members are made from high strength steels with Fy in excess of three hundred forty-five MPa, was investigated by Lian et al. in twenty fifteen. Results of a cyclic test on a scaled one-story one-bay chevron HS-EBF conducted by these researchers were used to validate their numerical modeling approach. The results of the subsequent analyses under cyclic loading and three ground excitations revealed a general similarity between the performances of HS-EBFs and equivalent conventional EBFs. However, better load carrying capacity and lower material consumption was reported for the HS-EBFs while slightly higher ductility and energy dissipation was indicated for the EBFs. The inter-story drifts and plastic link rotations were also found to be lower in the studied EBFs. Furthermore, a maximum height limit of sixteen stories was recommended for HS-EBFs in order to achieve better seismic performance.\n524j | A number of recent studies have focused on the optimization of EBF systems. In twenty thirteen, Gong et al. presented a genetic algorithm based structural optimization technique for EBFs. A successful application of this optimization method was demonstrated for a hypothetical three-story EBF building; however, this came with the cost of an excessive computational burden of the order of days. In a more recent study, Karami Mohammadi and Sharghi developed an optimum design technique for EBFs based on the concept of uniform deformation theory. These researchers applied the method to three-, five-, and ten-story EBFs and demonstrated that the optimized EBFs have lower weights and better seismic performances compared to those of regularly designed EBFs.\nxd3m | There are also a limited number of studies regarding the effect of concrete slabs on the structural response of EBF systems. In twenty thirteen, Danku et al. investigated the issue in three EBFs and three dual EBFs with four, eight, and twelve stories through nonlinear static pushover analyses as well as IDA considering seven earthquake records. The models were calibrated using the outcomes of a companion experimental study. The numerical results revealed that composite action can increase the system stiffness and reduce the structural drifts and rotation demands on links and lead to a more",
