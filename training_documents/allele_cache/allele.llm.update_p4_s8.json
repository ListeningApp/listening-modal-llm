        "content": "ob1z | We have developed a Bayesian changepoint identification algorithm, which one segments the genomic sequence into regions of the constant BAD using dynamic programming to maximize the marginal likelihood and then two assigns BAD with the maximal posterior to each segment (see \"Methods\"). An additional preprocessing employs distances between neighboring SNVs to exclude long deletions and centromeric regions from BAD estimation. The BAD caller in action is illustrated in Figure two a for two chromosomes using ENCODE K five six two data (see the segmentation map of the complete genome with multiple deletions in Supplementary Figure two).\nm4cb | We performed the BAD calling for two thousand five hundred fifty-six groups of variant calls, where each group consisted of calls obtained from ChIP-Seq alignments for a particular cell type and GEO series or ENCODE biosample ID. In BAD calling, recurrent SNVs sharing dbSNP IDs and found in different data sets within the same group were considered as independent observations. To systematically assess the reliability of the resulting BAD maps, we compared the predicted BADs at all SNVs with the ground truth BADs estimated from COSMIC CNV data for seventy-six matched cell\nm61y | types, with K five six two and MCF seven being the most represented. For K five six two and multiple other cell types, the Kendall tau sub B rank correlation was consistently better for joint data sets with higher numbers of SNVs, which justifies the usage of read counts at SNVs as point measurements of BAD.\nu2ob | Genome structural variations are the most likely yet not the only reason for unbalanced allelic dosage in a particular genomic region. In our case, the agreement of BAD and COSMIC copy-number maps confirms the validity of BAD estimates. However, even suboptimal agreement between a BAD map and the copy-number profile is not a problem as soon as the allelic dosage is estimated correctly.\n2gnm | Particularly, we found that BAD maps of MCF seven agreed poorly with COSMIC independently from the number of SNVs in the data set. To clarify the issue, we processed external deep genomic sequencing data for MCF seven with the ADASTRA pipeline (see \"Methods\"). The resulting BAD map from these data was not dependent on the ChIP procedure but agreed reasonably well with the MCF seven BAD maps from ChIP-enriched data sets, thus validating the ChIP-Seq-based BAD maps for MCF seven cells (see Supplementary Figure two).\nemgw | Of note, the ChIP-independent BAD map for MCF seven still rather poorly agreed with the COSMIC copy numbers markup, SNP-level Kendall tau sub B approximately zero point two, suggesting that for MCF seven the latter is likely an inadequate proxy for the actual BAD. We have no ultimate explanation for this observation but would like to remark that MCF seven was found among the most unstable cell types, which probably leads to discrepancies between exact CNV profiles and BAD estimates for cells originating from different studies.\nxaqt | Additionally, we have analyzed microarray-based CNV estimates for major cell types, including thirteen cell types matching across these data, COSMIC, and our study (Supplementary Figure three). Interestingly, when compared to COSMIC, those data showed a higher correlation for MCF seven rather than for K five six two cells. To a varying degree, such discrepancies can be observed for other cell types. Thus, careless recruitment of copy-number profiles obtained with different methods from different data sources as estimates of BAD may reduce the reliability of called ASBs, the disadvantage that is avoided by using BAD estimates directly from ChIP-Seq data.\n5rcb | As a separate test, we used the predicted BAD maps as multiple binary classifiers for different BAD values using SNP calls across all cell types. With the COSMIC data as the ground truth, we plotted a receiver operating characteristic and a precision-recall curve for each BAD (Figure two c, d). For the most widespread BADs, one to three, covering more than ninety percent of candidate SNVs (Supplementary Figure three), we reached greater than zero point eight three area under curve for ROC and zero point six six to zero point eight five for PRC (Supplementary Table three), proving the reliability of the predicted BAD maps.\n524j | With BAD maps at hand, we segregated the variant calls from all data sets by BAD and by fixed read coverage either at reference or alternative alleles. Then, for each such set of SNVs, we fitted the background distribution as a mixture of two negative binomial distributions with BAD-determined P parameters (see \"Methods\"). ASBs were called independently for the reference (Ref-ASB) and the alternative (Alt-ASB) allele using separately fit background distributions for the fixed read counts at alternative and reference alleles, respectively, thus accounting for general read mapping bias.\nxd3m | Overview of the ADASTRA database. The results of the ASB calling are provided in the ADASTRA database (the database of ADASTRA factor binding sites). In ADASTRA, each dbSNP ID can have several ASB entries for different TFs or cell types. ADASTRA consists of two parts: the first part (TF-ASB, two hundred thirty-three thousand two hundred ninety\n8qb6 | ASBs at one hundred forty-seven thousand nine hundred nine SNPs) contains ASB obtained by aggregation of individual P values for each TF over cell types. The listed ASBs passed multiple testing correction (P less than zero point zero five after Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for the number of tested ASBs). P value estimation, aggregation, and multiple testing correction were performed separately for ASBs with preferred binding to the reference (Ref-ASB) and alternative (Alt-ASB) alleles, and for each TF. The other part of the database (CT-ASB, three hundred fifty-one thousand nine hundred sixty-seven ASBs at two hundred fifty-two thousand four hundred sixty-nine SNPs) contains a similar aggregation of individual ASBs over TFs for each cell type.\nwkbn | TFs and cell types were unequally represented in the source data. Thus, the numbers of the resulting ASB calls were also biased toward most studied cell types and TFs (Figure three a, b), with the top contributions from CTCF for TFs and K five six two for cell types. However, the top eight TFs and top five cell types covered only half of ASB calls (for cell types) or less than a half of ASB calls (for TFs);\nftfg | thus, the produced data on ASB events is diverse across different samples.\n7xi5 | Next, we assessed how ASBs and candidate SNVs are distributed in different genomic regions (Figure three c). Compared to all SNVs and tested candidate ASB sites, the significant ASBs were enriched in enhancers (approximately four times more than expected from the number of SNVs for which there were candidate ASBs, Fisher's exact test P less than ten to the negative three hundred) and promoters (approximately three times more than expected, P less than ten to the negative three hundred). We consider this observation consistent with both the actual location of functional TF-binding sites and deeper coverage of the actual TF-binding regions with ChIP-Seq reads. In fact, ASBs are likely to cluster at the scale of the typical ChIP-Seq peak width, as revealed by the distribution of pairwise distances between SNVs with and without ASBs, which has a bimodal shape (Supplementary Figure four). This effect is likely caused by peak-scale clustering of ChIP-Seq reads allowing for higher\nw8r5 | sensitivity of both SNP calling and ASB calling in the vicinity of ChIP-Seq peak summits.\nybik | and nineteen, respectively. We additionally assembled a reproducible ASB set consisting of two thousand thirty-nine SNPs with ASBs detected in any two of those four ASB sets and found that ADASTRA included one thousand five hundred seventy-three seventy-seven percent of the respective SNPs. Of note, taking pairwise, these four existing ASB data sets also poorly overlap each other (see Supplementary Table four), suggesting that the major fraction of",
