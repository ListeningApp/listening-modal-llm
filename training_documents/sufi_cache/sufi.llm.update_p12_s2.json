        "content": "li84 | And this no can operate in the minds of scientists as strongly as in anyone's.\ny06n | What I am sketchily, inadequately, outlining here is a whole series of blocks and impediments that amount to a mental prison. Well, the Sufis say we live in such a prison, and it is their concern to give us the equipment to free ourselves. We are all conditioned, as we now claim so easily and trippingly; but perhaps being able to say that it is not enough to enable us to see how.\nsipr | If we want to approach the Sufis, their ways of looking at life, at some point it is necessary to swallow the unpalatable fact that they think of us as backward, barbarian, ill-equipped, ill-informed, and primitive, with closed minds in areas where it is vital to our futures that we open them.\nyuxx | Meanwhile, Shah most patiently answers the questions he has been asked, waiting and hoping for questions that are more educated, more sophisticated, based on better information and self-understanding.\ndbah | He gets thousands of letters from everywhere, for he is not a Western more than an Eastern figure, and people from Afghanistan to California ask about the Sufi Way. From these questions and answers he has compiled this book, which is so full of useful viewpoints and information that I cannot do more than draw attention to ideas that may be found profitable starting points.\n4byb | Attention. Shah devotes a full section to it, so important does he consider it, and so indifferent are we to it. In our society we are not taught about attention as a need, as fundamental as food; and we go\nu64j | blundering about, seeking ways to assuage the craving, instead of learning how to provide ourselves with what we need, sensibly and calmly. We feed the hunger blindly, telling ourselves we are seeking God or Love or Service; and we are not taught to recognise the drive in others, and how we are used and manipulated by them. Once the mechanism is brought to our attention and we begin to study it, it is as if a veil had been stripped off ordinary life, and we become freer in our actions, our choices.\n4lha | Knowledge, 'God', as a commodity. Conditioned to the commercial, to having, wanting, trading, buying, selling, we treat everything in this way, including what Shah has to offer. But 'higher knowledge' is not a commodity, to be bought and sold.\nuj4l | The uses of literature. Here Shah is revolutionary. The Sufis know and use dozens of techniques, while we believe there is one. Our teaching in schools and colleges is based on simplistic ideas that take no account of the variations from hour to hour of the human mind. We Westerners demand a standardized product, says Shah: it is what we prize. But the standardized and mass-produced is not what interests him or his associates, who teach individuals, in individual ways.\nojba | The human group - its dynamics. Psychologists are indeed studying this subject, so vital to our society, and to all our associations. Shah has a good deal to contribute; the human group is what the Sufis work with, and their sophistication goes beyond anything we approach.\nmwgi | Emotionalism. Shah does not hesitate to make the claim, infuriating to religionists everywhere, that nearly all we claim as 'religion', as 'higher feelings', as 'mystical experience', is no more than emotionalism. We are taught that there are emotions and intellect, but not that there is something else possible, beyond both and not to be confused with either.\ncjze | Exposing delusions.\nrtvx | Using religions, cults, sects, 'God', to satisfy power drives, the need for togetherness, to provide substitutes for the family, sex.\nh0y1 | How to recognize false teachers and self-appointed Sufis. They proliferate, and delude unfortunate people who could be saved from them by the use of a little logical thought and some common sense.\nxxw0 | Many words and concepts have fallen out of real use. Reading this book, we are forced to recognize that in our scientifically-oriented, materialistic culture, words like humility, pride, greed, love, idolatry, charity, tend to be disposed of into areas labelled 'religion' or 'ethics'. Shah rescues them, strips them of sentiment and vague emotion, and re-introduces them - as tools.\nfv2x | Abjure the why and seek the how, as one Sufi, the explorer Richard Burton, put it. Well, this book is about how we, individually and collectively, may learn to look at ourselves and our institutions differently. And if what we are being taught is unexpected and sometimes disconcerting, then that is in the great tradition too.\n663s | 'Beginning to Begin\n385i | by Idries Shah\nuhr9 | UNTIL only a few years ago, as literary people, psychologists and the increasing number of those engaged in studying human consciousness now so often remind us, Sufism was a closed book for the ordinary person. Its language, in the form found in its classical and technical writings, seemed almost impenetrable. Orientalists (now more correctly renamed Specialists in the Human Sciences in Asia and Africa) maintained a near-monopoly of information on the subject and yet could be found extensively disagreeing as to what Sufism was, how and where it started, and what its teachings meant. Some Islamic workers were against it: others claimed it as the true essence of Islam. Some non-Muslim observers were powerfully attracted to it, others found it too culture-bound for their liking.\n9w2j | The publication of Sufi stories stripped of didactic overlay and much verbiage, together with studies of Sufi psychological work and perhaps above all the observed analogies with current social and cultural concerns, has changed this picture quite dramatically. It is now generally accepted that Sufi research and experience during the past thousand years has been one of the most promising areas of development in the direction of understanding man and indicating his perceptions of extra-dimensional reality. But it was not until people, mainly in the West, began to note the congruence of religious and psychological, esoteric and cultural, thinking that a more holistic approach to the subject could develop.\nusxo | Meanwhile, of course, laggards in science still regard Sufism as mysterious esotericism; cultists still want to preserve this aura; a few scholars wish to produce a monopoly by claiming that their interpretations alone are authoritative; the latter sometimes presenting a spectacle resembling that of the alchemist opposing chemistry because he does not understand it.\n5fmi | The work of displaying the many-sidedness and current relevance of Sufism has not been difficult, given two prerequisites: freedom to publish and a growing dissatisfaction, in many cultures, with hidebound and ignorant authority. All that has been needed has been to quote, from legitimate Sufi sources, including documents, teachings which show the scientific, as well as the religious, interest; to demonstrate, from the same sources, that the psychological insights of the Sufis have proved a source of continuing knowledge which is not inferior to the achievements of modern workers in the field of the mind. In addition, the 'discovery' of the Sufis by several such workers of undeniable importance, and the existence of a living Sufi tradition aside from repetitious cultism and the other deteriorated elements made it rapidly possible - within the span of a decade - for several workers to provide materials which have verified much of the true nature of the Sufi heritage and to confirm its continuing operation.",
