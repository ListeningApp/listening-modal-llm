You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

x972 | 2. Sample descriptions
cwrw | Four basaltic eucrites (Juvinas, Camel Donga, Stannern, and Agoult) with an anomalous basaltic achondrite, Ibitira, were stud- ied in this paper. Of the five, three (Juvinas, Camel Donga, and Stannern) are breccias, and the other two (Agoult and Ibitira) are unbrecciated granulites. Brief descriptions of the meteorites are given in the following subsections. The details are summarized in Table 1.
4i0e | 2.1. Juvinas
h2l3 | Juvinas is known to have fallen in France in 1821. It is com- posed of various igneous clasts, a porous matrix, and recrystal- lized areas (Metzler et al., 1995). According to the metamorphic classification of basaltic eucrites proposed by Takeda and Graham (1991), the chemically equilibrated pyroxenes in Juvinas indicate a thermal metamorphic grade of 5 (1: pristine, 6: most metamor- phosed). Various chronologies of Juvinas exhibit large variations, reflecting its extremely complicated metamorphic history (Table 1). The 207 Pb-206Pb age of its zircons has been reported at ~4560 Ma (Bukovanska and Ireland, 1993) and 4545 ± 15 Ma (Zhou et al., 2013). These values are consistent with the 182Hf-182W isochron age of <LATEX>4 5 4 6 \pm 3 M a</LATEX> for the whole rock and its silicate fractions (anchored by the D'Orbigny angrite; Touboul et al., 2015). Con- versely, the 207 Pb-206Pb isochron of the Juvinas silicates indicates a significantly younger age of <LATEX>4 3 2 0 \pm 1 . 7 M a</LATEX> Lugmair, 1996). Its 40 Ar-39 Ar age was disturbed much <LATEX>l a t e r \quad a t \sim 4 . 0 \quad G a \left( K a - \right.</LATEX> neoka et al., 1995).
dfzb | 2.2. Camel Donga
u6ty | Camel Donga was found in Western Australia in 1984. This me- teorite is a severely metamorphosed polymict breccia (Warren et al., 2017; Ono et al., 2018). Its highly equilibrated pyroxene indi- cates severe thermal metamorphism (Palme et al., 1988; Metzler et al., 1995). A unique characteristic of Camel Donga is its anoma- lously high abundances of secondary metallic Fe (up to 2 wt%), which is thought to be the result of decomposition of initial Fe sulfides and silicates during post-crystallization reheating (Palme et al., 1988; Warren et al., 2017). Mineralogical and chronological studies of Camel Donga also indicate its complicated metamor- phism (Table 1). The Al-Mg short-lived radiometric system in this

pdjh | eucrite recorded early crystallization at 4564.31 +0.98/-3.48 Ma (Hublet et al., 2017). Its zircon 207 Pb/206Pb age is <LATEX>4 5 3 1 \pm 1 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Zhou et al., 2013), resolvably younger than those of the other basaltic eucrites with mean values of 4555 Ma (Misawa et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2013; lizuka et al., 2015). Its oxide 207 Pb-206 Pb age has been determined to be <LATEX>4 5 1 5 . 4 3 \pm 0 . 4 2 M a</LATEX> (lizuka et al., 2019), slightly younger than its zircon age. Meanwhile, its plagio- clase recorded a significantly younger <LATEX>4 0 ^ { 3 9 } A r ^ { 3 9 } A r</LATEX> age of 3750 Ma (Kennedy et al., 2013; Iizuka et al., 2019).
xmgs | 2.3. Stannern
bd9h | Stannern is a monomict brecciated eucrite that fell in the Czech Lands in 1801. Compared to Juvinas and Camel Donga, its pyrox- ene chemistry and textural properties exhibit weak thermal effects, suggesting a metamorphic grade of 4 (Takeda and Graham, 1991; Metzler et al., 1995). Chronological studies of Stannern have re- vealed an old crystallization age of <LATEX>4 5 6 4 \pm 2 M a</LATEX> (Hf-W isochron age; Touboul et al., 2015) and multiple later metamorphic events. Its slightly younger zircon 207 Pb-206Pb age has been reported at 4550 ± 10 Ma (Ireland and Bukovanská, 1992). The U-Pb and K-Ar systems in its silicates were severely disturbed (Tera et al., 1997; Kennedy et al., 2019).
m047 | 2.4. Agoult
gy8c | Agoult is a monomict unbrecciated basaltic eucrite that was found in Morocco in 2000. It is composed of fine-grained gran- ulitic textures with 120° triple junctions, indicating significant re- crystallization (Yamaguchi et al., 2009). Its pyroxenes are chem- ically well equilibrated between homogeneous low-Ca pyroxene and augite. The trace element patterns of this meteorite are simi- lar to those of the Main Group-Nuevo Laredo trend eucrites, even though Agoult is thought to have undergone partial melting dur- ing thermal metamorphism (Yamaguchi et al., 2009). Both U-Pb and K-Ar systems in Agoult have preserved ancient thermal pro- cesses. The 207 Pb-206Pb isochron ages of zircons and oxides in Agoult are dated at <LATEX>4 5 5 4 . 5 \pm 2 . 0</LATEX> Ma and <LATEX>4 5 3 2 . 2 9 \pm 0 . 8 7 M a</LATEX> (Iizuka et al., 2015, 2019), respectively. Its plagioclase presents a young 40 Ar-39 Ar plateau age at <LATEX>4 4 9 4 \pm 9 M a</LATEX> (lizuka et al., 2019). Such chronological variations may be associated with slow cooling.
y4mj | Agoult
vpgq | Iizuka et al. (2019) estimated the cooling rate of the Agoult host rock at 11 ± 2°C/Myr after thermal metamorphism at 4554.5 Ma.
ousl | 2.5. Ibitira
m4ju | Ibitira was found in Brazil in 1957. The mineralogical and chem- ical features of Ibitira are indistinguishable from those of recrystal- lized basaltic eucrites (Yamaguchi et al., 1996). However, its several unique features, such as vesicle-rich textures and alkali element depletions, suggest that Ibitira came from a parent body other than Vesta. The oxygen three-isotopic composition of Ibitira is reported to be <LATEX>\Delta ^ { 1 7 } O = - 0 . 0 7</LATEX> (Scott et al., 2009), significantly higher than the known eucrite fractionation line <LATEX>\left( \Delta ^ { 1 7 } O = - 0 . 2 3 9 \pm 0 . 0 0 7 \% _ { 0 } \right.</LATEX> Greenwood et al., 2005). The pyroxenes in Ibitira were thermally well equilibrated, suggesting a metamorphic grade of 5 (Takeda and Graham, 1991; Miyamoto et al., 2001). Similar to Agoult, the chronologies of Ibitira indicate ancient processes. Short- lived Mn-Cr systems have indicated an <LATEX>a g e \quad o f \quad 4 5 5 6 3 \quad M a \left( L u g - \right.</LATEX> mair and Shukolyukov, 1998). Its identical pyroxene age has been precisely determined at <LATEX>4 5 5 6 . 7 5 \pm 0 . 5 7 M a</LATEX> (Iizuka et al., 2014). Its 40 Ar-39 Ar age has been reported at 4,487 ± 15 Ma (Bogard and Garrison, 1995), which overlaps the ages of some unbrecciated eucrites <LATEX>\left( 4 , 4 8 0 \pm 2 0 M a \right.</LATEX> Bogard and Garrison, 2003).
a0mb | 3. Methods: NanoSIMS U-Pb dating
ki8m | Polished thick sections of the five meteorites were carbon- coated and observed using SEM-EDS and EPMA to locate apatite and/or merrillite minerals with analyzable grain sizes <LATEX>\left( \geq 1 0 \mu m \right)</LATEX> and study their petrological features. After NanoSIMS dating, the major element compositions of these phosphates were analyzed using a JXA-8530F (JEOL) at the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of Tokyo, Japan. The mineral phases of adja- cent silica minerals were also observed following the NanoSIMS analyses using a Raman spectrometer (JASCO NRS-1000) at the Na- tional Institute of Polar Research, Japan. The detailed conditions and results of the observational studies are described in the sup- plementary information.
