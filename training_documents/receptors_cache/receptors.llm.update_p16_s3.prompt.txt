You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

uc9r | Gaq has also been found to play diverse roles in the immune system, where Gaq has been implicated to have a tumor suppressive role. Loss of GNAQ expression enhances both B and T cell proliferation in vivo and survival in vitro115-117. Strikingly, alteration of the Gaq pathway by loss of Gaq expression or recurrent loss of function (LOF) mutations at T96S or Y101, are found in roughly 25% of natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL), a malignant and highly aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma118. Consistent with the impact of Gaq loss in other immune cells, NK-specific knockout of Gaq in mice imparted an intrinsic survival advantage of NK cells as compared to wild type NK cells. Moreover, expression of WT Gaq in Gaq-low NK cell lines promoted apoptosis, which could be ablated by concomitant expression of T96S Gaq suggesting T96S Gaq acts as a dominant negative mutant to promote NK cell tumorigenicity118. The proclivity of R183 and Q209 hotspot mutations in Gaq to solid tumors compared to the incidence of T96 and Y101 in hematopoietic malignancies suggests a complex relationship between the oncogenic or tumor suppressive function of these mutations and the cell context in which they originate, highlighting the complex molecular events underlying Gaq-driven oncogenic signalling.
l0ap | Signalling through Gas in cancer- The GNAS oncogene
x815 | GNAS, encoding the Gas protein, is among the most frequently mutated G proteins in human cancer52. Mutation characterization across tumor types has revealed that GNAS is mutated in ~5% of sequenced tumors, enriched in appendix cancers (70%), pituitary tumors (27%)39. Across TCGA, GNAS is most frequently mutated in endometrial carcinomas (7.3%), stomach adenocarcinomas (5.7%), adrenocortical carcinomas (5.5%), pancreatic adenocarcinomas (5.6%), esophageal carcinomas (4.9%) and colorectal cancers (4.7%) (Table S4). The majority of Gas mutations occur at a hotspot residue (R201), resulting in expression of a constitutively active, GTPase defective form of the Gas protein119. A secondary hotspot can be found at Q227 but is less prevalent than R201 mutants (Figure 2C). The functional significance of the R201 residue was first suggested from studies examining the mechanism of action of cholera toxin. It was revealed that cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates R201 of Gas, irreversibly inhibiting its GTPase
epbj | activity, and resulting in its activation120-122. Crystallographic studies of Gas have since confirmed that the R201 residue lies in its GTP-binding pocket and facilitates GTP hydrolysis 123.
nmn2 | Activation of Gas, either by stimulation of Gas-coupled GPCRs or by activating mutations, stimulates adenylyl cyclases, which leads to the production of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and subsequent signalling events39,124. The tumorigenic effects of Gas were first demonstrated in a subset of growth hormone-secreting pituitary tumors harbouring R201C/H mutations39,125,126. In these tumors, persistent signalling driven by mutant Gas bypassed the canonical requirement for stimulation by growth hormone, resulting in hormone-insensitive growth119. Indeed, the Gas subfamily (GNAS and GNAL) is mutated in nearly 7% of adrenocortical carcinomas in TCGA (Table 1, Table S5). Activation of the Gas pathway has been shown to cause numerous other syndromes with involvement of endocrine dysfunction including McCune-Albright syndrome, which is also characterized by fibrous dysplasia of the bone, in addition to Cushing's syndrome, Carney complex, and micronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia 127-129
g3tm | Strikingly, our recent study found that there is widespread activation of the Gas pathway across a large proportion of cancer types in TCGA with a remarkable enrichment in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract47. Consistent with this, the Gas subfamily is mutated in 5.24% of colorectal, 5.03% of pancreatic and 5.96% of stomach adenocarcinomas (Table 1, Table S5). Indeed, both GNAS and GNAL are significantly mutated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (MutSig2CV q-values = 9.56E-04, and 1.77E-02 respectively) (Table S3). Remarkably, greater than 50% of colorectal cancer patients have aberrant activation of the Gs pathway, including activating mutation or gene amplification of GNAS, or in downstream effectors of Gas including PKA, and adenylyl cyclases, as well as by the activation of prostaglandin E2 receptors (PTGER2, 4), which are coupled to Gs, by inflammatory prostaglandins accumulating locally due to COX2 overexpression (described below)130-132. These genetic alterations and autocrine activation play a central role in the deregulation and activation of the PKA, Wnt and MAPK pathways in the intestinal epithelium and are likely to contribute to tumorigenesis and colorectal cancer progression133-135 (Figure 1).
tfra | Interestingly, many Gas mutant cancers have been found to be highly mucinous. Aligned with this, GNAS expression has been found to induce expression of mucin genes136. In particular, GNAS mutations are highly prevalent in gastrointestinal mucinous neoplasms, including intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, an invasive pancreatic cystic neoplasm that can
5lm9 | advance to pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as appendiceal mucinous tumors where signalling driven by Gas has been found to play a critical role 136-141.
wp2c | Gas, and Gas-driven signalling also plays a critical role in stem cell populations, where it has been found to suppress self-renewal. In contrast to the pro-oncogenic effects of GOF mutations in Gas, in some stem-like cell states, Gas has a tumor suppressive role where LOF mutations, or Gas deletion has been found to drive tumor initiation and progression by de-repression of the Sonic Hedgehog and Hippo pathways142,143. In particular, the loss of GNAS, or low Gas expression is tightly linked to poor overall survival in a subset of aggressive medulloblastomas (MBs) with alterations and activation of SHH signalling, and in neuroblastoma144. Strikingly, deletion of GNAS in neural stem/progenitor cells consistently leads to MB-like tumors in mice by derepressing SHH signalling thus contributing to the development and malignancy of SHH- associated MB tumors144. In epidermal and hair follicle progenitor cell populations, conditional deletion of Gas leads to rapid formation of BCC by repressing PKA-mediated inhibition of SHH and YAP signalling78. Of note, activation of Gas in epithelial stem cells leads to exhaustion of hair follicle stem cells and subsequent hair loss, demonstrating the cell-context specific impact of Gas signalling78.
