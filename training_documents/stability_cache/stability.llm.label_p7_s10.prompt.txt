You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

caos | Although a similar pattern for stability within the inter- nalizing and externalizing subgroups was observed earlier, the homotypic continuity we observe is lower than previ- ously reported [7]. Most notably, a larger number of chil- dren from the internalizing and externalizing subgroups in early or late childhood transitioned to the no problems group over time, suggesting that for many children symptoms of psychopathology during childhood are a transient phase of development. The differences in homotypic continuity might reflect actual differences between the samples used, but are also likely to be partially dependent on the differences in how psychopathology is reported on the CBCL used here and the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) used in earlier work [27]. Whereas the CBCL is a continuous measure of psychopathology, the DAWBA is a structured

pn9j | clinical interview to diagnose psychopathology. Because of our use of continuous measures, the internalizing and externalizing subgroup consists of children with mostly subclinical symptoms. Possibly, homotypic continuity is higher for those with clinical diagnoses than for those with subclinical symptoms. It would thus be interesting to study whether the initial level of symptoms is predictive of the likelihood that children have persistent problems in a sample enriched for children with subclinical and clinical levels of psychopathology.
1pmc | Consistent with earlier literature and the conceptualiza- tion of the DP, we found that the prevalence of the dysregu- lation profile is highest in late childhood, after which there is a decline into adolescence [28]. Regarding the development of DP symptoms, we show that those children who already exhibit internalizing or externalizing symptoms are most likely to transition to the DP. However, similar to earlier work, and in line with decreasing prevalence of DP with age, few children transition to the DP after late childhood. Those who are in the DP in early adolescence largely origi- nated from the externalizing and DP subgroups. Notably, the homotypic continuity of the DP decreases between late childhood and early adolescence. Together with the decrease in prevalence, this implies that, for most individuals, psycho- pathology becomes more clustered within the internalizing or externalizing domain. Despite this decrease in homotypic continuity, our results support the evidence that the DP is an at-risk state for persistent psychopathology, in which the risk of persistence increases with the age at which the DP is exhibited [2, 3, 5]. Where between early and late child- hood, 23% of those children that are in the DP transitioned to the no problems group, only 9% of children in the DP transitioned to the no problems group between late child- hood and early adolescence. Thus, children exhibiting DP symptoms in late childhood are an optimal target for future intervention studies, as those children are likely to benefit most from early treatment.
5z6q | The strengths of our study include the large sample size and the longitudinal design embedded within a population- based cohort. Moreover, using data-driven approaches, namely LPA and LTA, we were able to separately measure psychopathology in a more integrated way, compared to assessing individual traits that are likely correlated. Despite these strengths, this study should be considered in light of some limitations. First, we included parental report of child behavior only, other informants (self-report, teacher report) may provide other valuable insights into the development of childhood psychopathology. Unfortunately, we do not have parallel repeated measures of other informants. Second, at T1, the CBCL version 1.5-5 was used, where for those that were older than 5 years of age at assessment, the CBCL ver- sion 6-18 would have been more appropriate. At the time of data-collection the decision to use the version 1.5-5 was
yeoh | made to maintain consistency with earlier waves of data- collection not included in the current study. Third, at T2, fit indices provided almost equal support for a four and five profile fit (Supplementary Table 2). However, after visual inspection of the profiles that emerged from our LPA with 5 subgroups, the additional subgroup seemed to be a mix of children with internalizing problems and children with the DP (Supplementary Fig. 1). This was further supported by the results that we obtained from rerunning the LTA with 5 profiles at T2. Most children that were included in the additional fifth profile transitioned to either the internalizing subgroup or the DP at T3 (Supplementary Table 7).
b8hf | We present both the prevalence and characteristics of psychopathology subgroups and the stability and change that children exhibit in their behavioral development across childhood and adolescence in a large, longitudinal population-based study. Our findings suggest that for many children, internalizing and externalizing problems can be considered a transient phase of development, but that for externalizing problems the predictive value of persistent problems increases with age. Children classified in the DP in late childhood are much more likely to have psychopa- thology later and the divergence to more specific patterns of psychopathology begins in early adolescence.
hntf | Summary
99fo | In summary, we assessed both the stability and nature of change in symptoms of psychopathology from childhood into early adolescence. Using data-driven methods, latent profile analysis (LPA) and latent transition analysis (LTA), we estimated psychopathology subgroups and the transi- tion probabilities between the different psychopathology subgroups and the no problems subgroup. Similar to earlier work both within our sample and in other samples [6, 7, 13], we identified four behavioral subgroups; including 'no prob- lems' (T1: 85.9%, T2: 79.0%, T3: 78.0%), 'internalizing' (T1: 5.1%, T2: 9.2%, T3: 9.0%), 'externalizing' (T1: 7.3%, T2: 8.3%, T3: 10.2%) and a 'dysregulation' profile (DP) (T1: 1.7%, T2: 3.5%, T3: 2.8%). Many children who were clas- sified in the internalizing and externalizing subgroup tran- sitioned to the no problems subgroup later in development. However, those classified in the DP in late childhood were likely to have persistent psychopathology, with 91.4% being in either the internalizing, externalizing or DP subgroup in early adolescence. This supports evidence that, for some children, internalizing and externalizing problems can be a transient phase of development, whereas the DP is a severe at-risk state for persistent psychopathology.
