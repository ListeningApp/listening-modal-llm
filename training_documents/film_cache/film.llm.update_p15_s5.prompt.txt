You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

8oqt | He begins by noting that the social presence of a woman is different in kind from that of a man. A man's presence depends upon the 'promise of power' which he embodies. This power may be:
6zah | · Moral.
4v5o | · Physical.
ha9e | · Temperamental.
xrnt | · Economic.
c8ra | · Social.
p1l0 | · Sexual.
1i8b | The object of man's power is external to himself - a power which he exerts on others. A woman's presence expresses her own attitude to herself and defines what can and cannot be done to her. Presence to a woman is so intrinsic to her person (as an object of men's actions) that men tend to equate it with her body. To be born a woman is to be born into the keeping of men. We can still see vestiges of this in the traditional Christian wedding ceremony, in which the father, having been asked by the groom for permission to marry his daughter, officially 'gives her away' to the keeping of her husband.
5sfj | A woman must continually watch herself. She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself. From earliest childhood, she has been taught and persuaded to survey herself continually. The surveyor and the surveyed within her are the two constituent elements of her identity as a woman. Her own sense of being in herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated as herself by another. Men survey women before treating them. This determines not only most relations between men and women, but also the relation of women to themselves. To recap:
vk4h | · Men act and women appear.
nsm3 | . Men look at women.
jdfw | · Women watch themselves being looked at.
uc9r | STUDYING FEMINIST FILM THEORY
l0ap | The surveyor of women in herself is male - thus she turns herself into an object - and most particularly an object of vision, a sight. The mirror was often used in Renaissance paintings as a symbol of the vanity of woman. You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her. You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting 'vanity', thus morally condemning the woman for your own pleasure.
x815 | The real function of the painting was otherwise. It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.
epbj | Berger draws a distinction between nakedness and nudity in the European tradition. The nude, he says, is always conventionalised. These conventions derive from a particular tradition of art. What do these conventions mean? What does a nude signify?
nmn2 | To be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognised for oneself. A naked body has to be seen as an object in order to become a nude. Nakedness reveals itself. Nudity is placed on display. To be naked is to be without disguise. To be nude is to have the surface of one's own skin turned into a disguise. Nudity is a form of dress.
g3tm | In the average European oil painting of the nude the principal protagonist is never painted. He is the spectator in front of the picture and he is presumed to be a man. Everything is addressed to him. It is for him that the figures have assumed their nudity. Consider the Allegory of Time and Love by Bronzino (Fig. 1.1).

5lm9 | Venus is depicted kissing cupid. But the way their bodies are arranged has nothing to do with their kissing. Her body is arranged in this way to display it to the man looking at the picture. The picture is made to appeal to his sexuality. It has nothing to do with her sexuality.
wp2c | Sometimes a painting includes a male lover. How then, can we accept Berger's claim that the protagonist is not depicted? Berger argues that almost all post- Renaissance European sexual imagery is frontal - either literally or metaphorically -because the protagonist is the spectator-owner looking at it. Quite often the female is depicted so as to be surveyed by both the man depicted in the painting and by the spectator/owner. The absurdity of this male flattery reached its height in the public art of the nineteenth century.
us5v | Berger does, however, acknowledge that there are a few exceptions to the conventions of the European tradition of oil painting. As an example, Berger suggests we examine Rembrandt's painting of Danäe (Fig. 1.2).
rs2m | The way the painter has painted her includes her will and her intentions in the very structure of the image, in the very expression of her body and face. The image includes her agency, a promise of power that is usually relegated to the domain of the 'masculine'. Because of this, says Berger, the spectator cannot deceive himself into believing that she is naked for him. He cannot turn her into a nude.
uz9y | Today, the attitudes and values that informed that tradition are expressed through the conventions of other more widely diffused media:
8ov0 | STUDYING FEMINIST FILM THEORY
mj9m | · Advertising.
94h3 | · Television.
9jx1 | . Movies.
c3lz | · Music videos.
8bwk | · Pornography.
ez9s | Women are still depicted in quite a different way than men - not because the feminine is different from the masculine - but because the 'ideal' spectator is always assumed to be male.
mqot | Laura Mulvey
oc99 | Laura Mulvey's 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' (first published in 1975) appropriated psychoanalytic theory, particularly that of Freud and Lacan, to demonstrate the ways in which unconscious forces in patriarchal society have structured film form. Drawing on Freud's descriptions of scopophilia, Mulvey argued that this impulse could explain one of the central pleasures of the cinema. Scopophilia had been isolated by Freud as one of the component instincts of sexuality. He associated scopophilia with taking other people as objects, subjecting them to a controlling and curious gaze. Fetishistic scopophilia, says Mulvey, provides an avenue of escape for the male unconscious, which is threatened by the female figure insofar as it represents castration (the absence of a penis). By turning the female figure itself into a fetish, either through over-valuation or possessing her as an object of sight', her appearance becomes reassuring rather than dangerous. The other avenue of escape for the male unconscious, says Mulvey, is voyeurism - investigating the woman, penetrating her privacy, uncovering and demystifying her mystery. This investigation of the woman is counterbalanced by the devaluation, punishment or saving of the guilty object. This voyeuristic impulse has associations with sadism: pleasure lies in ascertaining guilt (immediately associated with castration), asserting control, and subjugating the guilty person to the controlling power of punishing or redeeming authorities.
gipz | Cinematic spectatorship, by its very nature, plays on voyeuristic fantasies. The audience are ensconced in darkness, enhancing their sense of separation from the magic world that unfolds in front of them, indifferent to their presence. The darkness also isolates the spectators from one another. The whole experience creates the illusion of a privileged perspective, from which the spectator can safely look in on a private world, while no one looks back at him.
b4wj | Mulvey identifies three voyeuristic/scopophilic kinds of look associated with the cinema:

yfv2 | . The look between the characters on screen. (Let's call this a diegetic look.]
