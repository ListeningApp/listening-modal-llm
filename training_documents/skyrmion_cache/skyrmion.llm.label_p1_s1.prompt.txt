  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

o2kr | Quantum skyrmion lattices in Heisenberg ferromagnets
v6sk | (Received 2 May 2022; revised 1 September 2022; accepted 2 September 2022; published 17 November 2022)
1wj6 | Skyrmions are topological magnetic textures that can arise in noncentrosymmetric ferromagnetic materials. In most systems experimentally investigated to date, skyrmions emerge as classical objects. However, the discovery of skyrmions with nanometer length scales has sparked interest in their quantum properties. Here, we simulate the ground states of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg lattices with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and discover a broad region in the zero-temperature phase diagram which hosts quantum skyrmion lattices. We argue that the quantum skyrmion lattice phase can be detected experimentally in the magnetization profile via local magnetic polarization measurements as well as in the spin structure factor measurable via neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we explore the resulting quantum skyrmion state, analyze its real-space polarization profile and show that it is a nonclassical state featuring entanglement between quasiparticle and environment mainly localized near the boundary spins of the skyrmion.

06yq | I. INTRODUCTION
dpv6 | Magnetic skyrmions are vortexlike quasiparticles charac- terized by a nontrivial topological invariant in real space [1-4]. These states are typically found in noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets in a certain range of external magnetic field and temperature, and are stabilized by an antisymmetric spin exchange energy, termed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) [1]. After their first detection in a magnetic system by a neutron diffraction experiment in 2009 [5], and a full tomography by electron microscopy in 2010 [6], intense follow-up studies revealed intriguing dynamical properties, rendering skyrmions potentially useful for memory and com- puting devices [7-11]. Usually, the skyrmions encountered in these systems arise from thermal fluctuations and extend over length scales that are much larger than the interatomic distance and thus behave like classical objects. Other possi- bilities to create skyrmions are through suitable de current devices, such as those proposed in Refs. [12,13]. However, smaller skyrmions do exist [14] and have already created interest in possible quantum properties of skyrmions. Several works have predicted the quantum behavior of skyrmions by using classical magnetic textures as a starting point and study- ing quantum corrections in the semiclassical ferromagnetic regime [15-19].
8r5j | Beyond this semiclassical limit, some works have indicated that quantum analogs of classical skyrmions might exist in spin systems. The authors of Ref. [20] used a multiscale

r5il | approach to demonstrate that mesoscopic magnetization vor- tices are stabilized by quantum fluctuations [18,21], which suggests the possibility of inherently quantum-mechanical counterparts of these states at zero temperature. So far, at- tempts to classify skyrmion excitations with sizes comparable to the interatomic spacing have been made in frustrated quan- tum lattice systems [22] and ferromagnetic lattices with DMI [23,24]. Several geometries have been studied to understand the quantum analogs of classical skyrmions, and quantitative results have been obtained by numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian [22-24]. Since the dimension of the quantum Hamiltonian scales exponentially with the number of lattice sites, such exact diagonalization (ED) strategies are limited to small system sizes containing at most ~30 spin-1/2 sites (without exploiting symmetries). Although DMI interactions are among the most popular to investigate the formation of classical skyrmion phases, their quantum analogs are analyt- ically hard to handle and quantitative results beyond system sizes amenable for ED are still lacking. As an alternative route to quantum skyrmions that avoids DMI, frustrated spin lattice systems were studied in Ref. [22]. Using ED for small systems and analytical spin-wave theory, the authors identified skyrmions with magnon bound states and developed a phe- nomenological theory based on a trial wave function.
5gui | Here, we use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm to explore ferromagnetic phases of quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg models with DMI and uni- axial anisotropy. As our main result, we discover a zero- temperature quantum phase with a nontrivial magnetic spin texture that signals an emergent quantum skyrmion lattice. This phase was previously overlooked because it appears only beyond a critical system size which for realistic parameters is larger than the system sizes amenable to ED. We iden- tify three ferromagnetic phases that can be directly observed and distinguished in the space-resolved magnetization pro- file. Furthermore, we argue that the polarization gives access to the zero-temperature phase diagram of the model under

Contrary to similar quasiparticles found in frus- trated lattices [22] or quantum skyrmions embedded in a classical magnet [24], we show that the skyrmion lattice phase reported here emerges from entangled <LATEX>s p i n - 1 / 2</LATEX> pairs, which bear witness to a genuine quantum mechanical origin without classical analog, a feature that may pave the way toward a microscopic description of skyrmion qubits used for realizing quantum logic elements based on nanoscale devices [25].

The notation <LATEX>\langle r , r ^ { \prime } \rangle</LATEX> implies a sum over all pairs of nearest-neighbor lattice sites. In Sec. VI, we will also consider the impact of a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with strength

u6ty | The Hamiltonian (1) may be seen as the quantum coun- terpart of typical classical spin models which give rise to magnetic skyrmions [1-4]. In this work, we discuss the emer- gence of quantum skyrmions and quantum skyrmion lattices in two-dimensional triangular and square lattices at zero tem- perature and with different open boundary shapes (see Fig. 2).

In fact, the reliability of DMRG for 2D spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg models has already been demonstrated in numerous works, with a strong bias toward frustrated antifer- romagnets and spin liquids, which are prime examples of the most demanding systems to simulate numerically due to the presence of topological order and long-range entanglement [27-57]. In this work, we focus on the computationally less demanding scenario of magnetically ordered phases hosting skyrmions and field-polarized (FP) states in the ferromagnetic regime
