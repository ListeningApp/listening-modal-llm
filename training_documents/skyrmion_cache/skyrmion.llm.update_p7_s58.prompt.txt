You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

6d4s | Regarding alternative numerical schemes, we have verified that our MPS results agree quantitatively with all available results from exact diagonalization. We have also compared our results to variational methods based on neural-network quantum states. However, we found significant deviations between the exact result and neural-network states even for small system sizes, and the error was already on the or- der of 10% for the energy eigenvalues. This suggests that neural-network states may not provide an efficient variational ansatz for mesoscopic spin systems with DMI. We expect that quantum Monte-Carlo simulations might be useful to go to larger system sizes. However, the inclusion of DMI together with an external magnetic field brings about a sign problem that hinders convergence. Other promising tensor network states for 2D spin systems with DMI are variational tree
mqah | tensor network states [62] and projected entangled pair states (PEPS) [63]. We expect finite PEPS to outperform MPS for larger spin-1/2 systems hosting skyrmion lattices, especially since recently a more efficient gradient-based optimization has been developed based on automatic differentiation tech- niques [57,64,65].
xxr8 | APPENDIX A: MATRIX PRODUCT STATES
rl4j | Tensor networks provide an important numerical toolbox in computational physics and have been applied success- fully to countless interacting and strongly correlated systems [66-69]. One of the most established algorithms, called DMRG [70-72], is understood as a sequential variational optimization of adjacent MPS tensors until convergence is reached. Our DMRG simulations are mainly based on the Ju- lia package ITensors [73], and we made available a condensed version, reproducing Fig. 2(e), on GitHub [26]. Addition- ally, we cross-checked ITensor with TeNPy simulations [74], and upload the condensed version for the TeNPy framework alongside the julia implementation [26].

For a finite system with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the objects A,in) are matrices, except for the two boundary vectors A(11) and A IN) N, such that the result of the product is a scalar. The dimension of the matrices M = maxn dim (A(in)) is called the bond dimension. If M is fixed to an arbitrary integer, then the MPS representation of quantum states can be used as a variational ansatz to approximate the minimum energy eigenstate. The quality of this approxima- tion is controlled by M. This is particularly transparent in the so-called Schmidt decomposition |$) = Li-1 Si IVA,i) IVB,i) in which A and B denotes an arbitrary bipartition of the sys- tem and |Va,i) E Ha forms a complete basis in the Hilbert space of the part & E {A, B}. The Schmidt values si are the roots of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix, and therefore related to the von Neumann entanglement entropy S = - X4-1 |sil2 In(|sil2). Consider a truncation M < M, then states with a small weight in the reduced density matrix are neglected, and the overlap between the original state with bond dimension M is reduced.
awab | Similarly to quantum states having an MPS representation, quantum operators have a matrix product operator (MPO) rep- resentation. Let ME be the bond dimension of the Hamiltonian MPO, then the standard DMRG algorithm bears a leading nu- merical complexity of O(M3 MH) (assuming that MH < M2).
ixcc | For generic many-body states rewritten as MPS, M is an extensive quantity in the number of sites and diverges in the thermodynamic limit. If the target state of a one-dimensional system obeys an area law of the quantum entanglement, then the von Neumann entropy is guaranteed to be a finite constant [75]. Consequentially, M remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, and MPS becomes exact, which explains the success of DMRG applied to one-dimensional quantum systems. De- spite its limitations in two dimensions, DMRG is frequently applied to ladder systems and can even yield reliable re- sults for strongly correlated lattices, especially in the case of

pmgl | quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg models. We expect MPS to reliably capture the physics of the quantum skyrmion lattice phase because the external field polarizes the environment, and the resulting states carry no entanglement in the paramag- netic regions, but localized entanglement around the domain wall of the skyrmion.
90no | We typically start with random MPS initial states of bond dimensions up to <LATEX>M \leq 1 0 2 4 ,</LATEX> followed by sequential vari- ational optimizations ("sweeping") of two adjacent tensors (two-site DMRG). The two-site DMRG allows us to estimate the truncation error <LATEX>\Delta \rho = \sum _ { i = M + 1 } ^ { \infty } s _ { i } ^ { 2 } ,</LATEX> which we use in Fig. 10 to extrapolate toward results without numerical errors. To ensure that we display converged results only, we carefully monitor local spin expectation values and stop the simulation if changes in the observables become smaller than <LATEX>\delta = 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } .</LATEX> Since we use DMRG in two spatial dimensions, convergence to a spin spiral state may require many sweeps, on the order of 100-1000. The quality of the approximate ground state with energy <LATEX>E \left( M \right) = \langle \psi \left( M \right) | \widehat { H } | \psi \left( \widetilde { M } \right) \rangle</LATEX> can be estimated by the energy variance
