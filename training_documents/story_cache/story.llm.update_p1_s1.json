On stories and narratives\nwcd0 | Two\ncaos | The narrative approach\nqrvy | Three\npn9j | Steps to narrative analysis\n1pmc | Four\n5z6q | Let's practice! (small groups)\nyeoh | IS THERE A DIFFERENCE?\nb8hf | · Account\nhntf | · Experience\n99fo | · Story\ny5r7 | · Narrative\nlrry | NARRATIVE APPROACH\nhvhm | Assumptions:\n863b | One. People create meaning through narratives. Making sense of the world through narratives or stories.\nfj24 | Two. Meaning is constructed in historical, social, cultural, and political contexts.\nuz3c | Three. There is no \"truth\", only interpretations of \"reality\". Subjective construction.\nd5bi | Four. Narratives shape one's self-concept and identity. The stories people tell about themselves reflect their beliefs, values, and personal history, contributing to the formation of a coherent sense of self.\nba4l | THEREFORE:\nffx8 | One. Content is important.\ns6su | Words\ny219 | Themes\n06ht | Plot\nv3r2 | Structure or Temporality\nnv42 | Two.\nxags | Dialogic or performative\njc47 | LIFE STORY INTERVIEW Considerations:\nko3c | · Structured - set of questions\nxek3 | · Unstructured - one question or theme\nbbpr | · Written stories - participant writing their own narratives\n5zyf | · Conversational or dialogue - informal, no specific structure, researcher as part of the process.\n9own | · Observations\nbqfb | · Recording\nwwdt | · Venue and Time\nmn1r | · Ethical aspects\n5vqw | NARRATIVE ANALYSIS\nmeyw | An approach taken to interview data that is concerned with understanding how and why people talk about their lives as a story or a series of stories. This inevitably includes issues of identity and the interaction between the narrator and audience or audiences.\n2e62 | STEPS:\n75y3 | FRAMING THE ANALYTICAL PROCESS\ns2g2 | Clearly define the objective of your analysis. Decide what aspect of the narratives you want to explore and what insights you hope to gain.\nq1q2 | COLLECT THE NARRATIVE or NARRATIVES\ncb7r | Decide on how you would collect the narratives or stories.\n68xu | FAMILIARIZATION\nhd35 | Read or listen to the narratives multiple times to become familiar with the content and context. Take notes on key themes, emotions, patterns, and any initial impressions.\n2zpk | CODING\nepu7 | Identify and code meaningful units within the narratives. Codes are labels or categories that capture recurring themes, emotions, events, or elements of the stories. Read references, review related literature (make sure codes are justifiable!).\n7od1 | STEPS:\n0bqy | THEME DEVELOPMENT\nb780 | Analyze the coded data within each category to identify overarching themes. These themes could represent recurring patterns, ideas, emotions, or experiences that are present in the narratives.\nccmb | NARRATIVE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS\nma93 | Pay attention to the structure of the narratives, including the way events are sequenced, the use of chronology, temporal shifts, and the inclusion of reflective elements. This can provide insights into how individuals construct their stories.\nc6hh | CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS\ny7ea | Consider the cultural, social, historical, and personal contexts in which the narratives were created. These contexts can influence the way narratives are constructed and interpreted.\nnav4 | INTERPRETATION AND MEANING-MAKING\ngem8 | Reflect on the meanings conveyed in the narratives. Consider how individuals use storytelling to make sense of their experiences, emotions, and identities. Interpret the underlying messages and values present in the stories.\ne8nr | STEPS:\nk78w | GENERATING FINDINGS\ng9du | Summarize your findings in a coherent and organized manner. Present the main themes, insights, and interpretations that emerged from the analysis.\nf682 | REFLEXIVITY\nli1k | Reflect on your own biases, assumptions, and perspectives that might have influenced the analysis. This reflexivity helps ensure the validity and credibility of your findings.\npbea | ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nccpt | Throughout the analysis process, ensure ethical treatment of the narratives and the individuals who shared them. Protect confidentiality, respect privacy, and accurately represent the narratives.\n0fpw | REPORT WRITING\ndqn8 | Write a comprehensive report detailing your narrative analysis process, findings, and interpretations. Include relevant excerpts from the narratives to support your points.\ncop0 | LET'S PRACTICE!\nlhkq | QUESTIONS?\n82ju | THANKS!",
