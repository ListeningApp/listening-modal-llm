You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | This publication, 'Introduction to Security Management', is designed primarily to provide students with the necessary study material in preparation for one of the mandatory modules forming part of the Security Institute's assessment in Security Management at Certificate level and on which detail it is based.
1wj6 | Students and security practitioners are recommended to read additional publications, including statutes, as appropriate on these subjects to achieve greater understanding. However, it must be clearly understood that all assessment questions for the module will be based on the contents of this particular publication unless otherwise directed.
936l | The content of this publication, together with the other module publications - shown below - are considered to be an indispensable source of reference and practical guidance to any professionally motivated security manager.
06yq | The full range of publications in this series and relative to the modules of the same name that comprise the SyI Certificate in Security Management are shown below. The Guides are available either separately, or as part of a comprehensive Security Management Compendium. The actual award of the Certificate requires students to undertake study and pass assessment in the three mandatory modules as well as three elective modules.

xrd1 | 1 Introduction to Security and Risk Management
5746 | In a hundred years' time, when the history of the 21st century comes to be written, the first decade of the century may well be called 'The Age of Security'. Although security has been a fundamental consideration since the beginning of human history, security has come to play an increasingly central role in all aspects of our lives in the recent past. This has affected, amongst other things, the way we live, how we travel, how we communicate and the way we move money around.
7toz | The role of the modern security manager has also had to adapt to the emergence of new threats and challenges. The traditional role of the security manager was often seen as being limited to ensuring that windows and doors were locked, and preventing goods from being stolen. However, the modern security manager faces a wider range of tasks and challenges. It is not uncommon for security managers to be called upon to deal with situations involving terrorism, cyber-security, crisis management and the personal protection of senior executives, as well as more traditional tasks around physical security (fences, lighting, locks, CCTV, access control systems, alarm monitoring and control room design).
j346 | 1. As well as that, the modern security manager also faces the need to operate in a tight financial environment. Unfortunately, security is often seen as a 'non-productive cost', and security managers need to fight their corner at Board room level to ensure that their assets, personnel and budget are fit for purpose.
v8uq | 2. However, whilst the security manager faces increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the world, there are also increased opportunities. It was not so long ago that the corporate security manager (who in those days would invariably be a man) would be a retired police officer who found work through the "Old Boys" network, and who mainly saw the work he was doing as an extension of their police activities. The modern security manager, however, is expected to be able to demonstrate the same level of professional development and technical excellence as any other senior expert in the company.
x972 | 3. The purpose of this programme is to ensure that, wherever you are in your security career, you will develop a full understanding of all of the major issues in modern security management. Whatever your present level of operation or future aspirations may be, this programme is designed to give you the basic framework that will allow you to understand how the various components of modern security management fit together. All of the Modules can be approached as stand-alone subjects, but just as in security itself, you will find that many of them use the same basic concepts of security management, and there may be areas where the language and concepts overlap.

4i0e | 2 Security, Freedom, Threat: The Three Basic Concepts of Security Management
h2l3 | The Great Wall of China and Castle Moats show that security is something that has always been at the forefront of human social management (see Figure 1 below).
dfzb | Figure 1: Classical Security Systems
u6ty | If we want to find an all-encompassing definition of security, one that would be valid under any circumstances, it would be something along the lines of: 'The purpose of security is to create a safe environment where routine activities can be carried out in as normal a way as possible, in accordance with the perceived level of threat'. By using this definition, we are introducing the three basic concepts that are the foundation of all security management programmes, namely:
awvu | . Security
on9b | · Freedom of Action
a8ge | . Threat
h27a | These concepts apply whether you are locking your bicycle to a railing, putting defensive fencing around a nuclear power station, protecting a VIP or using an access control system into a multi-usage commercial building. The first two concepts, Security and Freedom, are inseparably linked. If you want more security, you will pay for that in freedom (see figure 2). If you decide you need to have more freedom (for example to move in and out of a building without showing a pass, to use a private laptop in the workplace, or to allow cars to park near your building), then that will inevitably mean that you will have a lower level of security than if those things had not been allowed.
pdjh | Figure 2: Linkage between 'Security' and 'Freedom'
xmgs | Security and Freedom are inversely linked. The greater the security, the less freedom, and conversely, the more freedom, the less security.
bd9h | Therefore, the question that all security managers need to address is 'How much security do I need?' In order to answer this seemingly simple question, we have to ask another question in return: 'What is the threat?' Unless
m047 | 5
gy8c | we have an understanding of what is the level of threat, we have no way of assessing what level of security would be considered appropriate (see figure 3).
y4mj | Figure 3: The Security Management Triangle: Security, Freedom and Threat
vpgq | The appropriate balance between Security and Freedom can only happen once we have assessed the level of Threat.
ousl | Airport security checks are an excellent example of this principle. The perceived high risk of attacks against airlines has led to governments across the world increasing the levels of security at airports. However, this has had direct impact on our freedom, for example we cannot take liquids and other material onto planes, and / or we have to undergo what might be considered as intrusive security checks, including removing belts and shoes and, more controversially, undergoing full-body x-rays.
m4ju | Given the potential impact of a successful terrorist attack, it is not surprising that there have been fierce debates concerning the correct balance between security and personal freedom. Arguments made in 2006, following the attempt to use 'chemical bombs' on ten airliners travelling from UK to United States and Canada saw politicians, who wanted to introduce laws such as identity cards and extended periods of detention with arrest for suspected terrorists, clash with judges, who felt that these new rules were outside the normal British legal system, and disproportionate to the actual level of threat. UK Home Secretary John Reid made a speech that stated that Britain was 'now facing the most sustained period of sustained threat since the end of the second world war' (2006). Reid went on to state that critics of the government anti-terror legislation were putting national security at risk. The Court of Appeal disagreed with this, and stated that there was no justification for the declaration of a state of public emergency, and that therefore 'Terrorist violence, serious as it is, does not threaten our institutions of government or our existence as a civil community'. In the same judgement, Lord Hoffman, made his famous announcement that 'The real threat to the life of the nation . . . comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these' (2004).
a0mb | As a security manager, one of your fundamental roles will be to assess the actual level of threat, and strike the appropriate balance between the freedom required by your organisation and personnel to carry out their normal duties, whilst monitoring or controlling those activities in order to ensure the right level of security cover is provided.
ki8m | 3 Risk Management Strategies
km8w | Although the overriding objective of Security Management could be encapsulated in the slogan 'Reduce Risk, Increase Safety', deciding which is the most appropriate approach is dependent on a wide range of factors, including the operating environment, organisational risk culture, resources, management support , potential loss and other (competing) strategic objectives. For example, it may be part of the company's strategic objectives to develop operations in new markets in Eastern Europe or Africa. There would obviously be a risk associated with these moves that would not be applicable in working in a UK or a developed western European market such as Zurich or Hamburg. However, it may be that these additional risks may be considered as acceptable by the company's management within the context of the business development project, and it would be the responsibility of the security manager to develop an appropriate strategy to manage those risks in line with the company's wider strategic objectives.
wzno | Given that it is impossible to completely eliminate risk altogether, there comes a time when there must be an acceptance of a certain level of risk - or at least, uncertainty. In order to keep risk management relevant to situations in the real world, there is a recognised concept of 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable' (ALARP). This means that whilst we have a responsibility to both identify and manage risk, we cannot be expected to try and eliminate every single conceivable risk, however low its possibility might be.
xagm | There are a number of ways that potential risk management strategies can be categorised, though most models generally consist of between four and six different approaches. Here are five of the most widely accepted options. As you work through the study course, you will recognise these as coming up time and again within different security management contexts.
iwn5 | Avoid
uooz | This is done by acknowledging the risk, and changing your own activities in order to avoid the possibility of an incident occurring. Examples might include not moving into new markets in the example above, banning the use of personal computers in order to minimise the possibility of an electronic virus contaminating the company computer system, or keeping visitors to a production facility restricted to certain areas, in order to avoid industrial espionage or potential accidents.
pxbq | Reduce This is done by introducing protocols to minimise the possibility of an unwanted event happening, and to minimise the impact of any unwanted event that does happen. For example, if a company had lone workers who were visiting outside sites, and had identified that as a potential risk, requiring them to log their movements ahead of time with the HR or security department, and then calling in both before and after the visit would limit the potential harm if something did happen (by allowing the HR or security team to become aware of the situation at the earliest possible moment). Similarly, introducing a 'Meet & Greet' process at the front gate reduces the risk of potentially unwanted visitors gaining access to a building.
jfsr | Share Many of the risk management strategies that have been accepted within the wider security management framework originally started in Supply Chain Management. It is a feature of SCM that each player is dependent on the link before them in the chain, so that the final 'customer' who is waiting delivery of the vital piece of stock is relatively powerless to control that process. The concept of sharing the risk is actually more concerned with sharing potential loss. Under this system, each person would face financial penalties if they did not deliver according to agreed terms. Within a wider security management context, sharing risk can be seen as a way of minimising potential liabilities.
u15r | Transfer
lq35 | An example of risk transfer that would be familiar to most people is insurance, where the payment of a relatively small fee transfers the risk of the cost of a potential incident to the third party, in this case the insurance company. By transferring risk, you are in effect outsourcing the responsibility for the management of the risk, and any possible consequences. The retention of a specialist crisis management agency to handle crisis situations overseas is an example of sharing the potential liability for emergency evacuations, in a situation where it would be irresponsible to ignore the potential risk, but unfeasible to manage it in-house. Another example would be the decision as to whether to use a car-leasing company for the company fleet, or to own the cars outright. By using a fleet-hire system, the management of the risks - breakdowns, accidents, servicing, etc - is transferred to the leasing company. One advantage of this system is that there is
3g9w | a clearly defined cost to this particular option - the fee you pay to the agency for the service that they provide.
d09o | There are two reasons for retaining risk. One is because the potential likelihood or potential impact is so low as be deemed acceptable - the 'We will deal with it if it happens' approach. This is actually a very effective means of dealing with low-level risks, as long as the potential consequences of such risks are well understood, and there are clear protocols in place for dealing with them. For example, if in the example above the company decides to own their own cars rather than lease them, then the risks associated with that decision would be accepted as part of the greater risk management process, but there would also be clearly defined protocols in place for when those situations did occur.
ylhz | Retain
a3td | The other reason for retaining risk is if there is no feasible way of managing it though any of the other strategies listed. For example, the risk of an executive being kidnapped is one that would need to be managed if they were working in Somalia or Sudan, where such risks are a realistic part of operating in that region, but would not necessarily be part of the risk management strategy in New York or Zurich. It may be decided that the low likelihood of such an incident occurring there outweighs the prohibitive cost of insuring against such a situation.
ex5k | 3.1 Summary
9d4o | Modern security management has grown beyond traditional concepts of merely protecting property, services and personnel. The range of present-day risks is creating challenges that require a fully integrated and professional approach to security management that is on par with every other aspect of an organisation's operation management. The modern security manager needs to have a strong understanding of the underlying principles that create the foundation for effective security management, and this programme will introduce those principles in a structured way over coming modules.
cjq2 | In summary:
5esx | . Security Management is always a balance between Freedom and Security
m5ka | . Appropriate levels of security can only be discussed in terms of the perceived Risk / Threat
byu8 | . There is no such thing as total elimination of Risk, the best we can aim for is 'As Low As Reasonably Practicable'
76b0 | . Major RM strategies include Avoid, Reduce, Share, Transfer, Retain
zxz6 | 3.2 Self-assessment exercises
xnth | Self-assessment 1: Choose an organisation, and outline some of the main functions and responsibilities of the Security Manager within that particular risk environment
vafm | Self-assessment 2: Give an example of three situations where a change in the level of Risk Perception has caused a change in the level of security control (for example, being searched at a nightclub, having to show ID to get into an Embassy, having to wear a student ID card to get access to campus buildings).
2zmw | Self-assessment 3: Take one of the examples, and discuss whether, given the perceived level of threat, you think that they have got an appropriate balance between security and freedom, and why you think they have made that decision.
bf9k | Self-assessment 4: Give an example of each of the five security management strategies listed above, and show how the appropriate use of each can add to the overall security of an organisation or operation.
otkr | 4 Risk Management
ibgs | For any security manager, whatever their role and whatever the size of operation that they are responsible for, there are three fundamental issues that they will be dealing with, and it is likely that the vast majority of their daily work can be clearly classified as belonging in one of those three categories:
