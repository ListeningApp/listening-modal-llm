I want to show you the difference between convergent and divergent problem solving. Why? So that you can actually create the Grand Slam Offer that will become the cornerstones of your business.\ntyl7 | Convergent and Divergent Thinking\n2hpu | In simple terms, convergent problem solving is where you take lots of variables, all known, with unchanging conditions and converge on a singular answer. Think math.\na10k | Example:\n2pp5 | You have three salespeople who can each take one hundred calls per month each.\nl20h | It takes four calls to create one sale (including no shows).\nkfwj | You need to get to one hundred ten sales...\n7hi1 | How many sales people must you hire? Deduced Information:\nvpa2 | One hundred calls divided by four calls per close equals twenty-five Closes Per one hundred Calls\nmtlg | Twenty-five closes per rep\n6rz3 | Goal: one hundred ten sales total divided by twenty-five sales per rep equals four point four\noxdb | Since you can't hire four point four reps, you decide you must have five.\nv978 | ANSWER: And since you have three, you hire two more.\nuqzw | Math problems are convergent. There are lots of variables and a single answer. We are taught all our lives in school to think this way. That is because it's easy to grade.\n56yl | But life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem. Not only that, convergent answers are binary. They are either right or they are wrong. With divergent thinking, you can have multiple right answers, and one answer that is way more right than the others. Cool right?\nr00c | Here's what life presents us for divergent thinking: Multiple Variables, Known and Unknown, Dynamic Conditions, Multiple Answers.\nbhhp | As such, I want to do an exercise with you that will engage the part of your brain that you will need to use in order to make something magical.\nbyke | I call it the \"brick\" exercise. Don't worry, it'll only take one hundred twenty seconds.\nz2w8 | The Brick Exercise\n1l0m | Right now, I want you to set a timer on your phone for one hundred twenty seconds. What you need to do: Think of a brick. Write down as many different uses of a brick as you can possibly think of. How many different ways could a brick be used in life to provide value.\n9ctx | Ready? Go. It's okay to write in the book.\nyipb | Alright - stop. Now before I show you my list, did you consider the following...\na9dp | ...How big is the brick? A tab of gum, three by five-eighths by two by one-quarter by eight (Standard), two ft by two ft by six ft? What is the brick made of? Plastic, Gold, Clay, Wood, Metal?...\nzso4 | ...How is the brick shaped? Does it have holes in it? Does it have divots for interlocking?\n4g5b | Now as you think about that, can you think of even more uses for the brick than you probably wrote down? Here's my list:\nddml | · Paper weight\nahtn | · Door stop\n5jda | · Building things\nq1jc | · Home for a fish in a fish bowl\nke6a | · Plant holder with dirt in the holes (holed brick)\nc4gy | · As a trophy (painted brick)\nlr9x | · Rustic decoration\njux5 | · To break window\nbe8m | · Make a mural (tiny bricks painted)\n1lxd | · A weight for resistance training\nz3ff | · A wedge under uneven platform\nrv0j | · Pen holder (holed brick)\nkv4p | · Children's toy (lego bricks)\ng1v3 | · Floatation device (plastic brick)\n7d2w | · Payment for goods (gold brick)\n3b38 | · Stabilizer for leaning something against\nil0a | · Retainer of value (gold brick)\nmato | · Holder for flagpole (holed brick)\nuas3 | · A seat (jumbo brick)\n6hc3 | Every offer has building blocks, the pieces that when combined make an offer irresistible. Our goal is to use a divergent thought process to think of as many easy ways to combine these elements to provide value.\nrkb7 | So if I were selling a brick, I would find out what my customer's desire was, and then devise how many ways I could create value with my \"brick.\"\neu28 | Now let's do it for real.\nbes8 | VALUE OFFER: CREATING YOUR GRAND SLAM OFFER PART ONE: PROBLEMS and SOLUTIONS\nqlbn | MICHAEL JACKSON, \"ABC\"\nmnni | LIST ALL\nqvk0 | ONE DREAM OUTCOME?\nyoge | THREE PROBLEMS AS SOLUTIONS\nwb8y | TWO PROBLEMS / OBSTACLES\nwkvi | X\nvo68 | >\n1329 | - >\nd26s | X\n52b2 | *\nrvlv | FOUR MAXIMIZE PROFIT / VALUE\nvfsg | FIVE FINAL HIGH VALUE HIGH PROFIT OFFER STACK\nxbmv | ONE VALUE and COST V\n8dfo | V VALUE TCOST X\nlz3e | ONE VALUE ONE COST V\ny26m | ONE VALUE and COST V\nj0ou | - VALUE and COST X\nzk07 | ONE VALUE ONE COST V\n0lr7 | ONE VALUE and COST V\nudsn | ONE\n6tgb | ONE VALUE and COST V\n7fxo | ONE VALUE ONE COST\nnzpg | ONE\nkou3 | ONE\nq8mn | ONE VALUE ONE COST V\n2n9u | When I started my gym, I struggled. I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something. But try as I did, I couldn't even sell people into a ninety-nine dollars per month bootcamp. People would say, \"L A Fitness is twenty-nine dollars per month. This is expensive.\" I even tried getting people to start for free. They said they wouldn't bother because ninety-nine dollars per month afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they wouldn't continue with.\nxtmy | It's a new level of frustration when you can't even give your services away for free to people. I felt worthless, and I didn't know what to do. Thankfully, during this time, I was in groups with other gym owners, and I started hearing about marketers and books. I devoured everything I could. And as soon as I stumbled on Dan Kennedy's books, I was hooked.\nmdfm | In his books, he talked about making \"irresistible offers.\" Again, this theme of \"making an offer so good people would feel stupid to say no\" kept reappearing. But this time, remembering what T J had told me, I decided to go all in on this concept, rather than just do what everyone else was doing.\nxjme | But how? Everyone else was selling ninety-nine dollars per month bootcamps. How was I going to compete? So I decided to look at what we did differently. I thought - what do they really want? No one wants a membership; they want to lose weight.\nzb9k | Step number one: Identify Dream Outcome\n5yws | I had heard of weight loss challenges, so I started there.\nt3fi | · Lose twenty pounds in six weeks.\ndyg0 | · Big dream outcome - lose twenty pounds.\n3n0b | · With a decreased time delay - six weeks.\n46bq | Step number two: List Problems\ntocx | Next, I wrote down all the things people struggled with and their limiting thoughts around them. When listing out problems, think about what happens immediately before and immediately after someone uses your product or service. What's the \"next\" thing they need help with? These are all the problems. Think about it in insane detail. If you do, you will create a more valuable and compelling offer as you'll continually be answering people's next problem as it manifests...\n07f7 | So, let's go ahead and list out the problems from a prospect's perspective as you think about them. What points of friction exist for them? I like to think in the sequence that the customer will experience each of these obstacles. Again, channel insane detail (the more problems the better!).\n3cv9 | Example Problem List: Weight Loss\nxa2i | First thing they must do: Buying healthy food, grocery shopping\nxj8o | One. Buying healthy food is hard, confusing, and I won't like it\ngk3j | Two. Buying healthy food will take too much time\n8vzd | Three. Buying healthy food is expensive\n6588 | Four. I will not be able to cook healthy food forever. My family's needs will get in my way. If I travel I won't know what to get.\n1ms8 | Next thing they must do: Cooking healthy food\nb1vx | One. Cooking healthy food is hard and confusing. I won't like it, and I will suck at it.",
