You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ccpt | International Governance PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IN A STATELESS SOCIETY ORAN R. YOUNG
0fpw | CHAPTER SIX
dqn8 | The Effectiveness of International Governance Systems
cop0 | Critical threats to the earth's habitability demand that humankind rise to the challenge of creating new and more effective systems of international environmental governance. These threats are largely anthropogenic in origin and manifest themselves in such forms as desertification, deforestation, ozone depletion, climate change, the loss of biological diversity, disruptions of the global hydrological cycle, and, ultimately, perturbations in coupled atmosphere/ocean/land sys- tems capable of triggering worldwide ecological crises. They have stimulated an unprecedented growth in the demand for governance at the international level. Protecting the stratospheric ozone layer requires sustained cooperation among affluent residents of North America, Europe, and Japan, who must find substitutes for chloro- fluorocarbons, and aspiring residents of Brazil, China, India, and other developing countries, who must resist the temptation to in- crease dramatically their consumption of refrigerants containing these chemicals. Avoiding global warming calls for the development of effective and coordinated emission-control systems to limit the release of greenhouse gases-carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs, ni- trous oxide-from a wide range of sources in every corner of the globe. Stemming the loss of biological diversity entails harnessing socioeconomic forces such as international trade and monetary sys-
lhkq | tems that transcend national borders, even though the actual losses may be region-specific and closely linked to the destruction of moist tropical forests.
82ju | What does it take to develop and maintain effective governance systems to deal with these problems? When we turn from generalities to the specifics of such complex environmental problems as climate change or the loss of biological diversity, the barriers to sustained cooperation seem more substantial than they may appear to be in the simple scenarios often used to illustrate the concepts of interactive decision making and collective action. More often than not, these environmental matters present sharp challenges to those in search of appropriate ways to conceptualize the problem to be solved and of satisfactory methods to address issues of sustainability, social welfare, and equity embedded in them. It is not easy, for example, to devise international regimes that satisfy, at one and the same time, the con- cerns of those whose aim is to spread the benefits of economic growth-and the material wealth that sometimes goes with it-to the developing world and those who are convinced that sustainable devel- opment requires profound changes in the materialistic life-styles of people in both the developed and the developing worlds. Much the same can be said of the difficulties confronting those endeavoring to reconcile emerging northern concerns for relieving pressure on the earth's life support systems and the increasingly insistent southern demands for a restructuring of persistent economic imbalances to meet reasonable standards of equity.
y2qo | The record shows considerable variation in the effectiveness of environmental governance systems operative at the international lev- el. Some regimes (for example, the Antarctic Treaty System or the evolving ozone regime) have been notable successes, while others (for example, many of the international fisheries regimes) have proven relatively ineffective. Despite the unprecedented scope of some of today's environmental problems, much can be learned about the fac- tors that determine the effectiveness of international governance sys- tems from an examination of actual experience with a variety of envi- ronmental regimes. This chapter sets the stage for a systematic study of these determinants of effectiveness by addressing conceptual issues in this realm and exploring the range of variables that require consid- eration in thinking about effectiveness. A growing number of stu- dents of international governance are preparing to take up the chal- lenge of improving our knowledge of this subject.
1piq | What do we mean when we speak of the effectiveness of interna- tional regimes or governance systems? Can we devise some simple way to describe and, ideally, to measure variations in levels of institutional effectiveness? What are the prospects for pinpointing factors that, singly or in combination, determine the success or failure of institu- tional arrangements in international society? Are some of these fac- tors so central that they constitute important, perhaps even necessary, conditions for the achievement of effectiveness across a wide range of places and times? Posed in these general terms, the issue of effective- ness seems straightforward enough. Simply put, we want to find out why some regimes work well, while others have little impact or even become dead letters. Quite apart from the value of such knowledge to those seeking to understand the workings of international society, persuasive answers to this question would be of obvious interest to those responsible for designing and managing governance systems dealing with specific issues.
7fqw | Effectiveness, it is clear, figures in this line of inquiry mainly as the dependent variable, that is, the phenomenon we seek to account for or to explain. Accordingly, our goal is to observe and measure varia- tions in levels of effectiveness (or in some index of effectiveness) and then to construct a set of propositions to explain or predict these variations. Yet the more we bear down on the specification of effec- tiveness as a dependent variable, the clearer it becomes that we are dealing with a suite of related variables or, at best, a multidimensional variable whose separate dimensions need not and frequently do not co-vary in any simple way.1 In the course of my work on international
rhaz | governance, I have been able to identify six distinct dimensions (there may be more) of effectiveness; I call them effectiveness as problem solving, effectiveness as goal attainment, behavioral effectiveness, process effectiveness, constitutive effectiveness, and evaluative effec- tiveness. A discussion of these perspectives on effectiveness will serve to avoid confusion and misunderstandings in our subsequent efforts to pin down factors that explain variations in levels of effectiveness attained by different international environmental governance sys- tems.
wak1 | Effectiveness as Problem Solving
wtfz | First, and undoubtedly foremost, we want to know whether regimes are effective in the sense that they operate to solve the problems that motivate parties to create them in the first place. The problems that stimulate the formation of international regimes are diverse. They may, for example, involve the depletion of renewable resources as in the cases of stocks of fish or fur seals; the allocation of flow resources as in the case of water carried by rivers passing through several juris- dictions; the use of congestible common property resources as in the case of broadcast frequencies or orbital slots; or the conduct of scien- tific research in areas subject to jurisdictional differences as in the case of Antarctica. Also, the problem a regime addresses may be framed differently by various parties to the arrangement or be sub- ject to redefinition over the life of the regime. The whaling regime began as a means of coping with stock depletions to ensure sustain- able yields for consumptive users, for instance, but it has come to focus with the passage of time on the problem of protecting whales from all consumptive uses. Needless to say, judgments regarding the effectiveness of a regime may vary depending on how those making such judgments choose to frame the problem. What is more, the problem itself may change or take on new dimensions with the pas- sage of time. So, for example, most wildlife management regimes originated as devices for avoiding severe stock depletions resulting from excessive harvesting on the part of human users. But over time, the problem of maintaining healthy stocks of wild animals has increas- ingly become a matter of coping with the consequences of habitat destruction.
qy1i | Approached in this way, it is easy to see that the effectiveness of regimes varies greatly. In the fur seal case, the introduction of the
