You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

epyi | We use 8 = 10-3 for the Huber loss. We find that using larger values of & pushes the model to overfit the small compute regime and poorly predict held-out data from larger runs. We find that using a & smaller than 10-3 does not impact the resulting predictions.
y51p | D.3. Predicted compute optimal frontier for all three methods
x95m | For Approaches 2 and 3, we show the estimated model size and number of training tokens for a variety of compute budgets in Table A3. We plot the predicted number of tokens and parameters for a variety of FLOP budgets for the three methods in Figure A3.
yfum | D.4. Small-scale comparison to Kaplan et al. (2020)
ppx4 | For 1021 FLOPs, we perform a head-to-head comparison of a model predicted by Approach 1 and that predicted by Kaplan et al. (2020). For both models, we use a batch size of 0.5M tokens and a
qf11 | maximum learning rate of <LATEX>1 . 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }</LATEX> that decays by 10x. From Kaplan et al. (2020), we find that the optimal model size should be 4.68 billion parameters. From our approach 1, we estimate a 2.86 billion parameter model should be optimal. We train a 4.74 billion parameter and a 2.80 billion parameter transformer to test this hypothesis, using the same depth-to-width ratio to avoid as many confounding factors as possible. We find that our predicted model outperforms the model predicted by Kaplan et al. (2020) as shown in Figure A4.
8oqt | E. Curvature of the FLOP-loss frontier
6zah | We observe that as models increase there is a curvature in the FLOP-minimal loss frontier. This means that projections from very small models lead to different predictions than those from larger models. In Figure A5 we show linear fits using the first, middle, and final third of frontier-points. In this work, we do not take this in to account and we leave this as interesting future work as it suggests that even smaller models may be optimal for large FLOP budgets.
4v5o | F. FLOPs computation
ha9e | We include all training FLOPs, including those contributed to by the embedding matrices, in our analysis. Note that we also count embeddings matrices in the total parameter count. For large models the FLOP and parameter contribution of embedding matrices is small. We use a factor of 2 to describe the multiply accumulate cost. For the forward pass, we consider contributions from:
xrnt | · Embeddings
c8ra | · Attention (Single Layer)
p1l0 | - Key, query and value projections: <LATEX>\left. 2 \times 3 \times \sec \right] \text { len } \times d</LATEX> d_model x (key_size × num_heads)
1i8b | - Key @ Query logits: 2 x seq_len x seq_len x (key_size x num_heads)
5sfj | - Softmax: 3 x num_heads x seq_len x seq len
vk4h | - Softmax @ query reductions: 2 x seq_len x seq_len x (key_size x num_heads)
nsm3 | - Final Linear: 2 x seq_len x (key_size x num_heads) x d_model
jdfw | · Dense Block (Single Layer)
uc9r | - 2 x seq_len x (d_model x ffw_size + d_model x ffw_size)
l0ap | · Final Logits
x815 | - 2 x seq_len x d_model x vocab_size
epbj | . Total forward pass FLOPs: embeddings+num_layersx(total_attention+dense_block) + logits
nmn2 | As in Kaplan et al. (2020) we assume that the backward pass has twice the FLOPs of the forward pass. We show a comparison between our calculation and that using the common approximation C = 6DN (Kaplan et al., 2020) where C is FLOPs, D is the number of training tokens, and N is the number of parameters in Table A4. We find the differences in FLOP calculation to be very small and they do not impact our analysis. Compared to the results presented in Rae et al. (2021), we use a slightly more
g3tm | accurate calculation giving a slightly different value (6.3 x 1023 compared to 5.76 x 1023).
tfra | G. Other differences between Chinchilla and Gopher
5lm9 | Beyond differences in model size and number of training tokens, there are some additional minor differences between Chinchilla and Gopher. Specifically, Gopher was trained with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) whereas Chinchilla was trained with AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019). Furthermore, as discussed in Lessons Learned in Rae et al. (2021), Chinchilla stored a higher-precision copy of the weights in the sharded optimiser state.
wp2c | We show comparisons of models trained with Adam and AdamW in Figure A6 and Figure A7. We find that, independent of the learning rate schedule, AdamW trained models outperform models trained with Adam. In Figure A6 we show a comparison of an 680 million parameter model trained
us5v | with and without the higher precision copy of the weights and with Adam/AdamW for comparison.

94h3 | We follow the same setup as in Rae et al. (2021). To test coreference resolution in Chinchilla, we input a sentence which includes a pronoun reference (e.g., "The librarian helped the child pick out a book because {pronoun} liked to encourage reading."), then measure the probability of the model completing the sentence "{Pronoun}' refers to the" with different sentence roles ("librarian" and "child" in this example). Each example is annotated with the correct pronoun resolution (the pronoun corresponds to the librarian in this example). Each sentence is tested with a female, male, and gender-neutral pronoun. An unbiased model would correctly predict which word the pronoun refers to regardless of pronoun gender.
