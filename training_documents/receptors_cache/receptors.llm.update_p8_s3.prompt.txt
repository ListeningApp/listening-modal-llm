You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

6pmo | Viruses can also exploit host GPCRs to promote viral pathogenesis and survival by expressing virally encoded GPCR agonists or antagonists in order to modulate host cell signalling. For example, KHSV encodes multiple viral cytokines, which have significant sequence similarity to host chemokine agonists and antagonists and can bind to host GPCRs to mediate functions such as chemotaxis of immune cells, and resistance to apoptosis25,36,37. Alternatively, these proteins can bind to and inactivate host-produced ligands in order to shut off or abrogate host immune response38.

kqmi | The Mutation Spectrum of GPCRs in Cancer
g8rd | The generation of vast cancer sequencing resources including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) have revealed that GPCRs and heterotrimeric G proteins are collectively mutated in roughly 20% of all cancers, spanning across numerous tumor types39-42. This is aligned with mutation frequencies of some of the most well-studied cancer-related pathways, including the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/RAS/MAPK and p53 pathways, which are mutated at 46% and 29% of all cancers
nns9 | respectively43. Despite this staggering number, the biological function and consequence of many of these GPCR and heterotrimeric G protein mutations are as of yet largely unknown due to the numerous factors that influence the prediction of cancer-driving mutations. For example, the contribution of gene length must be weighed against the number of mutations in a given gene. Coupled with this, many of the mutations in GPCRs are not isolated to hotspot residues, further hindering efforts to predict their signalling and cellular impact and potential role in cancer. As a result, it has been difficult to infer the biological contexts in which mutations in GPCRs have cancer-driving effects as compared to passenger mutations with little functional impact. Towards this end, there have been numerous recent advances in cancer genomics and methodology aimed at identifying significantly mutated genes, and their associated biological consequences. For example, the MutSig suite of tools builds a model based on several characteristics, including the mutation burden of a gene relative to the background mutation rate (BMR) of each tissue, mutation clustering within a gene and potential hotspots, and the evolutionary conservation of mutations44. These features are then integrated to obtain gene-level mutation significance44,45. For our analysis (Table S3) we have included data generated using MutSig2CV, which refines the BMR predictions by incorporating parameters of mutational heterogeneity such as DNA replication timing and transcriptional activity45. To complement measurements of mutation significance, other approaches have been used to predict the pathogenicity of mutations in cancer, including investigating phylogenetic conservation, allele frequency, proximity to specific genomic features, mapping mutations to protein domains, and assessing patterns of mutual exclusivity with other mutations46. In tandem, the integration of rapidly growing mechanistic data are beginning to shed light on the molecular basis of how cancer-associated mutations may be playing a role, including the systematic mapping of cancer-related alterations on a pathway level43.
9uwy | Of particular relevance to GPCR-driven signalling, structure-function analyses of mutations in GPCRs have begun to provide insight on these observations and a new framework of the functional impact of GPCR mutations is emerging. Projection of cancer-related mutations for TSHR, for example, have revealed an accumulation of mutations clustered at the cytoplasmic tail of helix 6, suggesting that in the absence of a physical hotspot mutation, structural motif hotspots may be more prevalent manifestations of cancer-associated GPCR mutations39. Indeed, our recent pan-cancer analysis of functional somatic mutations in gene families has demonstrated significant enrichment of mutations in a handful of highly conserved regions of GPCRs that regulate GPCR function and activation. These include mutations localized to the DRY motif, which mediates the inactive conformation of class A GPCRs, with particular emphasis on
srly | recurrent mutations in DRY arginine, in addition to the nPxxY motif, both of which are critical regulators of GPCR activation. Mutations in these positions show statistically significant mutual exclusivity between motifs, as well as with activating hotspot mutations in the Ga subunit further supporting the functional significance of these structure-based predictions47. DRY arginine mutations are also mutually exclusive with many common mutant oncogenes that are downstream of GPCR-mediated signalling cascades, including AKT E17K, PIK3CA E545K and JAK2 V617F47. In many cases where the full G-protein-coupling repertoire of GPCRs has not been fully elucidated, recent efforts to systematically predict the G protein-coupling selectivity of GPCRs via functional interaction studies have provided novel insights into these coupling determinants and the subsequent implications both from a structural, and signalling perspective48. Integration of this information with other data types including aforementioned mutation and structure-function analyses will continue to widen and clarify our view of the impact of cancer- associated mutations in GPCRs.
dl6i | Broken down phylogenetically, the adhesion and glutamate GPCR are highly mutated families of GPCRs in cancer; however, their role in cancer is not well defined39. Adhesion GPCRs (aGPCRs) are named as such due to the extended extracellular N terminus containing structural domains such as thrombospondin repeats, and leucine-rich-repeats (LRRs), which participate in a variety of protein-protein interactions and can mediate adhesion to cellular matrix proteins49. The aGPCR subfamily is widely mutated among cancer types in TCGA and a number of aGPCRs are involved in angiogenesis, metastasis, and other critical components of cancer initiation and progression50,51 (Figure 1). Among them, GPR98 (ADGRV1) is the most frequently mutated GPCR across all cancer types. In particular ADGRV1 is mutated in roughly 45% of skin cutaneous melanoma, and is the longest GPCR by amino acid length; however, not much is known regarding its functional impact52 (Table S1). ADGRE5, also known as CD97, was the first aGPCR to be linked to cancer, as its expression was found to be a sensitive marker of dedifferentiation in thyroid carcinomas53,54. While ADGRE5 expression was nearly absent in normal thyrocytes, its levels increased in correlation with thyroid tumor stage53,54. Its over- expression has since been identified in several other cancer types including pancreatic, gallbladder, and esophageal carcinomas, and is linked to metastatic aggressiveness in gastric, colorectal cancers, and particularly in glioblastoma55. Glioblastoma in particular, is known to develop extensive intratumoral hypoxia, and GPR133 (ADGRD1) has been implicated to be critical for glioblastoma growth under hypoxic conditions56.
