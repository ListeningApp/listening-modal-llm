You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3g2y | According to the mass action law, increasing ligand concentration causes a rise in receptor saturation. In the case of a monovalent receptor (complex stoichiometry 1:1), the reaction of receptor saturation shown in eq 1 is sufficient, while polyvalency of the receptor imposes the existence of multiple stages. In order to represent the saturation of n-valent receptor n, equations have to be written as eq 2, where i refers to subsequent numbers from 1 to n. The exact formulas for each stage are given in the Supporting Information (eqs S1-S5).

j30a | In an equilibrium state, formation and dissociation reactions occur at the same rate. Therefore, concentrations of particular reagents remain constant. The ratio of products and substrates concentrations (as approximations of activities) is constant under defined conditions (pH, ion strength, temperature) and is called a reaction constant. For the reaction depicted in eq 1, the reaction constant may be written as eq 3 where Ka refers to the dissociation constant.
7bdk | Ka = [M13 - (TnT)1] [M13].[TnT]

1ujy | According to the geometry of phage particle pIII end, if all peptides are properly synthesized and exposed, they should not affect each other. Currently, there is no evidence that any allosteric effect might be present between peptides. Therefore, each stage dissociation constant equals Ka of the isolated TnT- peptide complex defined in eq 3. Moreover, the cumulative dissociation constant of particular stage saturation may be
qzor | expressed as eq 4 where Ka refers to the dissociation constant of a single complex as eq 3.
a0by | For every case, the equation for TnT mass conservation may be written for both 1:1 and 1:n stoichiometry, as stated in eq 5.

78r8 | The free TnT equilibrium concentration ([TnT]) was expressed as a difference between total TnT concentration „ÎnT) and the sum of phage-bound TnT.
320g | After the assumption of varying saturation levels and complex stoichiometry, each complex concentration may be expressed by total phage concentration (c 13) and TnT- dependent saturation fractions. This equation is explained in the Supporting Information (eq S21 was obtained after combining S15, S17, and S19). In the case of the monovalent receptor, also presented by Friguet,21 eq 5 may be written as eq 6.

s2v1 | ELISA is a widely applied technique in biochemistry that enables the determination of biomolecule concentration.11 ELISA may be used to determine M13 phage concentration using TnT-coated wells and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)- conjugated anti-M13 antibodies.16-18,21 The signal is gen- erated proportionally to the number of phages bound to surface-immobilized TnT. The presence of soluble TnT causes competition between this form and the surface-immobilized form, which leads to a signal decrease. If the signal measured with a predefined concentration of soluble TnT is called a and the signal of the same concentration of phages in the absence of TnT is a0, the fraction of occupied active sites (saturation) may be found (eq 7).

7um8 | An explanation of the derivation of ª ratios is presented in the Supporting Information (eqs S24-S27). Equation 7 is derived in the Supporting Information as eq S29. This approach (first proposed by Friguet21) enables the comparison of a signal from total phage active sites and partially saturated phages. The ratio 4 (eq 7) refers to the ratio of the signal recorded for partially occupied phage's active sites in a mixture of TnT and phage (a) and the signal recorded in the absence of soluble TnT (a0) which may be interpreted as a signal from all active sites. Experimental determination of the ª ratio is a0 necessary to calculate the [TnT] Ka ratio, which is crucial for further analysis.
