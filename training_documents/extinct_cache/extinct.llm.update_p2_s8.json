Firstly, because this review is largely limited to the Western anglophone analytical literature (except for some of the authors mentioned in the last section on extinction studies, which is necessitated by the character of that area of research), it can neither represent the rich variety of arguments and positions found in other philosophical traditions such as so-called continental philosophy and non-Western philosophy, nor does it cover relevant philosophical literature published in other languages. Secondly, by starting with Soul√©'s postulate this review paints a particular narrative of the relevant reasons speaking in its favour or against it. We thereby particularly emphasise matters of moral value (i.e. different intrinsic and instrumental values) for providing reasons against or in favour of species extinctions due to their centrality in the environmental ethics literature, as well as in interdisciplinary conservation debates more broadly. Yet, certainly other somewhat different narratives that, for example, highlight more the differences between different ethical theories (e.g. rights-based versus virtue-focused perspectives) would be as plausible.\nemgw | In the following, we start by presenting some noteworthy themes that have emerged from discussions within environmental ethics that address the concept of extinction and its history within that literature. Then, we turn to different reasons for why anthropogenic extinctions might be morally problematic and cases where anthropogenic extinctions might be justified, and how to respond to extinctions. Finally, we look beyond our own narrow disciplinary perspective and introduce other viewpoints on the ethics of extinction from a body of work called 'extinction studies' before concluding.\nxaqt | Understanding extinction\n5rcb | The history of the concern about extinction in environmental ethics\n524j | A period from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century changed the way extinction was thought about in Europe and North America. During that time, three developments came together. Firstly, mostly thanks to Darwin, the idea of evolution and extinction as its key component replaced creationist ideas that distrusted the very possibility of extinction, if it was not outright denied. Reasons for this former denial are historical, as the influential Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle, unlike some popular writers of the time, paid no attention to fossil bones of no longer existing vertebrates. For them, species could not disappear except locally - a belief in line with the principle of plenitude dating back to Plato, which states that all possible lifeforms necessarily exist and cannot disappear. Figuratively, the extant kinds form a 'great chain of being' and each kind in this chain is there necessarily; thus, the chain is unbreakable, and nature is in balance. This idea prevailed in pre- and early modern Europe and was endorsed by, for instance, Linnaeus as late as the eighteenth century.\nxd3m | Secondly, given the importance of the notion of extinction to evolutionary thinking, extinction was not seen as a matter of concern but rather the opposite: extinct species were too weak to survive, or an extinct species was replaced by another, thus maintaining the balance in nature. Both cases - through weeding out the\n8qb6 | Cambridge Prisms: Extinction\nwkbn | weak and introducing novel species - were regarded as improvements in natural evolution.\nftfg | Thirdly, despite this, and most relevant for thinking about the ethics of extinction, a concern about extinctions as universal and irreversible events started taking shape and was broadly reflected in new legislation such as the Sea Birds Preservation Act of eighteen sixty-nine in the United Kingdom. This historical change is well conveyed by Aldo Leopold when he stated that 'the sailor who clubbed the last auk thought nothing at all. But we, who have lost our passenger pigeons, mourn the loss'. Leopold also already noted that economic considerations fail to provide reasons for protecting those species that lack economic value. Instead of extending economic valuation, as has been proposed later by economists, Leopold saw conservation as action against extinction that also rests on non-anthropocentric ethical ideas. Nevertheless, a systematic philosophical discussion on the ethics of extinction evolved much later with the formation of the academic field of environmental ethics since the nineteen seventies.\n7xi5 | Early books and articles on environmental ethics did not explicitly discuss the ethics of extinction. The discussion focused on the flipside of the coin: Why protect endangered species? One could see here a connection with new legislation, such as the US Endangered Species Act, but the discussion broadened to also include the significance of diversity in nature more broadly, to incorporate the possibility of multiple extinctions in a relatively short period of time and to introduce a new concept, biodiversity. For example, some ethicists have tried to develop a naturalistic account of the human propensity to value species and their diversity.\nw8r5 | Arguably, one of the earliest contributions on the ethics of extinction is Richard Sylvan's (then still known as Routley) famous thought experiment of the last person on earth (originally the 'last man'), firstly formulated in nineteen seventy-three, which can be made relevant for thinking about extinction. Sylvan writes:\nybik | The last man (or person) surviving the collapse of the world system lays about him, eliminating, as far as he can, every living thing, animal or plant (but painlessly if you like, as at the best abattoirs). What he does is quite permissible according to basic chauvinism, but on environmental grounds what he does is wrong.\ngii5 | Later in the same article, he also specifically considers 'vanishing species':\nq5eu | Consider the blue whale. The blue whale is on the verge of extinction because of his qualities as a private good, as a source of valuable oil and meat. The catching and marketing of blue whales does not harm the whalers; it does not harm or physically interfere with others in any good sense, though it may upset them and they may be prepared to compensate the whalers if they desist; nor need whale hunting be willful destruction. The behavior of the whalers in eliminating this magnificent species of whale is accordingly quite permissible - at least according to basic chauvinism. But on an environmental ethic it is not.\na7ao | He asked whether species or nature more broadly are valuable beyond their potential usefulness for humans. What Sylvan's famous case suggests is that the permissibility of extinguishing species - as he argued, allowed by traditional Western ethical systems that conceive of nature as something to be used by humans as they please - is an example of what he called 'human chauvinism', now",
