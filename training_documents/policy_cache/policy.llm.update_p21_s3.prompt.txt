You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

ma93 | Along with the technical and organizational aspects, the Data Protection Act limits the use of IS in everyday work practices. Indeed, the Finnish law about the data protection, especially in social and healthcare services strongly guides the street-level workers' access to data. The IS' functions allow containing various data about the clients, yet the law restricts its use. Thus, the street-level workers needed to be well aware of which data they have access to, as well as what they can register and who else can access the registered data. Confusion about the rights to access data sometimes led to fear of mistakes. From the perspective of fluent everyday work, overcoming the organizational and role-related boundaries to access client's data can sometimes be well justified, but the law restricts the access. Quite naturally, the street-level workers did not want to risk breaking the law even if they needed the data.
c6hh | Conclusions
y7ea | As our findings and Cabrera et al. (2001, 245) accurately illustrate: "[a]nyone who has lived through the implementation of a large-scale technological innovation in an
nav4 | organization has run at some point or another into the crude reality of major organizational and human, rather than purely technological problems.". Indeed, discussions about the technology-driven development of public services often revolve around the aspects, problems and costs of technology as such. Instead, it seems that in the examined context of social services the new IS functions quite well, whereas the hindering and enabling elements of the implementation process are related to other issues than the technology. Next, Table 3 provides a summary of the aspects affecting the implementation of new technology from the street-level bureaucrats' perspective through the analytical framework of public service ecosystems.
gem8 | Change in PSE happens through institutionalization as actors disrupt, maintain, and create institutional arrangements (Rossi & Tuurnas, 2021); different institutional arrangements the different components of the PSE hold are brought together and affecting each other. The findings suggest that one of the crucial aspects guiding the implementation process - and technology-driven development - was the experience of individual SLBs working alone both in practices of their everyday work and, consequently, when implementing the new IS.
e8nr | The individual context represents the micro-level of a PSE. Here, the institutional arrangement as values, beliefs, aims, attitudes and practices of the street-level bureaucrats guided the implementation process of the new IS. For example, the SLBs' individual history and experiences with previous IS' - as well as technology in general - affected their attitudes and beliefs and, ultimately, the implementation of the new IS. Also, their capabilities to learn new as well as unlearn old practices was seen crucial to the successful
k78w | implementation process. As the findings reveal, in social services - related not only to individual context but cutting across the organizational and institutional contexts - the street-level bureaucrats' daily work was often done alone. This, along with the individual beliefs and capabilities to learn, attitudes towards technology and implementation process led to individualized ways of using the IS. As Isett et al. (2006) note, frontline acceptance plays a key role for the success of implementation of new procedures, or as in her, new technologies.
g9du | Although the empirical exploration focuses on the experiences of the SLBs, the findings are not limited to the individual level. On the contrary, the street-level bureaucrats' experiences about the implementation process reveal aspects related to the organizational (meso) and institutional (macro) levels of the PSE. This finding is in line with Carson et al. (2015) who underlined the systemic context for SLB's space for discretion.
f682 | For example, the SLB felt that they did not receive sufficient support and guidance from their managers about how to utilize the features of the new IS, strengthening the role of the SLBs when making decisions about the implementation. This can be considered problematic from organizational and societal aims - choosing not to use for example the structured reporting features of the IS hindered the possibilities to gather data for organizational purposes and, instead, enabled the individualized practices. Consequently, as Torfing et al. (2019; see also Taylor 2014) have argued, we must rethink SLBs' practices, as well as leadership and managerial models in the public sector. Relatedly, the nature and values of social services placing the care and needs of the clients at the core of the practices, thus guiding the SLBs' decisions about the implementation process, can be considered as an overarching aspect that cuts across the levels of PSE.
li1k | The organizational structures and division of social services' work was one of the crucial hindering elements the SLBs experiences foregrounded. These can be considered as aspects associated with the organizational context (meso level of PSE). Eriksson and Andersson (2023) argue that although the research on public services is building on a service logic, the street-level bureaucrats, in practice, are required to address the service logic ideals about active citizens, interorganizational collaboration and collaborative forms of value creation with NPM logic. Here, the social service organizations' organizational structures and division of work provided what Eriksson and Andersson (2023) describe as 'institutionalized NPM' guidelines for the SLB on how to make decisions about the implementation and practices with the new IS.
pbea | SLBs' possibilities to foster multi-actor, interorganizational or even intra-organizational collaboration for the benefit of their clients was heavily reliant on the Finnish law. Thus, the institutional context of the PSE guided the implementation process and the practices of the SLBs implementing the IS.
