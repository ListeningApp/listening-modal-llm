These areas preserve, roughly, the spatial structure of images striking the back of the retina (and are therefore called retinotopically mapped areas), and have a key role in organizing visual input into perceptual units. The visual buffer serves both as a structure (as discussed below) and a process (by actively organizing input into perceptual units).\n87vz | The attention window is a process that selects some localized portion of the visual buffer for more detailed processing.\nym66 | The pattern selected by the attention window is sent along two major pathways for further processing. The object-properties-encoding system analyses object properties (e.g. shape and colour) and runs from the occipital lobe to the inferior temporal lobe in the monkey; the human analogue seems to be the inferior temporal and/or middle temporal gyrus. There is good evidence that this system actually stores visual memories. Input from the attention window is matched to these stored representations, leading to object recognition.\nl0a3 | The second major pathway is the spatial-properties-encoding system, which encodes properties such as location, size and orientation, and runs from the occipital lobe to the posterior parietal lobe. There is considerable evidence that this system has a key role in guiding movements. Not only are the areas in this system active when people or animals engage in spatial tasks, but also damage to it disrupts the encoding of spatial properties.\nu8nw | The two pathways must converge somewhere in memory; this inference is dictated by the simple fact that one can recall where things are located, which requires the cross-indexing of object and spatial properties. The object-properties-encoding system stores modality-specific visual representations. However, much of our knowledge is not modality specific; we can access this knowledge by multiple routes. For example, we can identify a cat when we see it, hear its meow, or feel it snuggling against our shin. This underlines an important distinction: recognition occurs when an input matches a stored unimodal representation, whereas identification occurs when we access information associated with that stimulus. When we recognize something, we know only that we have perceived it before, that it is familiar; when we identify something, we know that it has a certain name, belongs to specific categories, is found in certain locales, and so forth. Seeing a face and knowing that you have seen it before but not knowing when, where, or the person's name or other particulars, is an example of recognition without identification.\nl2v9 | Such reasoning led us to posit an associative memory, which we hypothesize to rely on the angular gyrus and Area nineteen. Representations in associative memory are amodal ('abstract') and multimodal, and store\nafbe | associations to objects, scenes and events. These representations are activated by converging input from the object-properties-encoding and spatial-properties-encoding systems.\n78r8 | In situations in which an object cannot be recognized well (because the input does not match well any previously stored representations), the best-matching representation in associative memory is treated as a hypothesis about the identity of the stimulus. The information look-up process accesses stored information associated with the hypothesized object, and uses such information to guide a top-down search. The information look-up process essentially shunts information from one part of the brain to another.\n320g | According to our theory, information stored in associative memory is used during a top-down search not only to guide the mechanisms that shift attention (to look for a distinctive part or characteristic that should be present if the hypothesis about the stimulus' identity is correct), but also to 'prime' representations in the object-properties-encoding system. One of the more striking facts about the neuroanatomy of the visual system is that virtually all areas connected by afferent fibres are also connected by efferent fibres (i.e. the connections are reciprocal); there is an enormous amount of information flowing backwards in the visual system. We conjecture that the efferent connections are used for 'cooperative computation', and that the sort of priming posited here is at the heart of such processing. This sort of priming facilitates the encoding of an expected part or property (possibly by lowering thresholds, or by increasing sampling rates). Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is critical in implementing the information look-up system.\ntp8g | Finally, there are processes that actually shift attention. These attention shift processes are implemented in several parts of the brain. Researchers distinguish between three different components of this system, one in the posterior parietal lobe that disengages attention from its current location; one in the superior colliculus, frontal eye fields and other neural structures that guides the attention window, as well as the eyes, head and body to a new location; and one in the thalamus that re-engages attention at a new location.\ngxfd | Researchers set out to discover whether this theory could be generalized to humans. In our view, a good neuroimaging experiment hinges on comparing two tasks that are minimally different. In most cases, it is best if only a single aspect of the task is varied at a time; if more than one characteristic is varied, the variables should be manipulated orthogonally (keeping everything else constant while manipulating each one). Thus, in this study we examined the same task, deciding whether words name pictures, but in two conditions: in one, the pictures were presented from canonical (typical) points of view, whereas in the other the pictures were presented from non-canonical (atypical) points of view. Counterbalancing over subjects ensured that the same pictures and words were used equally often in both conditions. Our reasoning was that the canonical views would match stored representations in the object-properties-encoding\ns2v1 | system, and hence be recognized well, and then would be identified immediately. In this case, although all of the other processes would be running at the outset, they would not need to run to completion to perform the task. Figure one is misleading in that it might suggest that each process waits for the products of the previous one before operating. On the contrary, there is good reason to assume that all parts of the brain are 'running' at the same time, and that what changes during task performance is how intensively each one is operating. When processing shifts over time, this is reflected by increased activity in areas that implement the relevant processes.\n```",
