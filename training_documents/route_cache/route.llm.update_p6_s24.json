        "content": "sc5y | Two-Methylhexa-three, five-diyn-two-ol. A modified method reported earlier was used. A mixture of two, seven-dimethyl-three, five-octadiyne-two, seven-diol (one) (nine point nine six grams, sixty millimoles), and potassium carbonate (one point two nine grams, nine point four millimoles) was placed into a vacuum distillation apparatus followed by one milliliter of a high-vacuum oil. The pressure was reduced to thirty Torr, and the apparatus was dipped into a preheated oil bath (bath temperature one hundred ninety to one hundred ninety-five degrees Celsius) and heated rapidly. After the melting of the reaction mixture, the vigorous liberation of acetone occurred and the product started to distill (ninety-five degrees Celsius at thirty Torr). The second distillation (boiling point fifty-two to fifty-four degrees Celsius at three Torr) gave two-methylhexa-three, five-diyn-two-ol (three point five seven grams, fifty-five percent yield): boiling point thirty-six to thirty-seven degrees Celsius at zero point four Torr; proton NMR (CDC13, four hundred point one three megahertz, delta) two point two zero (s, one proton), two point zero two (br s, one proton, OH), one point five four (s, six protons).\n0yab | General Procedure for the Synthesis of Aryldiacetylenes by the Sonogashira Reaction. To the solution of iodoarene were added terminal diacetylene two (one point five zero equivalents), Palladium (five mol percent), and Copper (ten mol percent). The resulting solution was evacuated and flushed with Argon several times and allowed to stir at room temperature. After completion of the reaction (TLC control), the reaction mixture was poured into a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride, extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with saturated solution of ammonium chloride and brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel.\nw95z | Six-(four-chlorophenyl)-two-methylhexa-three, five-diyn-two-ol. This compound was synthesized from two-methylhexa-three, five-diyn-two-ol (six hundred forty-eight point eight milligrams, six millimoles) and one-chloro-four-iodobenzene (four millimoles). The crude product was purified by column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate equals three to one) to afford a yellow solid (eight hundred seventy-two milligrams, ninety-nine percent yield): proton NMR (CDC13, four hundred point one three megahertz, delta) seven point four zero (d, J equals eight point five Hertz, two protons), seven point two nine (d, J equals eight point five Hertz, two protons), one point five eight (s, six protons).\n0i1k | Two-Methyl-six-(four-nitrophenyl)hexa-three, five-diyn-two-ol. This compound was synthesized from three, five-diyne-two-ol (six hundred forty-eight point eight milligrams, six millimoles) and one-iodo-four-nitrobenzene.\ndqlg | The crude product was purified by column chromatography (eluent: ethyl acetate equals three to one) to afford a yellow solid (seven hundred forty-two milligrams, eighty-one percent yield): proton NMR (CDC13, four hundred point one three megahertz, delta) eight point one nine (d, J equals eight point six Hertz, two protons), seven point six two (d, J equals eight point six Hertz, two protons), one point five nine (s, six protons).\np6pq | Six-(four-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-two-methylhexa-three, five-diyn-two-ol. This compound was synthesized from two-methylhexa-three, five-diyn-two-ol (six hundred five point four milligrams, five point six millimoles) and four-iodo-N, N-dimethylaniline (nine hundred eighty-eight point zero milligrams, four millimoles). The crude product was purified by column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate equals five to one) to afford a yellow solid (six hundred fifty-six milligrams, seventy-two percent yield): proton NMR (CDC13, four hundred point one three megahertz, delta) seven point three six (d, J equals nine point zero Hertz, two protons), six point five nine (d, J equals nine point zero Hertz, two protons), two point nine eight (s, six protons), one point five seven (s, six protons).\nzse6 | The halogenation of terminal diynes (method B) is described as follows: To a solution of buta-one, three-diyne five (one equivalent) in ten milliliters of acetone under an atmosphere of Argon and in the dark was added silver nitrate (three mol percent), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for twenty minutes. Then NIS (one point one equivalent) was added, and the mixture was\np2n3 | stirred for several hours until the completion of the reaction (TLC control). Acetone was removed under reduced pressure. Ethyl acetate (fifteen to twenty milliliters) was added to the residue. The resulting mixture was washed with water (three times fifteen milliliters), the organic layer was separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure to yield the crude product, which was purified by column chromatography.\nohh7 | Six-Iodohexa-three, five-diyn-one-ol. This compound was synthesized in accordance with method A from six-(trimethylsilyl)hexa-three, five-diyn-one-ol.",
