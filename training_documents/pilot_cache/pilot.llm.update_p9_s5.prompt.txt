You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

68xu | It is difficult, for me, to look out at "emerging practice" when "current practice" remains nebulous. As an educator, I see students of all ages who are unfamiliar with OT and its role. If OT practice in "emerging practice" helps identify the role of OT for all involved parties, let the research begin!
hd35 | Equally important was the deliberation about the greater risk to the profession from the development of emerging practice. One participant questioned, "Are we making a big mistake professionally as we decide to move away from [the] medical model towards a more social work/social justice model-what will we gain [or] lose? Immediately and [for the] long term."
2zpk | Rewards and Challenges of Emerging Practice
epu7 | All 174 participants were asked to identify the rewards and challenges of emerging practice; 163 (93.7%) valid responses were received. Re- sponses to the question were organized into themes that were inclusive of all comments provided by the participants. Participants identified mul- tiple rewards and benefits to emerging practice. The narrative analysis resulted in the following themes: (a) rewards for the profession, (b) re- wards for clients, and (c) rewards for individual practitioners as shown in Table 3.
7od1 | The rewards of emerging practice for the profession and its clients were many; however, the theme of individual rewards for the occupa- tional therapy practitioner yielded the greatest number of responses. En- gagement in emerging practice offered distinct benefits to the therapist,
0bqy | both tangible and intangible. Financial benefits stem primarily from work- ing outside the third-party reimbursement system that tightly regulates the provision of services. One respondent identified a reward as "getting paid for more than just actual 'face time' with clients." Other financial gains were related to career opportunities resulting from the develop- ment of emerging practices. Nonmonetary rewards stemmed from facil- itating student growth and development in emerging practice roles and collaboration with community members. One respondent described this further:
b780 | Nineteen respondents identified those in emerging practice as pioneers, trailblazers, or innovators who follow their passion to create new cutting- edge practice niches for the profession. Respondents elaborated by describ- ing the elements for success in these endeavors to include persuasiveness, leadership, and innovation.
ccmb | The themes associated with the challenges of emerging practice pre- sented a number of facets. By far, the most frequently identified concerns and barriers associated with emerging practice were funding and reim- bursement for services. If third-party payers reimburse for services in emerging practice settings, reimbursement rates are often lower than for services provided within medical facilities. Additionally, obtaining reim- bursement was perceived to be an "uphill battle" with greater justification and skillful documentation often required from therapists for their services. Developing and implementing effective marketing programs was a strategy identified to obtain payment for services.
ma93 | The challenge associated with identifying and protecting the profes- sion's appropriate domain and scope of practice included the concern from other health professionals that the services provided by the occupational therapists were similar or duplicative to their own. Respondents related this concern, in part, to a general lack of understanding about the value of occupational therapy services, thereby requiring continuous efforts to educate other professionals, families, and community members. The con- cern for the occupational therapy domain of practice also related to an incompatibility with professional regulatory and licensure issues. One ex- ample of this perceived incompatibility was the struggle with maintaining the continuing education requirements for state practice acts as well as gaining the specific knowledge and skills required for emerging practice. Additionally, the definitions of occupational therapy services delineated in practice acts may be too narrow in focus thereby creating potential ethical and legal implications. One practitioner described these challenges as:
c6hh | Other OTs "don't get it" and when OT regulatory agencies don't rec- ognize the practice as "real" OT, there are problems with maintaining licensure. In my practice [rehabilitation counselor and disability case manager], maintaining my OT license is required for maintaining the other certification required for my current practice. Since most of the continuing education relevant to my practice is not accepted for my state's OT licensure renewal (although most of the OT-specific contin- uing education I take is recognized by my other certifications-they are a lot more open-minded), I need to spend a lot of money and take
y7ea | time off for continuing education that has no practical application value for me.
nav4 | In addressing the role of occupational therapy educational programs and student participation, participants articulated the concern for academic preparation, student supervision, and ongoing mentoring at emerging prac- tice settings where occupational therapists are not available on a full-time basis. A final challenge for the profession is to conduct and disseminate research on emerging practice that provides evidence of its efficacy in a timely manner.
gem8 | Much as reimbursement for services was perceived as a barrier to emerg- ing practice for the profession, financial concerns of the individual therapist contributed to the challenges of emerging practice. In particular, the salary and benefits offered in emerging settings, particularly community organi- zations with limited funding, often cannot match those of positions held by occupational therapists in health care settings. A number of identified challenges related to the effort and perseverance to develop new practices. A respondent cautioned, "It usually takes a long time to 'find' your 'niche' and to develop your role to a point where you feel you are making a dif- ference." The final broad theme of challenge to the individual practitioner was one of professional isolation. The drawbacks to being an innovator and practicing autonomously can include a lack of professional support networks, role models, and mentors.
e8nr | Survey Respondents in Emerging Practice
k78w | Fifty-seven respondents identified themselves as providing occupational therapy or occupational therapy-related services in an emerging practice setting or role. The services provided and populations served were very diverse and often specialized in nature. Numerous reported services- including low vision, driver evaluation and training, ergonomic evaluation and consultation, and health promotion and lifestyle redesign services-are often identified as emerging practice in the profession's literature. Other reported services included assistive technology services, home evaluation and modification, caregiver education, psychosocial, and pediatric services. The populations receiving services from the respondents in emerging roles or settings were individuals of all ages as well as specialized populations including children with chronic disabilities, prospective international adop- tive children, students of all ages, at-risk youth, pregnant teens and teen mothers, well elderly, older adults in subsidized or public housing, and low income or at-risk elderly.

li1k | DISCUSSION
pbea | The survey results represent findings of occupational therapists from diverse backgrounds, professional roles, and experiences. As a pilot study, the results cannot be generalized to represent the perspective of all occu- pational therapists. However, two broad areas of discussion are relevant. First, the respondents held wide-ranging views about the nature and scope of emerging practice and its current and future role within the profes- sion. Without a common definition of emerging practice, the descriptions of emerging practice, as well as the practice settings and services identi- fied by the survey respondents, were wide ranging. Many of the settings and roles reflect those identified within the professional literature and by AOTA's Centennial Vision (2003). The most common descriptor of emerg- ing practice was nontraditional, and this term held multiple meanings for the respondents. Community-based settings and services were identified as offering the opportunity to provide services that are occupation-based, holistic, and congruent with the philosophical roots and values of the profession. However, these and other descriptions of emerging practice confirmed therapists perceived emerging opportunities for services very
ccpt | broadly, and the differentiation between emerging or established occupa- tional therapy practices was not always evident.
