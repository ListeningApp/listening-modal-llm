You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5rcb | these key strategic questions are often lost because few of today's leaders have been trained to notice, honor, and utilize the social fabric of learning that occurs through informal "communities of practice" that exist throughout the organization.A community of practice is made of up people who share a common interest and who work together to expand their indi- vidual and collective capacity to solve problems over time.
524j | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
xd3m | Nurturing these learning networks and honoring the questions they care about is another core aspect of the leader's new work. It is important to under- stand how these communities deal with the ques- tions and learning needs that arise in the course of the daily life of the organization. These understand- ings can provide clues about how the knowledge that resides in such communities might be engaged in the service of critical strategic questions. Leaders who take communities of practice into account as impor- tant strategic assets help assure that new work processes or organizational structures do not destroy the fabric of collective knowledge that is woven into these informal groups.
8qb6 | Using Collaborative Technologies. Intranet and groupware technologies are now making it possi- ble for widely dispersed work groups to participate in learning conversations and team projects across time and space. As these tools become even more widely available, the notion of "network leadership" will expand to include supporting widespread online con- versations where members throughout the organiza- tion can contribute their own questions and best thinking to critical strategic issues. The HP case shows how important enabling technology infrastructures are for strategic innovation. Several forward-looking companies, including Hallmark, Kodak, Discover Card, and General Motors, are now using an innova- tive online conversational technology, Communispace (www.communispace.com), to listen to their cus- tomers' concerns and questions at a deep level and generate insights about new products at a faster rate than was previously possible.
wkbn | Such collaborative tools will be a critical factor in how well strategic questions can travel both within the organization and among customers and other stakeholders who are key to success. These technolo- gies of engagement create possibilities for individuals and groups to connect with each other and to the larger whole in ways that were previously unimagin- able. Leaders who are not skilled in their use or who do not recognize their strategic importance and sup- port their use throughout their organizations will be at a significant disadvantage.
ftfg | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
7xi5 | Co-Evolving the Future
w8r5 | It is quite easy to learn the basics of crafting power- ful questions. However, once you understand the importance of inquiry, it's hard to turn back. As your questions become broader and deeper than before, so does your experience of life. There is no telling where a powerful question might lead you. Transformative conversations can result from posing a simple ques- tion such as, "What questions are we not asking our- selves about the situation in the Middle East?" Tantalizing possibilities emerge from the simple act of changing an article from "in" to "for," as in the HP example. Profound systemic change can emerge from creating a process discipline such as the Game Plan for discovering and acting on the "big questions" within a business setting.
ybik | For organizations that need collaborative learning and breakthrough thinking in order to create a sustain- able future, asking "questions that matter" and engaging diverse constituencies in learning conversations are a core process for value creation. Because questions are inherently related to action, they are at the heart of an organization's capacity to mobilize the resources required to create a positive future. Seeing the organi- zation as a dynamic network of conversations through which the enterprise develops encourages members at every level to search for questions related to real work that can catalyze collective energy and momentum. For all of us, thoughtful participation in discovering and exploring powerful questions can make a difference- to our team, to our organization, and to the larger com- munities of which we are a part.
gii5 | Living systems evolve by developing a coherent identity, creating connections in complex webs of rela- tionships, and distributing information widely through- out the organization.At the same time, human systems naturally evolve toward the questions that they ask. Seeing the ways in which the art and architecture of powerful questions can help an organization create its path into the future, and utilizing process principles, tools, and technologies that support this evolution, is everyone's job. For it is only in this way that organiza- tions are able to cultivate both the knowledge required to thrive economically today as well as the wisdom needed to ensure a sustainable future.
