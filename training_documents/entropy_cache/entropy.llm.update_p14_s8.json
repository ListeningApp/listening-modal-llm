Now many people define a kilobyte to be one thousand bytes rather than one thousand twenty-four bytes, in keeping with the usual meaning of the prefix. If you want one thousand twenty-four bytes you're supposed to ask for a 'kibibyte'. When we get to a terabyte, the new definition based on powers of ten is about ten percent less than the old one based on powers of two: ten to the twelve bytes rather than two to the forty approximately one point zero nine nine five times ten to the twelve. If you want the old larger amount of information you should ask for a 'tebibyte'.\nbiqi | Wikipedia has an article that lists many strange units of information. Did you know that two bits is a 'crumb'? Did you even need to know? No, but now you do.\nxl19 | Feel free to dispose of this unnecessary information! All this is just for fun-but I want you to get used to the formula\nj83k | information equals negative log P seven\nnle2 | THE INFORMATION IN A LICENSE PLATE NUMBER\n19po | If there are N different possible license plate numbers, all equally likely, how many bits of information do you learn when you see one?\nsx65 | If you think N alternatives are equally likely, when you see which one actually occurs, you gain an amount of information equal to log N. Here the choice of base B is up to you: it's a choice of units. But what is this in bits? No matter what base you use,\nilzn | log N equals log two N times log base two.\nuzp0 | Since we call log base two a 'bit', this means you've learned log two N bits of information. Let's try it out!\nyq4x | Puzzle eight. Suppose a license plate has seven numbers and/or letters on it. If there are ten plus twenty-six choices of number and/or letter, there are three hundred sixty-seven possible license plate numbers. If all license plates are equally likely, what's the information in a license plate number in bits-approximately?\ni901 | But wait! Suppose I tell you that all license plate numbers have a number, then three letters, then three numbers! You have just learned a lot of information. So the remaining information content of each license plate is presumably less. Let's work it out.\nn98j | Puzzle nine. How much information is there in a license plate number if they all have a number, then three letters, then three numbers? Assume they're all equally probable and there are ten choices of each number and twenty-six choices of each letter.\nxgyu | The moral: when you learn more about the possible choices, the information it takes to describe a choice drops.\nue40 | THE INFORMATION IN A LICENSE PLATE\ntq0f | How much unknown information do the atoms in a license plate contain?\n3z1s | Aluminum has an entropy of about twenty-eight joules per kelvin per mole at standard temperature and pressure. A mole of aluminum weighs about twenty-seven grams. A typical license plate might weigh one hundred fifty grams, and thus have\nune6 | one hundred fifty grams times twenty-seven grams per mole times twenty-eight joules per kelvin per mole is approximately one hundred sixty joules per kelvin\neroy | of entropy. But a joule per kelvin of entropy is about ten to the twenty-three bits of unknown information. Thus, the atoms in such a license plate contain about\nb09g | one hundred sixty times ten to the twenty-three bits is approximately one point six times ten to the twenty-five bits of unknown information.\npsuf | Last time we talked about the information in a license plate number. A license plate number made of seven numbers and/or letters contains\nojfh | log two of three hundred sixty-seven is approximately thirty-six point one eight nine\nqri0 | bits of information if all combinations are equally likely. How does this compare to the information in the actual metal of the license plate?\nhbbb | These days most license plates are made of aluminum, and they weigh roughly between one hundred and two hundred grams. Let's say one hundred fifty grams. If we work out the entropy of this much aluminum, and express it in bits of unknown information, we get an enormous number: roughly\nuy56 | sixteen septillion bits!\nsy3k | Here is the point. While the information on the license plate and the information in the license plate can be studied using similar mathematics, the latter dwarfs the former. Thus, when we are doing chemistry and want to know, for example, how much the entropy of the license plate increases when we dissolve it in hydrochloric acid, the information in the writing on the license plate is irrelevant for all practical purposes.\nido2 | Some people get fooled by this, in my opinion, and claim that \"information\" and \"entropy\" are fundamentally unrelated. I disagree.\nuq3f | JUSTIFYING THE FORMULA FOR INFORMATION\nc006 | Why do we say the information of an event of probability P is\nyatc | I(P) equals negative log P\nny4k | for some base B greater than one? Here's why:\ngqd8 | Theorem. Suppose I: open zero, one close bracket to R is a function that is:\netr7 | One. Decreasing: P less than Q implies I(P) greater than I(Q). This says less probable events have more information.\n3m6c | Two. Additive: I(PQ) equals I(P) plus I(Q). This says the information of the combination of two independent events is the sum of their separate informations.\nh1un | Then for some B greater than one we have I(P) equals negative log P.\nnljo | The information of an event of probability P is negative log P, where you get to choose the base of the logarithm. But why? This is the only option if we want less probable events to have more information, and information to add for independent events.\nookx | Proving this will take some math-but don't worry, you won't need to know this stuff for the rest of this 'course'.\n0h9f | Since we're trying to prove I(P) is a logarithm function, let's write\na5nf | and prove F has to be linear:\nhtog | F of X equals C times X.\nd9zz | As we'll see, this gets the job done.\neovv | X less than Y implies F of X greater than F of Y for all X, Y less than or equal to zero.\nf6vi | Similarly, we can check that Condition two is equivalent to\nqt9q | F of X plus Y equals F of X plus F of Y for all X, Y less than or equal to zero.\nfkn1 | Now what functions F have\nxqgo | F of X plus Y equals F of X plus F of Y\nztv3 | for all X, Y less than or equal to zero?\nd6tt | If we define F of negative X equals negative F of X, F will become a function from the whole real line to the real numbers, and it will still obey F of X plus Y equals F of X plus F of Y. So what functions obey this equation? The obvious solutions are\now58 | F of X equals C times X\nrhnw | for any real constant C. But are there any other solutions?\n78ub | Yes, if you use the axiom of choice! Treat the reals as a vector space over the rationals. Using the axiom of choice, pick a basis. To get F from R to R that's linear over the rational numbers, just let F send each basis element to whatever real number you want and extend it to a linear function defined on all of R. This gives a function F that obeys F of X plus Y equals F of X plus F of Y.\n49qz | However, no solutions of F of X plus Y equals F of X plus F of Y meet our other condition\nvw2p | X less than Y implies F of X greater than F of Y for all X, Y less than or equal to zero\njkfz | except for the familiar ones F of X equals C times X. For a proof see Wikipedia: they show all solutions except the familiar ones are so discontinuous their graphs are dense in the plane!\n1jrv | I(P) equals C times ln P\nurci | but this equals negative log P if we take B equals exp of negative one over C. And this number B can be any number greater than one. QED.\n```",
