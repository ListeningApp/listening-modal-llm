        "content": "z2gn | Four hundred eighteen of Epoxomicin for the proteasome. While iBEp is still highly active against the\nmgx1 | proteasome, we do find that the Biotin-PEG twenty-four linker moderately reduces the efficacy of iBEp\nx0do | relative to Epoxomicin. We therefore chose doses of inhibitor where the effective\nr8qt | concentration of the inhibitor was similar to previous studies using Epoxomicin alone and well within the acceptable range of efficacy given how potent Epoxomicin is as a proteasome inhibitor.\nsga6 |\n7af5 | To test the permeability of our compounds, we incubated primary cortical neurons with iBEp over a time course and prepared both cytosolic and plasma membrane-enriched fractions.\nuds2 | Samples were immunoblotted and probed for cytosolic marker Actin and membrane protein GluR One to validate our fractionation. We found specific biotin signal corresponding to\njp0o | covalent inhibition of the proteasome by iBEp only in the membrane fraction, and not in the\nakty | cytosol, over a twenty-four hour incubation in primary neurons. As an orthogonal measure of cell\nolz9 | penetrance, we tested whether the activity of cytosolic proteasomes was affected by iBEp\n5rex | treatment. We subjected cytosolic and membrane fractions from iBEp-treated neurons to LLVY-\nhiwi | based proteasome activity assays. Cytosolic proteasome activity remains completely intact from\nzsp2 | iBEp-treated neurons compared to DMSO controls, but proteasome activity in the membrane\nqzw0 |\n6hya |\nh0lh | To further validate our neuroproteasome-specific inhibitors, we sought a cellular functional\nu5th | readout of whether our cell-impermeant inhibitors affected cytosolic proteasomes. One of the\nkelb | most penetrant and robust consequences of total proteasome inhibition is the induction of\nxtdb | autophagy as a cellular response mechanism to compensate for the lack of proteasomal\nf48k | degradation. To test this, we assayed three autophagy markers, p sixty-two levels,\npg0s | LC3bI/II ratios, and Ulk One levels. Each are robust markers of different steps of autophagy. p sixty-two\naiap | has been demonstrated to be rapidly induced upon proteasome inhibition and LC3bI/II induction is thought to be slower, while Ulk One is important for early phagosome formation. Cytosolic\n55v8 | proteasome inhibition has been reproducibly demonstrated to induce a strong increase in p sixty-two\n6sol |\ngtra | One important advantage of iBEp is the ability to use over extended timecourses, a property\ntutj |\nxclk | Next, our quantitative proteomics analysis revealed a selective pattern of protein insolubility\npah4 | following neuroproteasome inhibition. We find that only fifty-two proteins become sarkosyl-insoluble\n2avs | in response to neuroproteasome inhibition, in contrast with over two hundred fifty proteins\nd0nn | increasing in the soluble fraction. To narrow in on this list, we quantitated which\nnv44 | proteins show a greater than log-fold change in the insoluble fraction, but showed no change in\nl6cw | the soluble fraction. This analysis identified only four proteins which show significant\nz8po | increases in the insoluble fraction relative to the soluble fraction (Ckmt One, Tau, Taf fifteen, and\nwm8m | Hspb One) and one protein which significantly increases in the soluble fraction and showed no\nfmj9 | change in the insoluble fraction (Plk Two). Of note, Taf fifteen has previously been observed in\n50jk | detergent-insoluble fractions of brains from Alzheimer's patients, correlated with both Amyloid\nfvhd |\n6jwe | Neuroproteasomes are differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms to determine formation of\nkeja |\nn7w8 | Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a fraction of endogenous mouse Tau becomes\nqcfr | sarkosyl-insoluble following neuroproteasome inhibition. We sought to validate these findings\nidjq | by immunoblot and extend them to determine if the same principle would hold for human Tau\np07t | isoforms, without pathogenic and aggregation-driving mutations. We therefore cultured primary\ndeod | mouse cortical neurons from either W T or hTau-KI mice.
