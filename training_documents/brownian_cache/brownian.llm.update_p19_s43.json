        "content": "lrri | that - given our initial conditions considered above - the average position and the two-point function can be expressed as:\n5cl9 | P equals chi sub E_q plus the sum from n equals one to infinity of open bracket e to the power of negative E sub n t e to the power of V of x sub zero over Upsilon p sub n of x sub zero close bracket times the integral from negative infinity to infinity d x x e to the power of negative V of x over Upsilon p sub n of x close bracket (one three one)\nu7a3 | and\nw409 | P equals x squared t equals P x squared sub E_q plus the sum from n equals one to infinity of open bracket e to the power of negative E sub n t e to the power of V of x sub zero over Upsilon p sub n of x sub zero close bracket times the integral from negative infinity to infinity d x x squared e to the power of negative V of x over Upsilon p sub n of x close bracket (one three two)\nm04y | where the subscript E_q indicates the equilibrium value, and E sub n and p sub n of x are respectively the eigenvalues and normalized eigenfunctions of the corresponding Schrödinger-like problem. Obtaining the spectrum E sub n and p sub n of x may be complicated by the fact that the actual Schrödinger potential U bar (thirty-five) can develop temperature-dependent features as the temperature is decreased - see Fig. fifteen. Even for the simple polynomial potential in the Langevin equation it is clear that at low temperatures it becomes non-trivial, developing highly asymmetrical trapping wells. The increasing energy gap between the two minima indicates that, for a fixed initial condition, higher-order terms in the spectral expansion can become important as the temperature is lowered.\n23jk | To illustrate the importance of these higher-order terms for the two-point function evolution in the polynomial potential we examine the accuracy of a finite truncation of the spectral expansion at two temperatures, Upsilon equals ten and Upsilon equals twenty-two, for the evolution of P equals x squared t, initializing trajectories at x equals one: P of x, t equals zero equals delta of x minus one. In\noa63 | Fig. sixteen we plot the error associated with a finite truncation of the spectral expansion, keeping only the first two (dashed line) or fifty (solid line) terms, at two different temperatures Upsilon equals twenty-two (green, top curve) or Upsilon equals ten (blue, bottom curve). This error is computed by comparing the truncated expansion to the numerical solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. At early times, the error associated with keeping only two terms is larger than when\ne3lv | fifty terms are kept, as one would expect, the discrepancy being more pronounced at lower temperatures. As the system relaxes, the contribution from the higher order terms decreases and the errors of the two truncations converge, until they are essentially indistinguishable at later times, as expected. This decay of the contribution from the higher eigenvalues occurs faster for the higher temperature, making the two-term truncation more accurate earlier. This observation reinforces our inference from the previous paragraph that as temperature is lowered, higher-order terms in the spectral expansion become more important for accurately describing the evolution, at least for a fixed initial condition. Crucially, this offers an explanation for why the LPA plus WFR offers poorer agreement as temperature is lowered since it would be expected to most accurately describe circumstances where the lowest order terms in a spectral expansion dominate.\nrqv6 | The relation between the spectral expansion and the\noa48 | range of validity of the effective action's derivative expansion is not entirely straightforward however, as it would also depend on the initial condition. The quantification of this relation would be an interesting undertaking which we leave for future work.\n3fp1 | Eight. Summary\n557x | Collecting results scattered in the existing literature, we have recalled how Brownian motion can be formally described by a path integral involving a Euclidean Supersymmetric action and how an effective average action functional Gamma of chi, incorporating the effects of the fluctuating force and encoding all statistical properties of the process, can be calculated using functional Renormalisation Group methods. We emphasized the importance of utilizing the underlying symmetries of the problem, paying attention to the boundary terms which are often dropped, and showed how these can correctly incorporate any initial condition and, correspondingly, non-equilibrium evolution. The fRG flow equations were written down for the first two orders of the widely used derivative expansion of the effective action, referred to as the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) and Wavefunction Renormalisation (WFR). We used a particular type of regulator, the frequency independent Callan-Symanzik regulator, for which the flow equations take on a relatively simple form, and further recalled that obtaining flow equations within the supersymmetric framework is convenient for ensuring compatibility with the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, something that is not a priori obvious or guaranteed if one starts with the Onsager-Machlup form of the action (thirty) and considers it a Euclidean N equals one scalar theory in one dimension with the Schrödinger potential U bar equals Upsilon over four V double prime, minus one over four open bracket V prime close bracket squared. We also reviewed how Brownian motion can be solved using a spectral expansion method of the Fokker-Planck (F-P) equation in a standard way.",
