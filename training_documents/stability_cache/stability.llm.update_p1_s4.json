This study included six thousand nine hundred thirty children across early childhood, or T one, late childhood, or T two, and early adolescence, or T three, from the general population. Latent profile analysis identified psychopathology subgroups and latent transition analysis quantified the probability that children remained within, or transitioned across psychopathology subgroups. We identified four psychopathology subgroups: no problems, T one eighty-five point nine percent, T two seventy-nine percent, T three seventy-eight percent; internalizing, T one five point one percent, T two nine point two percent, T three nine percent; externalizing, T one seven point three percent, T two eight point three percent, T three ten point two percent; and the dysregulation profile, or DP, T one one point seven percent, T two three point five percent, T three two point eight percent. From T one to T two, forty-four point seven percent of the children remained in the DP. Between T two and T three, thirty-three point six percent remained in the DP; however, ninety-one point four percent were classified in one of the psychopathology subgroups. Our findings suggest that for many children, internalizing or externalizing symptoms encompass a transient phase within development. Contrary, the DP resembles a severe at-risk state in which the predictive value for being in one of the psychopathology subgroups increases over time.\ny2qo | Introduction\n1piq | It is widely known that children with symptoms of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence are at higher risk of psychopathology in adulthood. Studying the stability and change of child behavior over time can elucidate those characteristics of psychopathology that are transient phases of development versus those that signal persistent psychopathology. Symptoms of psychopathology in children can be divided broadly into two domains: namely internalizing, such as anxiety, and externalizing problems, such as aggressive behavior. Additionally, there is a group of children with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. In the literature these children have been labeled as either a comorbid group or a group with the dysregulation profile, or DP.\n7fqw | Many studies have assessed the prevalence of psychopathology and the continuity of individual domains of psychopathology separately, such as depressive symptoms or aggressive behavior. These studies provide evidence that overall stability decreases when the time interval between the first measurement and follow-up waves increases, and that externalizing behavior tends to be more stable than\nrhaz | internalizing behavior. Additionally, stability in symptoms of psychopathology has been shown to be higher in children who were older at initial assessment, suggesting that symptoms of psychopathology become more predictive of persistent psychopathology with age. However, studying persistence and change of individual domains of psychopathology has two limitations. First, as internalizing and externalizing symptoms are highly comorbid, the continuity and change of the correlated domains will likely, to some extent, reflect the same underlying process. Second, when there is a reduction of symptoms in one domain, we do not know whether this reflects a decrease in overall symptoms, or alternatively, a change only in those specific symptoms, such as a decrease in aggression coupled with an increase in attention problems.\nwak1 | An increasingly adopted method that identifies subgroups of children based on their continuous symptoms across domains of psychopathology is latent profile analysis, or LPA. This data-driven approach minimizes the heterogeneity of comorbid symptoms and allows for a more integrated analysis of child behavior compared to assessing specific domains, such as depressive symptoms, separately. In a recent review, twenty-three studies that used LPA to study symptoms of psychopathology in four to eleven year-old children were compared. Three of these studies analyzed symptoms across internalizing and externalizing domains in a population-based setting, of which two were performed at younger ages in the current sample. All studies identified four psychopathology subgroups: no problems, internalizing, externalizing, and a comorbid or DP group. Across all ages, approximately two percent of the population was classified in the DP with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. The percentage of children included in either the internalizing or externalizing subgroup differed substantially between the two studies, with prior work in early childhood showing higher rates of externalizing, but lower rates of internalizing symptoms compared to studies in later childhood and adolescence. An internalizing subgroup was present in toddlers aged three to four point five years and children between five and nine years of age, with four point eight percent and five point three percent being included in the internalizing subgroup in these age ranges, respectively. An externalizing subgroup was present as early as one point five to two point five years of age, with eleven point one percent of the children exhibiting this profile. Further, between three and four point five years of age, six point five percent was included in the externalizing profile and between five and nine years of age, the proportion of children included was seven point three percent. Within another sample, assessing children in late childhood, mean age seven point five years, and early adolescence, mean age fourteen years, respectively sixteen point one percent and thirteen point nine percent of the children were included in the internalizing and two point five percent and four point four percent in the externalizing subgroup.\nwtfz | To answer questions on individual developmental trajectories within or across psychopathology subgroups, latent\nqy1i | transition analysis, or LTA, can be applied. During development, children can either remain in the same subgroup over time, or transition between psychopathology subgroups. The former is typically referred to as homotypic continuity, which elucidates the predictive validity of children remaining in the same subgroup at each subsequent time point. Transitioning between psychopathology subgroups is referred to as heterotypic continuity, in which an earlier psychopathology subgroup can be an underlying risk factor for a child to transition to a different subgroup. Earlier work on the stability of symptoms of psychopathology in children has shown that stability increases with age and that between mid-childhood and early adolescence, homotypic continuity is higher for the internalizing and externalizing subgroups than for the DP. More specifically, from those children included in the internalizing subgroup in late toddlerhood, only twenty-three percent remained in this subgroup in early childhood and from those identified with internalizing symptoms in late childhood, sixty-one percent exhibited internalizing symptoms in early adolescence. Likewise for the externalizing subgroup, homotypic continuity was present for thirty-one percent between early and late toddlerhood, thirty-nine percent between late toddlerhood and early childhood and sixty-two percent between late childhood and early adolescence. Regarding the DP, homotypic continuity did not consistently increase across age. Between early and late toddlerhood, late toddlerhood and early childhood, and finally between late childhood and early adolescence, homotypic continuity of the DP was present for thirty-seven percent, eighteen percent and forty-four percent.",
