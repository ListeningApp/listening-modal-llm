Its partition function is\nt29r | Z equals De-exp negative BEi IEX.\nddhd | where B E R is the coolness.\ne69f | The partition function counts the points of X but it counts points with large energy less, since they're less likely to be 'occupied'.\nq12e | If ß equals one over kT, points with energy E; much greater than kT count for very little.\nvj9y | But as T approaches positive infinity, all points get fully counted and Z approaches the cardinality of X. In physics we call Z the number of accessible states.\ng0bb | Say we have a system with some countable set of states X. In thermal equilibrium at temperature T, the probability that the system is in its ith state is proportional to exp of negative BE;, where E; is the energy of that state and ß is the coolness. Thus, physicists say the partition function\nk09q | Z equals sum over i EX of exp negative BEi.\nw30h | is the number of accessible states: roughly, the number of states the system can easily be in at temperature T, where ß equals one over kT.\n4vcv | This is a funny thing to say, because being 'accessible' is not a yes-or-no matter. A more precise statement is that the partition function counts states weighted by their accessibility exp negative ßE;. States whose energy is low compared to kT are highly accessible, or probable, because exp negative BE; is close to one if E; is less than kT. States of high energy are more inaccessible, or improbable, since exp negative BE; is close to zero if E; is much greater than kT.\niphf | Calling the partition function the 'number of accessible states' emphasizes how it generalizes the cardinality of X, meaning its number of points. Let's make this precise! Let's call a set X with a function E: X to R an energetic set. I will write it merely as X, so you need to remember it comes with an energy function. I will call its partition function Z of X:\njdf8 | Z of X equals sum over i EX of exp negative BEi.\n59yt | If X is finite we don't have to worry about the convergence of this sum. My main message is this:\ne2hn | The partition function Z of X does for energetic sets what the cardinality of X does for sets.\ngojw | For example, just like the cardinality, the partition function adds when you take disjoint unions, and multiplies when you take products! Let's see why.\nf57y | Puzzle thirty-five. The disjoint union X plus X prime of energetic sets E from X to R and E prime from X prime to R is again an energetic set: for points in X we use the energy function E, while for points in X prime we use the function E prime. Show that the partition function obeys the law Z of X plus X prime equals Z of X plus Z of X prime, at least for finite energetic sets.\njlv5 | Puzzle thirty-six. The cartesian product X cross X prime of energetic sets E from X to R and E prime from X prime to R is again an energetic set: define the energy of (x, x prime) in X cross X prime to be E(x) plus E(x prime). This is how it really works in physics. Show that the partition function obeys the law Z of X cross X prime equals Z of X multiplied by Z of X prime, at least for finite energetic sets.\nzw42 | Puzzle thirty-seven. Show that if X is a finite energetic set, its partition function Z of X approaches its cardinality of X as T approaches positive infinity.\nzgr4 | The key virtue of cardinality is that two sets are isomorphic that is, there exists a one-to-one and onto function between them if and only if they have the same cardinality. This generalizes to energetic sets if we use the partition function instead of the cardinality! Let's say two energetic sets with energy functions E from X to R and E prime from X prime to R are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one and onto f from X to X prime which is compatible with their energy functions, meaning\nocdz | E prime of f(x) equals E(x)\n0ii3 | for all x in X.\n2gqg | Puzzle thirty-eight. Show that two finite energetic sets are isomorphic if and only if they have the same partition function. Hint: the key is to show that the functions exp of negative E over kT for various energies E in R are linearly independent. As a step toward this, show that a finite linear combination\ni4a8 | can only be zero if ci equals zero for the smallest energy Ej.\nfupn | Puzzle thirty-nine. Make up a category of energetic sets, where morphism are maps that are compatible with their energy functions. Prove that it is a category.\n8yo3 | Puzzle forty. Show the disjoint union of energetic sets is the coproduct in this category. Puzzle forty-one. Show that what I called the cartesian product of energetic sets is not the product in this category.\nlm4p | Puzzle forty-two. Show that what I called the 'cartesian product' of energetic sets gives a symmetric monoidal structure on the category of energetic sets. So we should really write it as a tensor product X tensor X prime, not X cross X prime.\nmpm5 | Puzzle forty-three. Show this tensor product distributes over coproducts: X tensor (Y plus Z) is isomorphic to X tensor Y plus X tensor Z.\nstwt | We can go even further and define not only a partition function for energetic sets, but also an expected energy, free energy, and entropy, using the formulas we've seen earlier. These obey a bunch of rules like this:\npcec | Puzzle forty-four. Define the entropy of an energetic set by\njqe8 | S of X equals k times ln of Z of X plus B times ln of Z of X.\nurkt | Show that\n0dx9 | S of X tensor Y equals S of X plus S of Y.\ngilw | seventy-two.\nx96u | Entropy comes in two parts.\n3txt | The entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium is always the sum of two parts:\nqe3d | One. The free energy part:\nod26 | negative F over T equals k ln Z.\nl4k6 | This is Boltzmann's constant times the logarithm of the number of accessible states.\ny4a0 | Two. The expected energy part:\nbnif | (E) over T.\nq018 | This equals ln(kT) if the system has n degrees of freedom and its energy is a positive definite quadratic form.\njbak | Before we dive into examples, it's good to think one last time about the entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium. We've seen that this entropy is always the sum of two parts, which we could call the free energy part negative F over T and the expected energy part (E) over T. But there are various ways to think about this. One is simply that it follows from F equals (E) minus TS: the free energy is the expected energy minus the useless energy. But here is another way to think about it.\ne9cp | In his early work, Boltzmann said the entropy of a system is k times the logarithm of the number of states it can occupy. This is true if all these states are equally probable. But typically some states are more probable than others. We could try to address this by replacing the number of states with the number of accessible states\n94lh | Z equals sum over i EX of exp negative BEi.\njxk1 | Here we count states weighted by their accessibility exp negative BE;. If we try to follow Boltzmann's prescription with this adjustment we get k ln Z equals F over T. This is the free energy part of the entropy.\nwgvf | In many situations this is close to the true entropy. But this clearly can't be all there is to it. After all, suppose we add the same constant c to the energy of each state. Then the probability of each state in thermal equilibrium is unchanged, so the entropy must stay the same! But the accessibility of each state gets multiplied by exp negative ßc, so we have to subtract kfc from the free energy part of the entropy. There must be some compensating term and this is the expected energy part of the entropy, (E) over T. When we add c to the energy of each state, this goes up by c over T equals kBc.\n```",
