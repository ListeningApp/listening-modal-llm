You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

0yab | To address face and content validity of the instrument, five occupa- tional therapists who had emerging practice expertise reviewed a draft of the survey and provided feedback on the format and content of individ- ual survey questions. The written survey requested information about the respondents' current occupational therapy practice setting, job title, and employment status. Respondents were asked to identify whether they were providing occupational therapy or occupational therapy-related services in an emerging role or setting. If respondents answered yes, a series of questions followed requesting information about the emerging practice role or setting, services provided, population(s) served, the respondents' educational background, years of professional experience, and factors con- tributing to the development of the knowledge and skills for practice in the emerging roles or settings. Last, all respondents completing the sur- vey were asked to answer two open-ended questions about the nature of emerging practice and its challenges and rewards. Intentionally, a defini- tion of emerging practice was not provided within the recruitment letter or on the survey instrument to facilitate broad consideration of the research questions.
w95z | Data Analysis
0i1k | The survey yielded both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 software for numerical data (2001), and version six (N6) of NUD*IST software (2002) was used to analyze qualitative or text data. Narrative responses to the open-ended questions from the survey were coded and analyzed for content and specific themes. Descriptive statistics were computed for the numerical responses obtained from the closed-ended questions included in the survey.
dqlg | RESULTS
p6pq | All Survey Respondents
zse6 | One hundred and seventy-four occupational therapists (24.9%) of the 700 therapists in the sample returned the survey. The response rate, while low for survey research, was considered adequate for analysis and reporting given the lack of a comparable survey published in the literature (Babbie, 2001). At the time of the survey, 166 (95.4%) of the respondents reported themselves to be currently employed. Of those currently employed, 132 (79.5%) reported their job duties to include the provision of occupational therapy services, 132 (79.5%) were employed 30 hr or greater weekly, and 34 (20.5%) were employed on a part-time basis of less than 30 hr weekly. Table 1 presents information about the respondents' years of experience, current employment settings, and educational backgrounds. Notably, 101 (58.4%) of the respondents reported 20 or more years of occupational therapy experience.
p2n3 | The Nature of Emerging Practice
ohh7 | All 174 participants were asked to describe emerging practice in occupa- tional therapy; 167 (96.0%) valid responses were received. Responses were organized into two themes according to the frequency of the responses: (a) the settings and services associated with emerging practice and, (b) the rationale for emerging practice. Frequently, a participant's description of emerging practice fits more than one theme. Consequently, the number of responses tallied for each theme does not correlate directly to the number of valid responses. Table 2 summarizes the results for the two themes.
vbni | Theme one: settings and services associated with emerging practice. The greatest number of responses identified nontraditional occupational
dgcw | therapy services provided in settings other than health care systems, school systems, clinics, and long-term care facilities as emerging practice. Spe- cific examples of nontraditional services included health and wellness promotion, low vision services, or injury prevention programs. Although labeled nontraditional services, participants correlated the services pro- vided with the promotion of occupational performance, the philosophy of occupational therapy, and the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process (AOTA, 2002).
gvwz | Respondents also identified those practice settings believed to be more conducive to occupational performance and to achieving independence, such as the home environment, as emerging practice settings. The next most frequent response included community-based services, such as occu- pational therapy services to the homeless population, programs for persons with mental illness or addictions, day programs for adults with develop- mental delays, and transitional housing and employment programs, as emerging practice. Sixteen responses explicitly labeled emerging practice as reemerging practice. These respondents related the nature of emerging
sk5m | practice to services provided at an earlier time in the profession by the profession's founders and by practitioners in the 1960s and 1970s, thereby classifying emerging practice as a new name for a familiar concept. One respondent commented, "We return to our roots in the settlement house system. Settlement houses were change-making institutions. We are return- ing to being change makers rather than servants of a consumer society." Additional descriptions of emerging practice included the delivery of novel or innovative occupational therapy services in traditional practice settings. Examples offered included a mini-putting green for orthopedic patients and educational programs for home health aides. The theme of research support for emerging practice included the recognition that research evi- dence is needed to justify emerging practice services and to demonstrate meaningful outcomes that will be reimbursed. Additionally, respondents noted that as academic communities develop emerging practice opportu- nities, there is a delay in time before the profession as a whole accepts and incorporates the practice strategies.
qws8 | Theme two: rationale for emerging practice. One rationale for emerg- ing practice was the successful promotion of participation in occupations among individuals, groups, or communities through the development of
877u | occupational therapy services to underserved or unserved clients. In this process, respondents described the importance of practitioners conducting a needs assessment as a first step in developing a service delivery model for a new population. A practitioner described this concept, "Therapists do not enter with preconceived notions about what needs to be done, rather they identify needs that emerge as an outgrowth of interactions among what people need and what the environment has to offer."
rzhj | A second rationale for emerging practice related to its perceived sig- nificance to the profession. Respondents indicated that emerging practice areas are critical for development despite the inherent challenges to the pro- cess of developing and delivering services. However, an alternative view of emerging practice was that of being problematic for the profession. A respondent pointed out:
bfax | It is difficult, for me, to look out at "emerging practice" when "current practice" remains nebulous. As an educator, I see students of all ages who are unfamiliar with OT and its role. If OT practice in "emerging practice" helps identify the role of OT for all involved parties, let the research begin!
f2y8 | Equally important was the deliberation about the greater risk to the profession from the development of emerging practice. One participant questioned, "Are we making a big mistake professionally as we decide to move away from [the] medical model towards a more social work/social justice model-what will we gain [or] lose? Immediately and [for the] long term."
o7qm | Rewards and Challenges of Emerging Practice
d52l | All 174 participants were asked to identify the rewards and challenges of emerging practice; 163 (93.7%) valid responses were received. Re- sponses to the question were organized into themes that were inclusive of all comments provided by the participants. Participants identified mul- tiple rewards and benefits to emerging practice. The narrative analysis resulted in the following themes: (a) rewards for the profession, (b) re- wards for clients, and (c) rewards for individual practitioners as shown in Table 3.
qlbb | The rewards of emerging practice for the profession and its clients were many; however, the theme of individual rewards for the occupa- tional therapy practitioner yielded the greatest number of responses. En- gagement in emerging practice offered distinct benefits to the therapist,
