        "content": "ym66 | Although hydrogen storage has been extensively researched, to the authors' knowledge, there is currently no recommendation as to which rock type, porosity, and permeability is best suited for UHS. Therefore, requirements for the effective porosity (i.e., connected porosity), intrinsic permeability and reservoir thickness for UHS operations are derived from the experience of the hydrocarbon and geothermal industry as well as conceptual studies on potential international hydrogen storage in depleted reservoir settings: Chadwick et al. summarized that porosities and permeabilities of at least zero point two zero and five hundred millidarcies (approx. five times ten to the negative thirteenth square meters) are considered ideal geologic storage conditions. Porosities of less than zero point one and permeabilities of less than two hundred millidarcies (approx. two times ten to the negative thirteenth square meters) are considered cautionary indicators by these authors. Sedlacek propounds that from a geological and\nl0a3 | reservoir perspective porosities and permeabilities within the range of eighteen to fifteen percent and greater than one hundred millidarcies are suitable for gas reservoirs, respectively. All these indicative limits are consistent with the study by Pfeiffer and Bauer for subsurface porous media hydrogen storage, which used on-site and off-site porosities and permeabilities of the Middle Rhaetian (main sandstone) of Northern Germany of zero point three three and five hundred seventy-two millidarcies, respectively. Similar porosities (zero point one to zero point three) and permeabilities in the range of twenty to two thousand five hundred millidarcies are also used by other studies on UHS. On the basis of these literature values, we suggest permeabilities and porosities greater than five hundred millidarcies and zero point two, respectively, for optimal and safe operation of UHS systems. However, the range of porosity and permeability depends on the specific properties of the rock formation, so a thorough petrophysical characterization of the rock is required in advance to determine its suitability for hydrogen storage. In addition to the consideration of intrinsic permeability, the characterization of relative permeability in wet porous rocks is crucial for optimizing storage capacity and recovery efficiency. The determination of the relative permeability of hydrogen-brine rock systems is very complex as it depends on the number of hydrogen injection and reproduction cycles as well as the capillary forces responsible for residual hydrogen trapping. Accordingly, these parameters should be determined based on experimental measurements to determine the intrinsic permeability.\nu8nw | Three point three. Storage depth, sealing capacity, and integrity of caprock\nl2v9 | The seal capacity of a reservoir refers to the ability of the rock layers above the reservoir (seals) to prevent the upward migration of fluids or gases out of the reservoir. The seal capacity is therefore critical for the effective trapping and storage of hydrogen in a reservoir, allowing for the efficient extraction and utilization of the resource. The dominant trapping mechanism is the capillary properties of the cap rock that will trap a hydrogen column until the net buoyancy (i.e., difference between hydrogen and brine) exceeds the capillary displacement pressure of the seal. The properties that define the capillary entry pressure are the size of the largest interconnected pore throat of the cap rock, the hydrogen-brine interfacial tension and wetting behavior of the cap rock with respect to hydrogen and brine, expressed by the brine-rock-hydrogen contact angle theta (see detailed review by Aslannezhad et al.). The height of the trapped hydrogen column can thus be expressed by balancing the buoyancy and capillary entry pressure:\nafbe | H equals two times I F T times cosine theta divided by R times G times delta rho. One.\n78r8 | The hydrogen-water and hydrogen-brine interfacial tension was measured experimentally by Chow et al. and Hosseini et al. and was shown to decline with depth, but increase with salinity. However, under storage conditions, one thousand meters and fifty degrees Celsius, the I F T remains relatively high (approximately seventy millinewtons per square meter) and hydrogen and brine remain immiscible. Hydrogen wettability of selected minerals were also measured and calculated in a few studies. Hydrogen wettability of quartz (pure and aged with stearic acid) were reported to increase with organic acid surface concentration, pressure and temperature (Iglauer et al.,\n320g | Besides the withdrawal, working volume (W V) and higher heating value (H H V) of methane (C H four) and hydrogen (H two) are given for the respective fields.
