        "content": "xd3m | Approaches to estimating X sub two left parenthesis reanalysis right parenthesis and X sub three filtering from observations using the maximum likelihood method are discussed in the exercises. We next introduce a general Bayesian approach to data assimilation and then return to this example.\n8qb6 | Twenty point three - Bayesian Approach\nwkbn | Chapter Twenty. Data Assimilation\nftfg | The contemporary approach to analysis and forecasting problems is based on Bayes' rule. This rule was first formulated by the English mathematician and Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, seventeen hundred one to seventeen sixty-one. It yields estimates that are asymptotically correct and does not require an appeal to the law of large numbers, which would make little sense in the climate context. To simplify the following presentation, we assume that all state variables and data are finite-dimensional vectors-a reasonable assumption for data but a substantial simplification for state variables.\n7xi5 | Suppose we are interested in estimating a vector X of process variables with a known or assumed P D F F X. The distribution may come from long-term observations or from another forecast model and is referred to as the prior distribution on X. The data model uses a vector Y of observations of the components of X, which may also include other random effects. We assume that for each possible realization x of X, the conditional distribution F Y given X of Y given x is known. This is essentially the data model.\nw8r5 | Now, suppose that the observation of Y at a particular instance results in the value y. The goal is to incorporate this value in the distribution of X by constructing the conditional distribution F X given Y of X given y. This conditional distribution is referred to as the posterior distribution on X. To find its formula, we note that the joint probability density F X Y of process variables and observations can be expressed in two ways,\nybik | Twenty point seven\ngii5 | \nq5eu | The prior distribution F X is assumed to be known, as is the data model F Y given X; the posterior distribution F X given Y is sought, and the distribution of the observations F Y is unknown. After dividing both expressions by F Y of y, we obtain Bayes' rule,\na7ao | F X given Y of x equals F Y given X of y times F X of x over F Y of y.\n29a3 | Twenty point eight\nsb1e | Note that both sides depend on x and y. The quantity y is given as an observation; therefore the denominator on the right-hand side is fixed, although unknown. The entire equation has the form\nw2yn | F X of x is proportional to F X given X of y times F X of x, twenty point nine,\nap6l | where the implied proportionality constant depending on F Y makes the term on the left a P D F. The constant can be found and equality established by computing an integral, either with analytical techniques or with numerical simulations.\niest | In the case of Gaussian random variables, all integrations that would be required in equation twenty point nine can, however, be replaced by matrix algebra, as the following lemma shows.\ncox8 | Lemma Twenty point one. Let X and Y be Gaussian random variables such that X follows normal distribution with mean U and covariance P and Y given X follows normal distribution of H X and R, where H is a matrix. Then X given Y follows normal distribution with mean U star equals U plus K Y minus H U and covariance P star equals I minus K H P, where K is the gain matrix,\nppqi | K equals P H transpose times R plus H P H transpose inverse. Twenty point ten.\noxou | Proof. According to equation twenty point nine, the conditional probability density F X given Y satisfies\n495n | F X given Y of x is proportional to exponent of negative open parenthesis x minus H y transpose R inverse x minus H y minus y minus U transpose P inverse y minus U. Twenty point eleven.\nawri | Twenty point four. Sequential Data Assimilation\nbl28 | Completing the square, we obtain a Gaussian distribution,\nd5bz | F sub X given script Y of x is proportional to exponent of negative one half open parenthesis x minus mu star transpose P star inverse x minus mu star. Twenty point twelve,\nap5o | with\n7zvf | mu star equals script E of X given y equals open parenthesis P inverse plus H transpose R inverse H close parenthesis inverse open parenthesis P inverse mu plus R inverse H transpose y close parenthesis equals mu plus K open parenthesis y minus H mu close parenthesis, P star equals variance of X given y equals open parenthesis P inverse plus H transpose R inverse H close parenthesis inverse equals I minus K H P. We leave the details of these calculations to the reader.\nmov9 | The distribution F sub X given script Y given in the lemma is the posterior distribution. Its covariance matrix P star does not depend on the value y. The lemma tells us that P star equals P minus C, where C is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix. In this sense, the posterior variance is smaller than the prior variance, and we have reduced uncertainty by using the data. The lemma also shows that the mean of the posterior distribution is the prior mean updated by the gain applied to the difference between the observed Y and its mean value H mu. Recall that the difference between an observed quantity and its temporal mean is called \"anomaly\" in climate science, so this concept arises naturally in Bayesian data assimilation.\nks7m | Twenty point three point one . Example: Bayesian Approach\nw1w1 | We return to the example introduced in Section Twenty point two. Assume that X sub one follows normal distribution with mean mu zero, variance sigma squared, where mu zero and sigma squared are known. Then the column vector X equals X sub one to X sub four of process variables has a multivariate normal distribution X follows normal distribution with mean vector mu equals open parenthesis omega zero, alpha mu zero, alpha squared mu zero, alpha cubed mu zero close parenthesis transpose and a suitable covariance matrix Sigma. This is the prior distribution F sub X on X. It does not use any observations. Explicitly,",
