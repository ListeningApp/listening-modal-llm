You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

cq4s | We find in our sample a heavy reliance on carrots. To induce executives to cooperate in selling their firms, VCs frequently offer sale bonuses. In 16 of the 50 firms, VCs pay an average sale bonus of $1.63 million. In 11 of 50 firms, VCs give common shareholders as a class an average of $3.7 million extra. In 45% of the firms, VCs give at least one type of carrot, with these carrots on average amounting to 9% of the deal's value. Across all 50 firms in our sample, an average of 4.3% of deal value-2.4% on a dollar-weighted basis-is used to fund these two types of carrots: sale bonuses and carve-outs to common.21
wot7 | We also find some use of sticks, such as threats to blacklist founders who refuse to cooperate and attempts to undermine common shareholders' voting rights. But the overt use of these sticks is relatively infrequent. And although 60% of the founders in our firms are replaced before the sale, we find no evidence that VCs fired or threatened to fire founders to ease the sales of firms.
iora | Our study makes three important contributions to the literature. First, it sheds light on an important but underexplored aspect of corporate governance in private, VC-backed firms. In particular, it highlights the potentially divergent interests of different players in VC-backed firms around trade-sale exits and shows that VCs frequently must overcome potential opposition to these sales.
h9b8 | Second, our study provides additional evidence that managers of a target firm can extract value by holding up a sale of the firm. Researchers have reported on the use of side payments to executives in the sale of publicly traded firms.22 We show that such "bribes" are used not only in public firms with dispersed ownership but also in closely held private firms.
bmnm | Third, our study provides some evidence on whether VCs are constrained from abusing their power in startups. The relatively infrequent use of sticks in our sample supports the view that reputational or other nonlegal considerations substantially constrain (but do not completely prevent) sharp-elbowed behavior by VCs in Silicon Valley.23
qesj | The remainder of the Article is structured as follows: Part I describes the typical structure of VC cash-flow and exit-facilitating control rights in startup firms. Part II explains why founders, other executives, and common shareholders may wish to impede a trade sale as well as the means they have
ddaf | CARROTS AND STICKS
1eh9 | to do so. Part III describes the carrots and sticks that VCs may use to overcome such resistance. Part IV presents our dataset. Part V describes the carrots and sticks actually used by VCs in our sample.

yrsq | VCS' CASH-FLOW AND CONTROL RIGHTS
gtej | A. VCs' Cash-Flow Rights
cs35 | In the United States, VC-backed startups almost always issue two classes of stock: common and convertible preferred.24 The founders and employees of the startup hold the common stock.25 The convertible preferred stock is held by the VCs, who invest in startups almost exclusively through this type of security.26 Most venture-backed startups issue a new series of preferred stock for each round of financing.27
qm1o | Like most preferred stock, VCs' preferred shares carry a liquidation preference and are convertible into common stock.28 If VCs retain their preferred stock and preserve their liquidation preferences, those preferences must be satisfied before common shareholders receive any payment. In this scenario, the VCs' cash-flow rights resemble debt.29 If the VCs convert their preferred shares to common, giving up their liquidation preferences, the VCs have the same cash-flow rights as common shareholders.30 Thus, convertible

1iir | preferred stock combines downside protection with upside potential.
fpmr | In a trade sale, the VCs will choose whether to exit as preferred shareholders and reap the benefits of their liquidation preferences or to exit as common shareholders. If the VCs exit via an IPO, underwriters will typically insist that the VCs convert their preferred shares to common shares and give up their liquidation preferences along with other rights attached to the preferred stock. To prevent holdouts, a startup's charter will, with respect to the holders of each series of preferred stock, generally either (a) require all of the holders of that series to convert to common stock or (b) allow a majority of the holders of that series to forcibly convert all holders of that series to common stock.31 Thus, one way or the other, VCs in IPO firms will typically exit as common shareholders.
7f3y | B. VCs' Exit-Facilitating Control Rights
g7we | To exit their investment, VCs must arrange an IPO, trade sale, or dissolution of the firm. Below, we describe the two types of control rights most relevant to facilitating an exit: (1) the right to fill seats on the board of directors and (2) shareholder-voting rights.32
cmmw | 1. Board Seats
f6og | The board of directors is responsible for managing the day-to-day business and affairs of the company.33 Critically, the board is also the only corporate body that can initiate fundamental transactions, such as mergers, IPOs, and dissolutions.34 These transactions, in turn, are almost always
rgb8 | CARROTS AND STICKS
1m13 | necessary for the VCs to exit; hence, we will call them "VC exit transactions." Thus, VC exit transactions-including trade sales-cannot go forward without board approval. But, as we will see, board approval alone is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.
glst | The board, in turn, is elected-and can be replaced-by the shareholders.35 In the typical public company, default statutory-voting rules give the holder of each share one vote for each open board seat.36 By contrast, in a VC-backed firm, the parties typically negotiate a voting agreement that overrides default statutory voting rules.37 The agreement specifies the allocation of board seats among: (1) representatives of the common shareholders; (2) representatives of the VC investors; and (3) so-called "independent" directors, who are mutually appointed by the common shareholders and the VCs and typically are industry experts or other outsiders with valuable experience and connections.38
4ufy | Because board approval is necessary for VC exits, VCs negotiate aggressively for board seats when investing in startups.39 While data on board composition in private, VC-backed firms are scarce, two persistent patterns emerge from various small-scale studies of VC contracting documents and VC-backed firms. First, VC board representation tends to increase with new financing rounds, especially outside rounds that bring in new VCs.40 Second, in a plurality of firms, neither common shareholders nor VC-appointed directors ever achieve outright control; the swing vote remains in the hands of an independent director.41 Keeping the swing vote in the hands of an independent director makes it more difficult for either the common shareholders or the preferred shareholders to act opportunistically with respect to the other class of shareholders.42 But as one of us has argued in
rx7v | CARROTS AND STICKS
brvl | other work, these studies (and the outwardly neutral appearance of independent directors) may understate the extent of de facto VC control over startup boards.43
0aci | 2. Shareholder Rights
5vxd | As noted above, for VCs seeking an exit transaction, board approval is not sufficient. Shareholder approval is also necessary.
