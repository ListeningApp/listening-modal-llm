You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

By moving from a problem orien- tation toward a more rigorous and disciplined focus on essential questions, the organization is slowly shifting from a "fix-it" mode to an inquiry model for business and organizational strategy evolution.This company has found that maintaining a rigorous focus on "questions that matter" and hosting strategic conversations on the organization's "big questions" is a core competence for leaders at all levels.
u5ug | How Can Leaders Engage Powerful Questions?
i9k5 | For all organizations, in today's turbulent times, engag- ing people's best thinking about complex issues with- out easy answers will be the key to creating the futures we want rather than being forced to live with the futures we get. Leaders will need to develop capacity in the design of "inquiring systems" in order to learn, adapt, and create new knowledge to meet emerging opportunities and challenges in the more fluid organi- zational structures of the future. For example, the lead- ership challenges of the next 20 years are likely to revolve around the art of engaging and energizing net- works rather than solely managing hierarchies as in the past. Successful leaders will be those who see organiza- tions as living networks of conversation and collective meaning-making through which members create new knowledge and bring forth the future. They will under- stand how to operate in networks that are both internal and external to their organization.
20z2 | In particular, we believe the following core capa- bilities, rarely taught in today's MBA or corporate lead- ership programs, will help define leadership excel- lence in a networked world where knowledge and learning are keys to success:
4cgs | Engaging Strategic Questions. How many lead- ers today know how to frame strategic questions that open the space for thinking about possibilities rather than solving problems? How many leaders are com- fortable with not knowing and can constructively help others bring forth their collective knowledge? How many leaders can engage their workers in dis- covering the "big questions" that lie at the heart of their organization's future?
htre | In a volatile and uncertain environment, one of the strongest steps leaders can take is to assist their organ- izations in discovering the right questions at the right time. One of their key responsibilities is creating infra- structures for dialogue and engagement that encourage others at all levels to develop insightful questions and to search for innovative paths forward. Leaders also need to consider reward systems that provide incen- tives for members to work across organizational bound- aries to discover those challenging lines of inquiry that create common focus and new knowledge.
da3c | Convening and Hosting Learning Conver- sations. A core aspect of the leader's new work involves creating multiple opportunities for learning conversations around challenging questions.
890q | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
jomo | However, authentic conversation is less likely to occur in a climate of fear, mistrust, and hierarchical control. When the human mind and heart are fully engaged in authentic conversation and listening for core ques- tions, new knowledge often begins to surface. Thus, the ability to facilitate working conversations that enhance trust and reduce fear is an important leader- ship capability.
06fi | To succeed in this pursuit, it's essential for leaders to strengthen their skills in the use of dialogue and other engagement approaches that deepen mutual inquiry and foster collective intelligence. These capa- bilities include:
hb4s | · Creating a climate of discovery
cqq2 | · Suspending premature judgment
1ews | · Exploring underlying assumptions and beliefs
afyn | · Listening for connections between ideas
8sye | · Encouraging diverse perspectives
r04h | • Honoring everyone's contributions
orpr | · Articulating shared understanding
k36m | • Harvesting and sharing collective discoveries
wnuz | These skills are especially important in situations in which there are no simple answers and finding cre- ative paths forward can make a positive difference.
sy14 | Including Diverse Perspectives. Leaders must become connectors-of both people and ideas. Diverse voices and new perspectives that aren't limited by traditional boundaries of function, hierarchy, discipline, technology, tenure, and geograph- ic region play an increasingly important role in a company's strategizing.As Gary Hamel of the London School of Economics points out, "Strategizing depends on creating a rich and complex web of conversations that cuts across previously isolated pockets of knowl- edge and creates new and unexpected combinations of insight."
ghss | The connections among these diverse voices and perspectives allow employees to fruitfully explore critical strategic questions. Building and encouraging personal relationships through networks of collabora- tive conversations across traditional boundaries helps critical strategic questions travel well. In this way, workers enhance their collective intelligence and their capacity to nurture creative futures together.
3s61 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
s3rm | Supporting Appreciative Inquiry. Opening spaces of possibility in our organizations requires a shift in leadership orientation from focusing primari- ly on what is not working and how to fix it, to also dis- covering and appreciating what is working and how to leverage it. Appreciative Inquiry (AI), developed by David Cooperrider and his colleagues at Case Western University, is a process for leveraging emerging possi- bilities rather than just fixing past mistakes. When used in a disciplined way, this kind of inquiry stimu- lates lively conversations that use the best of what is as the foundation for what might be.
pqxb | Leaders who ask, "What's possible here and who cares?" have a much easier time gaining the coopera- tion and best thinking of their constituents than those who ask, "What's wrong here and who is to blame?" In assessing the results of more than a decade of research and practice in the area of Appreciative Inquiry, Cooperrider has stated unequivocal- ly that "the most important insight we have learned with AI to date is that human systems grow toward what they persistently ask questions about." By asking positive questions, organizations have the opportunity to grow in new directions and tap innovative sources of knowledge, vitality, and energy.
08qc | Fostering Shared Meaning. We make meaning of our experiences through stories, images, and metaphors. To tap into this pool of shared meaning, which is the ground from which both powerful ques- tions and innovative solutions emerge, network leaders need to put time and attention into framing common language and developing shared images and metaphors. They can do so by constructing compelling scenarios- stories of the future-that provide a context for work- ing on today's "big questions," as in the case of the Game Plan process described earlier. In addition, leaders must
