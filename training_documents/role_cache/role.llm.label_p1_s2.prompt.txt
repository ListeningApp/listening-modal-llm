You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

936l | Summary
06yq | Retention of flesh texture attributes during cold storage is critical for the long-term maintenance of fruit quality. The genetic variations determining flesh firmness and crispness retainability are not well understood. The objectives of this study are to identify gene markers based on quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and to develop genomics-assisted prediction (GAP) models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability. Phenotype data of 2664 hybrids derived from three Malus domestica cultivars and a M. asiatica cultivar were collected in 2016 and 2017. The phenotype segregated considerably with high broad-sense heritability of 83.85% and 83.64% for flesh firmness and crispness retainability, respectively. Fifty-six candidate genes were predicted from the 62 QTLs identified using bulked segregant analysis and RNA-seq. The genotype effects of the markers designed on each candidate gene were estimated. The genomics-predicted values were obtained using pyramiding marker genotype effects and overall mean phenotype values. Fivefold cross-validation revealed that the prediction accuracy was 0.5541 and 0.6018 for retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. An 8-bp deletion in the MdERF3 promoter disrupted MdDOF5.3 binding, reduced MdERF3 expression, relieved the inhibition on MdPGLR3, MdPME2, and MdACO4 expression, and ultimately decreased flesh firmness and crispness retainability. A 3-bp deletion in the MdERF118 promoter decreased its expression by disrupting the binding of MdRAVL1, which increased MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression and reduced flesh firmness and crispness retainability. These results provide insights regarding the genetic variation network regulating flesh firmness and crispness retainability, and the GAP models can assist in apple breeding.

8r5j | Introduction
2taz | Fruit softening after ripening is important for plant survival and reproduction. However, optimal flesh firmness and crispness are important fruit quality traits determining consumer choice. The retention of these texture attributes during cold storage is critical for long-term maintenance of fruit quality (Bonany et al., 2014; Grammen et al., 2019; Nybom et al., 2008; Yue et al., 2013). Although many quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified and several genes have been reported to be involved in fruit storability, molecular insights regarding fruit firmness and crisp- ness retention are currently limited (Eriksson et al., 2004; Janssen et al., 2008; Marín-Rodríguez et al., 2003; Rose et al., 2002; Segonne et al., 2014; Soglio et al., 2009).
o3ya | Fruit firmness and crispness are quantitatively inherited and are genetically controlled by polygenes with minor effects. In apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), a number of QTLs for fruit firmness and flesh texture were repeatedly mapped on chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17, which explained 10-49% phenotypic variance (Bink et al., 2014; García-Gómez et al., 2019; King et al.,

tzt3 | 2001; Longhi et al., 2012). A set of diagnostic markers have been converted from QTL-based markers via candidate gene prediction and variation validation (García-Gómez et al., 2019; Leng et al., 2017; Mason et al., 2018; Vanderzande et al., 2018).
t8vv | Post-harvest fruit softening, which counteracts flesh firmness and crispness retention, is a complex physiological process involving the biosynthesis of or response to phytohormones and the degradation of cytoskeletons such as polysaccharide (Marondedze and Thomas, 2012; Xu et al., 2018). Ethylene biosynthesis is generally considered a primary factor leading to fruit softening. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) are the two well-studied ethylene production-related genes. QTL-based markers on MdACO1 and MdACS1 have been shown to be responsible for apple fruit firmness and shelf life (Costa et al., 2010; Costa et al., 2005a; Harada et al., 2000; Oraguzie et al., 2007). However, the markers on MdACS1 and MdACO1 explained only 8.3-11.4% of phenotype variance, indicating that other genes may contribute to the overall effect of low ethylene production in certain apple lines (Colgan et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2010).
qvnu | The rapid increase in internal ethylene concentration triggers the transition from the initial slow softening phase to the rapid softening phase in apple (Johnston et al., 2001). A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker on polygalactur- onase gene MdPG1 (explains up to 10.7% phenotypic variance) was developed from a QTL for fruit post-harvest firmness (Costa et al., 2010). Flesh firmness loss is usually associated with mealiness. The MdPG1 also contributed most to apple flesh mealiness (Moriya et al., 2017). A significant locus spanning pectin methylesterase (MdPME) was associated with apple fruit crispness and mealiness in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Amyotte et al., 2017). Apples of cultivar 'Scifresh' soften slowly because of the relatively low MdPME and MdPG activities throughout fruit development and ripening (Ng et al., 2013, 2014).
kggw | In addition to the genes for ethylene biosynthesis and pectin degradation, many transcription factors are involved in fine controlling fruit firmness and crispness. Ethylene response factors, MdERF2 and MdERF3 (XM_008339725, should be MdERF1A in NCBI), bind to the MdACS1 promoter and oppositely regulate its transcription during post-harvest ripening in apple (Li et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the genetic regulatory network mediated by these genes and the relationship between them were not clear.
xrd1 | In the last decade, empirical marker-assisted selection (MAS) for apple crispness has been practically used in breeding programmes, enabling breeders to design the perfect hybrid cross and to select the best seedlings from large populations (Laurens et al., 2018; Lezzoni et al., 2016; Peace et al., 2019). Breeders have noticed that the efficiency of MAS is often not satisfactory for traits involving many loci with minor effects. Genomic selection (GS) emerged as an innovative paradigm twenty years ago in animal breeding and was soon adopted and rapidly studied in fruit plants (Biscarini et al., 2017; Gois et al., 2016; Imai et al., 2018; Iwata et al., 2013, 2016; Kumar et al., 2019). In apple, GS or genomic prediction was pioneered by Kumar et al. (2012a, 2012b) and has been used in simulative selections for fruit quality traits, harvest date, and scab resistance (Kumar et al., 2012a, 2012b; McClure et al., 2018; Muranty et al., 2015; Peace et al., 2019).
5746 | Pure GS estimates additive effects and neglects non-additive allelic effects and non-allelic epistasis (Muranty et al., 2015). For outcrossing species, these non-additive effects were, however, important for the improvement of various traits. A hierarchical epistasis of MdSAUR37/MdPP2CH/MdALMTII was identified to control fruit malate content (Jia et al., 2018). To link MAS and GS, an additive Bayesian QTL analyses model was developed for apple fruit firmness, the GS accuracy (0.57-0.94) was higher than that of genomic best linear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP) model (0.72-0.77) (Bink et al., 2014). These data drew attention to QTL- based GS, which is sometimes called genomics-assisted prediction (GAP) (Peace et al., 2019). Compared with map-based QTL mapping and GWAS, bulked segregant analysis via sequencing (BSA-seq) is considered as a cost-efficient QTL detection approach and has been effectively used in apple (Shen et al., 2019).
7toz | The objective of the present study was to develop GAP models for flesh firmness and crispness retainability. Towards this, QTLs were identified from three apple F1 hybrid populations using BSA-seq approach. To convert significant QTL-based markers to diagnostic markers, candidate genes were predicted from QTL intervals, assisted by using RNA-seq and parental re-sequencing. Then, the allelic variations in candidate genes were validated to confirm the function of the variations. The results can facilitate

h2l3 | Segregation and correlation of flesh firmness or crispness at harvest and post-harvest
dfzb | Both the initial flesh firmness and the crispness of apples at harvest segregated extensively with a Gaussian distribution within the three populations, implying a minor-effect polygenic control of these two traits (Figure S1). The broad-sense heritability <LATEX>\left( H ^ { 2 } \right)</LATEX> was 75.24-83.06% and 86.91-94.43% for the initial flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Table S1). Similarly, the <LATEX>H ^ { 2 }</LATEX> was 75.04-83.85% and 75.87-83.64% for retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Table S1). However, the frequency distributions of retainability of flesh firmness and crispness were not Gaussian (Figure S2). The majority of hybrids lost flesh firmness and crispness within one or two months. The frequency of hybrids with long flesh firmness (≥7 kg/cm2) and crispness (≥0.7 kg/cm2) retainability was higher in the population of 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji' than the other two (Figure S2).
u6ty | The Pearson's correlation coefficient was highest between flesh crispness and firmness retainability (0.8024; n = 2,651; <LATEX>\left. P < 0 . 0 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> followed by that between initial flesh firmness and crispness (0.5892; <LATEX>n = 2 , 5 0 7 ;</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. P < 0 . 0 0 1 \right)</LATEX> (Figure 1a). The cor- relations between the initial flesh firmness or crispness at harvest and the corresponding flesh firmness or crispness retainability after cold storage were relatively low (0.3392- 0.4692) (Figure 1a). The hybrids with long flesh firmness retainability did not generally have the same or longer flesh crispness retainability (Figure 1b). Among the 217 hybrids with 6-7 months long flesh firmness retainability, 140 (64.5%) had the same or longer flesh crispness retainability (Figure 1b). However, among the 157 hybrids with six months or longer flesh crispness retainability, 140 (89.2%) showed 6-7 months flesh firmness retainability (Figure 1b). These data indicated that long retainability of flesh firmness was likely a prerequisite for flesh crispness retainability.
awvu | Pattern of flesh firmness and crispness at harvest and post-harvest
on9b | Regarding the changes in flesh firmness and crispness during cold storage, three extremity dynamics were distinctly observed. Type I: acceptable flesh firmness (7.0 kg/cm2) or crispness (0.7 kg/cm2) lost already at harvest. Type II: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained until the sixth month after a rapid softening during the first month of cold storage. Type III: acceptable flesh firmness or crispness maintained after the sixth months of cold storage with constantly slow softening rate (Figure 1c,d). Ethylene production in type I hybrids was higher than that in types II and III during cold storage, whereas type III hybrids produced lowest level of ethylene (Figure 1e,f). These suggested that low ethylene emission was associated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability.
a8ge | QTL identification using BSA-seq
h27a | By the three segregant bulks from the three phenotype types of flesh firmness retainability (Figure S3a), 10, 5 and 17 significant QTLs for flesh firmness retainability were identified from bulk pairs of type III vs. type I, type III vs. type II, and type II vs. type I, respectively. These QTLs were located on chromosomes 3, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 17 (Figure S4a,b,c; Table S2). Of these QTLs, F-F03.2
