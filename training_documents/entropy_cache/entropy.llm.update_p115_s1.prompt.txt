You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

j5ke | In A3 + 1 + ~ 1 NA3
xe0y | To impress our friends we can convert this to bits: we divide by ln 2 and get about
gjl6 | 0.69315 ~ 21.700
81i9 | bits of unknown information per atom of helium.
kgrb | I've kept only 5 significant figures in the later stages of these calculations, since that's how precise the experimental data is. Next let's compare the final result to experiment!
6g0d | THE ENTROPY OF HELIUM: EXPERIMENT
k9u1 | The entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure has been measured to be 126.15 joules/kelvin per mole.
ldrv | One bit of unknown information per atom corresponds to about 5.7631 joule/kelvin of entropy per mole.
li40 | Thus, each atom of helium at standard temperature and pressure carries about 126.15
irr1 | ~ 21.889
svwi | bits of unknown information.
cym3 | Experimentally, the entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure is 126.15 joules/kelvin per mole. Converting this to bits per atom we get 21.889, very close to our theoretical result of 21.700, but about 0.9% higher.
7y4b | There are a couple of possible reasons for this slight discrepancy. First, while our theoretical calculation assumed that helium is an ideal gas of noninteracting point particles, this is not true. The helium atoms interact!
421l | Second, our computation ignored quantum effects-except for using Planck's con- stant to determine the thermal wavelength. Even for an ideal gas, quantum effects become important when V/NA3 ceases to be large. This happens at high densities V/N, low temperatures T, or for particles of small mass m. Helium has a low mass as molecules of gas go-and our ultimate goal, hydrogen, is even worse.
art6 | Now let's tackle the final summit: hydrogen. This is a diatomic gas, so it works differently.
psk5 | THE IDEAL DIATOMIC GAS
atv6 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical ideal diatomic gas of N indistinguishable molecules of mass m in a 3-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy
9ja4 | 5 (E) = kNT
bl6w | and free energy
rxoj | F = - kT In N! A3N 1 VN
b2rk | where A = h/V2zmkT is the thermal wavelength.
pros | Its entropy S is ((E) - F)/T, so EN IMA3 + 2) -
tlrm | - kln N!
6gxm | and using Stirling's formula In N! ~ (In N - 1) N we get S & kN EN (In MA3+3) NA3
7eaf | It's easy to repeat our computation of entropy for a diatomic gas if we recall that the tumbling of the molecules add two degrees of freedom to the three for position, giving (E) = 2kNT. Tracking the effects of this change we see the entropy is higher than for a monatomic gas. To be precise, the entropy of a classical ideal diatomic gas is
t890 | ~ EN (In MAS+2) . NA3
nwqa | So, it has one more nat of Shannon entropy per molecule than an ideal monatomic gas! Let's see how this plays out for hydrogen.
sewa | THE ENTROPY OF HYDROGEN: THEORY
0tlp | Assuming hydrogen is a classical ideal diatomic gas, its entropy is
bz3j | EN (In NAS +2) NA3
14mv | which corresponds to
75iu | ln NA3 V + 7
a82u | nats of unknown information per molecule. At standard temperature and pressure, this gives 15.144 nats or
tx0t | ln 2 15.144
2zty | ~21.848
63ho | bits of unknown information per molecule.
32zi | A hydrogen molecule has m = 3.34706 . 10-27 kg, so at a temperature T = 298.15 K its thermal wavelength is
59si | 6.62607 . 10-34 Js
i30e | ≈ 2TT X 3.34706 · 10-27 kg × 1.380649 · 10-23 J/K x 298.15 K
tvst | ~ 7.12156 . 10-11 m.
wrky | For a mole of an ideal gas at standard temperature and pressure, N = 6.02214076 . 1023 and V ~ 0.0247896 m3, so
2my1 | ~ 113971 NA3 V ≈ 6.02214076 . 1023 x (7.12156 . 10-11 m) 3 0.0247896 m3
8ql6 | We thus have
07fv | ln NA3 V ~ In 113971 ~ 11.644
kg0h | Thanks to our previous work we know this means that that the logarithm of the number of accessible states of each molecule would be 11.644 if it were trapped in its own small box of volume V/N. There is also a correction to this simplified picture due to density fluctuations, which gives 1 extra nat of entropy. These add up to give the free energy contribution to the entropy per molecule: 12.644 nats. This is less than we got for helium. But the expected energy contribution to the entropy per molecule is larger: we again get 2 nats from the molecule's 3 momentum degrees of freedom,
pl1f | but now we get 1 extra nat due to its 2 extra tumbling degrees of freedom. The total number of nats of unknown information per hydrogen molecule is thus
wavb | <LATEX>\ln \frac { V } { N \Lambda ^ { 3 } } + 1 + \frac { 3 } { 2 } + 1 \approx 1 5 . 1 4 4 .</LATEX> Finally, the number of bits of unknown information per hydrogen molecule is
at1i | <LATEX>\frac { 1 5 . 1 4 4 } { 0 . 6 9 3 1 5 } \approx 2 1 . 8 4 8 .</LATEX> This is slightly more than for helium, where the number was 21.700.
4dbf | As a sanity check, let's do this calculation a different way. A hydrogen molecule is close to half the mass of a helium atom, so its thermal wavelength should be <LATEX>\sqrt { 2 }</LATEX> times as large. In our calculation we're treating <LATEX>V / N</LATEX> as the same for both gases, so hydrogen's <LATEX>V / N \Lambda ^ { 3 }</LATEX> should be <LATEX>2 ^ { - 3 / 2 }</LATEX> times as large as that for helium. Since ultimately we compute bits by taking a logarithm in base 2, this reduces its entropy per molecule by <LATEX>3 / 2</LATEX> bits. However, hydrogen's 2 tumbling degrees of freedom increase its entropy per molecule by 1 nat, or <LATEX>1 / \ln 2</LATEX> bits. We have
nsky | <LATEX>- \frac { 3 } { 2 } + \frac { 1 } { \ln 2 } \approx - 1 . 5 + 1 . 4 4 3 \approx - 0 . 0 5 7 .</LATEX> This suggests that each hydrogen molecule should carry 0.057 fewer bits of unknown information than each helium atom. Why did our more careful calculation say hydrogen should have about
pa2d | <LATEX>2 1 . 8 4 8 - 2 1 . 7 0 0 \approx 0 . 1 4 8</LATEX> more bits of unknown information per molecule? What's the mistake?
