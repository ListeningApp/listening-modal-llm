        "content": "j30a | Like the Federalist language reformer Noah Webster, Morse sought to achieve a degree of national identity by aligning the overall practices of alphabetic training with geographical knowledge. Given the programmatic rethinking of elementary literacy instruction, the map became a product of alphabetic learning. Indeed, as the basic principles of literacy (the alphabet, representational sign systems, phonetics) became imbricated with basic principles of geography (notions of place, systems of measurement, taxonomic organization), the conventional words and verbal text were perceived through a geographic consciousness. By prefacing\n\n7bdk | his textbook with a map of the new nation-state, Morse invariably coupled the map reader's desire for visual self-location to the textbook's otherwise verbal representation of political identities. Students following the reading protocol of the textbook map, then, learned not only to privilege the geographic dimension of the nation-state over representations of local places but also to superimpose the cartographic signs representing the union over the textbook's alphabetic notations describing the states. Thus, while Webster relied on the national map to Americanize the spelling and pronunciation of English words, Morse's map-reading lesson transformed the study of geography into a nationalistic spelling bee.\n\nfim0 | Federalists like Webster and Morse who used the rhetoric of the national map operated inside an established cartographic tradition in which maps had historically accompanied the creation of national ideologies. Ever since Abraham Ortelius and Gerard Mercator published their world maps and atlases in the sixteenth century, single-sheet maps had presented the sovereign states as visually and territorially unified constructs. During the eighteenth century, the wealthier European nation-states had sponsored or were about to initiate the production of national maps. Developing out of the discourses of property surveys and regional mapping projects, the national map served a dual function. First, in the mapmaking process, surveyors left visible markers on the land (such as boundary markers and border crossings). Second, the map image as a material artifact provided a visual proxy and reproducible evidence of the nation's territorial, optically organic, and demonstrably material existence.\n\nojro | \n\nl6t9 | \n\n1ujy | In the first decades of the United States' existence, the image of the national map was one of the few visual artifacts demonstrating what many perceived to be either an abstract or even untenable fiction, namely that there could be a national union between disjointed regions and politically disparate people. Unlike in Europe, where governments controlled the output of national maps, in the United States the national map quickly became the dual product of the federal government and the private economic sector. On the one hand, the federal government sponsored the production of national maps on two occasions. The passage of the Land Ordinance Acts of seventeen eighty-five and seventeen eighty-seven anticipated a burst of mapmaking activities as it launched a national survey. The copyright law of seventeen ninety, which was advertised on the inside of every book printed in the United States as \"an Act securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books,\" protected maps by giving them the status of a preferred commodity.\n\nqzor | On the other hand, the appearance of a state-regulated distribution of national maps would be misleading because the majority of maps and other geographical writings were produced by private individuals and small commercial publishers. The new citizens were most likely to encounter the image of the nation by reading inexpensive, small-scale maps, like the one inserted in Morse's school geography. The map image of the United States proliferated significantly when publishers like Mathew Carey of Philadelphia included national maps in various book genres and through multiple packaging reduced significantly the average price per map. According to Carey's sales catalog of seventeen ninety-five, single-sheet maps sold for as little as twelve and a half cents (by comparison, the folio edition of the American Atlas, containing twenty-one maps, was priced at five dollars-six if \"colored\"). These numbers show that single-sheet maps rather than map collections were affordable texts and as such quickly absorbed into the nation's cultural landscape.\n\na0by | Indeed, the national map permeated American material culture in many and unexpected places. For example, after the Revolution families like that of Mrs. Noah Smith not only displayed their material belongings (and thus good taste) when they posed for portraits but opted to have the\n\nu1ky | map of the United States close to the portrait's center to better demonstrate their new Americanness (Figure thirty-three). Considering the domestic habit of putting maps on display inside private settings, the national map in all likelihood decorated the walls of American homes (Figure thirty-four). The nation's map image certainly became a pedagogic piece of furniture in schools. It was a fundamental part of textbooks, globes, and wall decorations. Teachers and parents even experimented with the cognitive function of the national map by integrating it into didactic puzzles (Figure thirty-five). Once we leave the domestic and institutional spaces of the home and the school, we discover that the nation's cartographic shape hung on rollers or under glass in public places. Wall maps were displayed in public offices and coffeehouses; as the genre painting Barroom Dancing by John Lewis Krimmel shows, the national map was displayed in taverns, where it functioned as decoration, conversation piece, and metaphoric touchstone of communal identity (Figure thirty-six).\n\nhtm9 | A spate of American-made atlases greatly popularized the image of the nation-state. Beginning with the publication of Mathew Carey's American Atlas (seventeen ninety-five), four more national atlases almost simultaneously captured the public eye: Carey's General Atlas (seventeen ninety-six), Carey's American Pocket Atlas (seventeen ninety-six), Joseph T. Scott's Atlas of the United States (seventeen ninety-six), and John Reid's American Atlas (seventeen ninety-six). Each of these atlases privileged the national map. While the atlas as a printed form imitated the generic design of a book, the map showing the territory of the United States often functioned like a table of contents or prefatory chapter. Placed in this position, the national map more than introduced the states; in most cases it emphasized national unity over state autonomy.",
