You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

1o7p | shows the stress dependency of the friction angle at failure for isotropic NC specimens. It has been found that the stress de- pendency of Quiou sand is larger than that of Toyoura and Ticino sands. In particular, the friction angle of Quiou sand decreases rapidly with an increase in the confining pressure. This is because the crushability of Quiou sand is higher than that of other sands. Therefore, the n-value of Quiou sand de- creased for

bgre | The secant modulus decrease with an increase in the strain level is more pronounced in <LATEX>K _ { 0 }</LATEX> consolidated <LATEX>\left( K _ { 0 } \mathrm { C } \right)</LATEX> specimens than in isotropic consolidated (IC) specimens, as mentioned before.
57lp | It has been shown that the secant Young's modulus was significantly dependent on overconsolidation history. Fig. 11 shows the variations of normalized secant Young's modulus Esec/[S.F(e)o Wpa-"], with respect to OCR, as examined using a single logarithmic scale at several strain levels for IC Toy- oura, Quiou and Ticino sand specimens. From this figure, it has been found that the effects of overconsolidation history on the secant Young's modulus for Quiou sand are larger than those for Toyoura and Ticino sands.
ukth | Figs. 12(a-c) show the typical relations of the secant mod- ulus normalized by void ratio function and confining pressure versus log(&a) to better clarify the effect of the overconsoli- dation on the secant modulus for the three IC and K0C sand specimens, respectively. In these figures, the normalized secant
kpvt | modulus for isotropic and K0 normally consolidated specimens were indicated by the Sy-value or a X Sy-value in (3) and (4), respectively. Fig. 13 shows the variation of the K0-value after consolidation, due to the difference in the overconsolidation ratio.
jie2 | It can be seen that the strain level at which the reduction of Esec in OC specimens occurs is larger than that in NC speci- mens. It can be also seen that the sudden reduction of Esec in OC specimens that occurs for &a is larger than about 0.05% for all sands. In addition, it is found that the reduction ten- dency of Esec is relatively similar for isotropic and K0 OC spec- imens for the same OCR. This is because (1) the yield locus (the linear threshold strain) expanded because of the overcon- solidation history; and (2) the K0-value of the OC specimen increases with an increase in the overconsolidation ratio, as shown in Fig. 13.

It has been found that the effects of the overconsolidation history for Toyoura sand are negligibly small at small strain levels. The effects of the OC history on the secant modulus are greatest at <LATEX>E _ { c } ,</LATEX> around 0.05 to 0.1%. The effects of the OC history are similar on Toyoura and Ti- cino sands. On the other hand, the effects of OC history on Quiou sand are much larger than for other sands. This can be seen because the soil particle crush of Quiou sand had signif- icantly progressed because of the OC history and shearing.
4exe | It has also been found that the effects of OC history on <LATEX>K _ { 0 } C</LATEX> specimens are larger than those on IC specimens. This is be- cause (1) the secant Young's modulus of <LATEX>K _ { 0 }</LATEX> specimens is smaller than that of the <LATEX>I C</LATEX> specimen, except that at small strain levels under the same vertical consolidation stress, as shown in Fig. 12, and (2) the K0-value increases with an increase in OCR, as shown in Fig. 13. Consequently, the effects of OC history on the secant Young's modulus of the <LATEX>K _ { 0 } C</LATEX> specimen were larger than those of the IC specimens.
0myz | CONCLUSIONS
xh3i | This paper presents the analysis of a large number of drained triaxial compression tests, many of which were carried out with local strain measurement. The tests were performed on both isotropically and anisotropically consolidated speci- mens of three sands prepared by pluvial deposition in air and allow the following conclusions, all of which refer to the value of sand moduli at
syiw | <LATEX>\sigma _ { w } ^ { \prime } = 1 0 0 k P a :</LATEX> 1. For all three sands, the secant Young's modulus normal- ized with respect to the consolidation void ratio exhibits very pronounced degradation with increasing strain.
kg3t | 2. Nonlinearity starts to show when the axial strain exceeds <LATEX>\approx 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }</LATEX> and <LATEX>5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 2 } \%</LATEX> for NC and OC with OCR <LATEX>= 3</LATEX> specimens, respectively.
lvae | 3. Below such a strain level, which corresponds to the lin- ear threshold strain, the secant Young's modulus coin- cides with the initial tangent stiffness <LATEX>\left( E _ { 0 } \right) ,</LATEX> which de- pends only on the magnitude of <LATEX>\sigma _ { v } ^ { \prime }</LATEX> being independent of
o9sc | <LATEX>\sigma _ { b } ^ { \prime } .</LATEX> 4. For silica Ticino and Toyoura sands, the <LATEX>E _ { \mathrm { c } }</LATEX> results were found to be independent of OCR, while in carbonatic Quiou sands it moderately influences the magnitude of the initial stiffness.
121u | 5. Beyond the linear threshold strain, the reduction of <LATEX>E _ { \sec }</LATEX> for normally consolidated specimens can be matched by the empirical fitting formulae.
