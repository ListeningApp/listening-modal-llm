If it is for the covariate then this variable has a significant relationship to the outcome variable; if it is for the independent variable then the means (adjusted for the effect of the covariate) are significantly different across categories of this variable.\n2nib | · If you have generated specific hypotheses before the experiment use planned contrasts; if not, use post hoc tests.\nnaev | · For parameters and post hoc tests, look at the columns labelled Sig. to discover if your comparisons are significant (they will be if the significance value is less than zero point zero five). Use bootstrapping to get robust versions of these tests.\n7h0h | · In addition to the assumptions in Chapter six, test for homogeneity of regression slopes by customizing the model to look at the independent variable × covariate interaction.\na64c | We have already looked at robust confidence intervals and p-values for the model parameters that were computed using bootstrapping and heteroscedasticity robust standard errors. In addition, the companion website contains a syntax file for running a robust variant of ANCOVA that works on trimmed means and is described by Wilcox. We need the Essentials for R plugin and W R S two package installed. This test is limited to the situation where the independent variable (the categorical predictor) has two categories and there is one covariate. But it does enable you to ignore assumptions and get on with your life. Because this syntax only works when you have two groups, I have provided a data file called Puppies Two Group, which contains the example data for\ngi7n | this chapter but excluding the fifteen-minute condition, so it compares the control (no puppies) with the thirty-minute group (Dose), and has the scores for the love of puppies covariate too (Puppy_love). The syntax to run the robust test is as follows: BEGIN PROGRAM R.\n3pn1 | library(WRS2)\nwjuz | mySPSSdata = spssdata.GetDataFromSPSS(factorMode = \"labels\") ancboot(Happiness ~ Dose + Puppy_love, data = mySPSSdata, tr = zero point two, nboot = one thousand) END PROGRAM.\n3yxv | Select and run these five lines of syntax. As Output shows, the test works by identifying values of the covariate for which the relationship between the covariate and outcome are comparable in the two groups. In this example it identifies five values of Puppy_love (two, three, five, six, and eight) for which the relationship between love of puppies and happiness is comparable. At each of these design points, we're told the number of cases for the two groups (n one and n two) that have a value of the covariate (Puppy_love) close to these design points (not exactly x, but close to it). Based on these two samples, trimmed means (twenty percent by default) are computed and the difference between them tested. This difference is stored in the column Diff along with the boundaries of the associated ninety-five percent bootstrap confidence interval (corrected to control for doing five tests) in the next two columns. The test statistic comparing the difference is in the column statistic, with its p-value in the final column. Output shows no significant differences between trimmed means for any of the design points (all p-values are greater than zero point zero five).\nd8zj | Thirteen point nine Bayesian analysis with covariates\nywxn | Because the model we have fitted is a linear model with a categorical predictor and a continuous predictor, you can use what you learned to run a Bayesian regression. You would need to manually create dummy variables (as in the file Puppy Love Dummy) and drag these to the box labelled Factor(s) and drag Puppy_Love to the box labelled Covariate(s). You would interpret in the same way as the model we fitted.\nuxhs | Thirteen point ten Calculating the effect size\ned6e | In the previous chapter we used eta squared as an effect size measure when comparing means. When we include a covariate too we have more than one effect and we could calculate eta squared for each effect. We can also use an effect size measure called partial eta squared. This differs from eta squared in that it looks not at the proportion of total variance that a variable explains, but at the proportion of variance that a variable explains that is not explained by other variables in the analysis. Let's look at this with our example. Suppose we want to know the effect size of the dose of puppy therapy. Partial eta squared is the proportion of variance in happiness that the dose of puppy therapy shares that is not attributed to love of puppies (the covariate). If you think about the variance that the covariate cannot explain, there are two sources: it cannot explain the variance attributable to the dose of puppy therapy, sum of squares puppy therapy, and it cannot explain the error variability, sum of squares residual. Therefore, we use these two sources of variance instead of the total variability, sum of squares total, in the calculation. The difference between eta squared and partial eta squared is illustrated by comparing the following two equations:\n6qqm | Two sum of squares Effect\nonum | eta squared equals sum of squares Total\n3iir | (Equation thirteen point six)\n7a0a | Partial eta squared equals sum of squares Effect plus sum of squares Residual sum of squares Effect\no1qp | (Equation thirteen point seven)\njrik | SPSS Statistics will produce partial eta squared for us, but to illustrate its calculation look at equation thirteen point eight, where we use the sums of squares in Output for the effect of dose (twenty-five point one nine), the covariate (fifteen point zero eight) and the error (seventy-nine point zero five):\nsdks | Partial eta dose equals sum of squares dose plus sum of squares residual sum of squares dose equals twenty-five point one nine over twenty-five point one nine plus seventy-nine point zero five equals twenty-five point one nine over one hundred four point two four equals zero point two four\ny8fb | (Equation thirteen point eight)\n521q | Partial eta Puppy_love equals sum of squares Puppy_love plus sum of squares residual sum of squares Puppy_love equals fifteen point zero eight over fifteen point zero eight plus seventy-nine point zero five equals fifteen point zero eight over ninety-four point one three equals zero point one six\nyogo | You can also use omega squared. However, this measure can be calculated only when we have equal numbers of participants in each group (which is not the case in this example). So, we're a bit stumped! Not all is lost, though, because, as I've said many times already, the overall effect size is not nearly as interesting as the effect size for more focused comparisons. These are easy to calculate because we selected to see the model parameters and so we have t-statistics for the covariate and comparisons between the fifteen-and thirty-minute groups and the control and thirty-minute group. These t-statistics have twenty-six degrees of freedom. We can use the same equation as in Section ten point nine point five.\n```",
