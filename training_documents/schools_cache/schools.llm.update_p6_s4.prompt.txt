You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

hd35 | This literature not only synthesized current school leadership practices, but also pointed out the direction of future inquiry and capacity development for leader- ship culturally diversity, responsiveness, and social justice. And while we appreciate extant attempts to define culture as part of the context for empirical study, we see the need to extend and enhance this work theoretically and empirically in light of the contemporary situation of increasing cultural diversity among students. For this, we draw primarily on the work of Pierre Bourdieu (1977a) as well as Lingard and Christie (2003), two scholars who have applied Bourdieu's theories to educational leadership.
2zpk | 4.1 Leadership Approaches from Social Theories
epu7 | Beyond ISLDN, a growing number of educational leadership scholars have proposed leadership approaches in schools aimed at societal transformation, most often using various critical theory lenses that expand functionalist organizational theory and the role of leadership (Theoharis 2007; Shields 2010). Here scholars seek to explain and promote individual school leaders and social justice work in schools. Drawing on empirical findings and other scholarly models or approaches (Burns 1978; Freire 1970; Foster 1986; Leithwood 2010), Shields (2010) highlighted the differences among the three approaches that have dominated the educational leadership field for three decades, transactional, transformational, and transformative leadership. According to Shields (2010), transactional leadership involves a reciprocal trans- action; transformational leadership focuses on improving organizational qualities, dimensions, and effectiveness; and transformative leadership begins by challenging inappropriate uses of power and privilege by challenging inappropriate uses of power and privilege that create or perpetuate inequity and injustice. In Shields' (2010) approach to transformative leadership, the fundamental task is to ask questions, for example, about the purposes of schooling, about which ideas should be taught

0bqy | and about who is successful. Her critique lays the groundwork for the promise of schooling that is more inclusive, democratic, and equitable for more students.
b780 | Transformative leadership, therefore, recognizes the need to begin with critical reflection and analysis and to move through enlightened understanding to action-action to redress wrongs and to ensure that all members of the organization are provided with as level a playing field as possible-not only with respect to access but also with regard to academic, social and civic outcomes. (Shields 2010, p. 572).
ccmb | Shields (2010) argues for a careful and consistent deconstruction of old knowledge frameworks that perpetuated deficit thinking and inequity, creating new frameworks of inclusion and equity that undergirded the continuous improvement mentality. Although, Shields (2010) enhances leadership approaches to include aims toward social transformation, we still do not see the educational leadership literature as complete in terms of understanding leadership practice in a cultural context.
ma93 | Other scholars have proposed transformative leadership approaches (e.g. Dantley and Tillman 2006; Fuhrman and Gruenewald 2004;) to shed light on how the school social and cultural context influences the operation of effectiveness in elemen- tary schools. In our view, the significance of their findings is limited in terms of explicit explanations of students' social and cultural capital in instructional improve- ment programs and leadership as it emerged from the effective schools' literature. Besides focus on the development of curriculum, the following studies indicate the characteristics of transformative leaders.
c6hh | Transformative principals develop a clear school mission, monitor student progress, protect instructional time from interruptions, and maintain high standards for teachers and students (Bossert et al. 1981; Brookover and Lezotte 1979; Murphy et.al. 1985; Stallings and Mohlman 1981; Wellisch et al. 1978). Dimmock and Walker (2004) aligned school leadership with reflection of strategic intents, values, and connectivity, emphasizing the importance social-cultural context in contempo- rary multiethnic communities. Research (e.g. Hallinger 2016) regarding knowledge- based educational leadership and management drew on the way school context (community, socio-cultural, political, and economic) influences leadership practice, thus illustrating the nature of successful leadership practice. Khalifa et al., (2016) also discusses culturally responsive school leadership and argues that culture plays a significant role in shaping the thinking, behaviors, and practices of school leaders and other school stakeholders. Theoharis (2007) concept of social justice leadership illustrates how principals develop and sustain their social justice work in order to lead their schools to transform and to benefit the marginalized students. Hallinger's (2017) systematic review of research on educational leadership and management in Africa shows the increasing need to diversify the corpus of studies beyond the traditional Anglo-American centers of knowledge production. We see Bourdieu's theories and thinking tools as a way to diversify the corpus of studies beyond the Anglo-American centers of knowledge production as we shall discuss below.
y7ea | 5 Bourdieu's 'Thinking Tools'
nav4 | Many education researchers know Pierre Bourdieu for his work on social and cultural reproduction. For example, Bourdieu (1990a, 2008, 1974, 1977a, 1986) describes how schools are not agents of social mobility but rather perpetuate existing societal inequalities. According to Bourdieu, the concepts of habitus, capital, and field are integral in understanding practice. Bourdieu (1977a, 1984, 1990a) explained that practice was the complex interplay of these main concepts. These concepts help make sense of the relationship between objective social structures (like institutions) and everyday practice.
gem8 | 6 Habitus
e8nr | Bourdieu describes habitus as "socialized subjectivity" (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992, p. 126). Bourdieu suggests that through the experiences of everyday life social agents (individuals and collective) unconsciously adopt the norms of the society. In society, social practices are characterized by regularities despite there being no explicit rules that dictate these practices (Bourdieu 1990b). Conceptions of what is right and/or appropriate become embedded, instinctive patterns of thought and behavior. According to Bourdieu (1990a), habitus constitutes,
k78w | Systems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them. (p. 53).
g9du | To Bourdieu, habitus constrains but does not determine thought and action; it operates at the subconscious level. Bourdieu (1984) writes, "The schemes of the habitus, the primary forms of classification, owe their specific efficacy to the fact that they function below the level of consciousness and language, beyond the reach of introspective scrutiny or control by the will" (p. 466). For Bourdieu, habitus defines the dispositions through which we perceive and act in the world through lasting exposure to particular social conditions and conditionings. The habitus is not just the producer of actions, but it is a product of the structural conditions a social agent encounters. Bourdieu (1990b) also describes habitus as a "feel for the game" or a "second sense" that equips social agents with practical knowledge to navigate the social field.
f682 | The concept of habitus confronted organizational theorists' assumptions that indi- viduals and organizations make rational decisions. According to Bourdieu the theo- rists ignored the socio-economic conditions that shaped the actions they take (Bour- dieu 1990b; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992). Bourdieu concludes that habitus is the result of social conditionings or history but it can be transformed as it encounters different types of fields (Bourdieu 1990a, 1990b; Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992).
