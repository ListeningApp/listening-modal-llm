We see that the model is in excellent agreement with the observational SNe Ia data.\nsyiw | Six Constraints from Primordial Nucleosynthesis\nkg3t | Before we find constraints on power-law cosmology parameters from primordial big bang nucleosynthesis, it is helpful to reproduce the brief review of the BBN in standard model given by Kaplinghat et al. The neutron-proton ratio n over p equals exp of negative Q over T, where Q equals one point two nine mega electron volts is the neutron-proton mass difference, at high temperatures T greater than or equal to one mega electron volt is maintained by charged-current weak interactions among neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos. When the Universe is of order one second old, T less than or equal to one mega electron volt, the n over p ratio \"freezes out\" due to the inequilibrium of weak interactions and free neutron decay with a lifetime of eight hundred eighty-seven seconds. At this stage the deuterium, D, produced due to\nlvae | Constraints on power-law cosmology\no9sc | collision of neutrons and protons is rapidly photodissociated by the cosmic background photons. This causes very low abundance of D and thus heavier nuclei are not formed at this epoch. Thus nucleosynthesis is delayed by this \"photodissociation bottleneck\". However, when the universe is approximately three minutes old, the temperature falls below approximately eighty kilo electron volts, the deuterium bottleneck is broken. At this stage the nuclear reactions quickly burn out the remaining free neutrons into helium four and leave trace amounts of D, helium three and lithium seven. A viable cosmological model must mimic the above scenario for proper synthesis of the light elements in the early Universe. In the following, we test the power-law cosmological model for primordial nucleosynthesis.\n121u | In power-law cosmology the scale factor a of t and the cosmic microwave background temperature T of t are related through the relation:\nzh03 | a over a naught equals T naught over beta T equals open parenthesis t over t naught close parenthesis to the power of one over one plus q, (fourteen)\n1mvw | where beta stands for any non-adiabatic expansion due to entropy production. In standard cosmology, the instantaneous e plus e minus annihilation is assumed at T equals m subscript e. The heating due to this annihilation is accounted by beta where beta equals one for T less than m subscript e while beta equals open parenthesis one one over four close parenthesis to the power of one third for\n6d4s | T greater than m subscript e. In order to find constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis on power-law cosmology parameters, we utilize t naught approximately thirteen point seven giga years (age of the Universe) estimated by Komatsu et al. on the basis of seven year data from WMAP and astrophysical data from other sources. Further, the model is assumed to have current temperature T naught equals two point seven two eight Kelvin. The primordial nucleosynthesis requires that t less than or equal to eight hundred eighty-seven T approximately eighty kilo electron volts. This puts the following constraints on q and",
