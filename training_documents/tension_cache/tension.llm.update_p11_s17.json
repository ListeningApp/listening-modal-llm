Overall, the respondents seem skeptical to the information availability in such reports and express a high appetite for reporting in accordance with recognized standards.\nu8nw | M equals four point seven seven S D equals one point five five. Finally, with regard to information quality, the respondents gave a mixed assessment. When asked to consider different information quality characteristics of sustainability\nl2v9 | Sustainability reporting and materiality\nafbe | reports, they assessed them favorably with regard to the relevance of information M equals four point eight zero S D equals one point three five, moderately with regard to comparability of information M equals three point seven seven S D equals one point three six and poorly with regard to the timeliness M equals three point two zero S D equals one point four five and verifiability M equals three point zero zero S D equals one point zero eight of information.\n78r8 | In the qualitative interviews, the respondents were given the opportunity to elaborate more in-depth on the same topics, based on the questions in the interview guide in Table two. We treat the three topics information needs, information availability and information quality in three sub-sections, with respondents' views on materiality integrated therein.\n320g | Information needs\ntp8g | The respondents differed substantially in accordance with their roles and the purposes of reading sustainability reports in those contexts. The portfolio manager differed from most of the others by desiring information about how sustainability improvements could lead to new business opportunities: \"We are as interested in information about such opportunities as we are about risks and damages,\" he pointed out. The compliance officer took an opposite stance, in stating that \"I am not looking for profitability - I am looking for traces of real sustainability.\"\ngxfd | The financial analyst took a different view and stated: \"Our perspective is somewhat more short-term - we are largely looking at the next quarter.\" Importantly, however, he also emphasized that this implied a stronger emphasis on dynamic materiality - information that was often not readily available in sustainability reports. Still, he pointed out that \"The reporting needs to be as consistent as possible over time in order to allow for comparison - even on issues that change in importance and materiality over time.\" The portfolio manager also pointed out the trade-off between the desire for as much relevant information as possible on the one hand and quantified and verifiable information on the other hand: \"The reports should be based on good and preferably quantified, variables. But preferably less words and pictures and information that cannot be verified - that only drowns out the material information.\"\ns2v1 | The sustainability manager who worked for a large bank had the view that the information that was developed in a way that catered to investor needs was also the most interesting for other stakeholder groups. He said: \"Sustainability reports should be tailored for investors - that will make them more useful for other stakeholders as well. The target audience for such reports is often unclear and developing them in a way that is more concentrated around pure facts and figures will most likely make them useful for the largest number of stakeholders.\" The public funding manager somewhat echoed this by stating that\njkp9 | Sustainability reporting and materiality Mean S D\nz8tt | I believe that there is large overlap between sustainability issues that are financially\n9g22 | material and sustainability issues that are important for other stakeholders such as\n41fx | NGOs and society at large\n7um8 | I believe that there is considerable change over time in which sustainability issues\nuow2 | I believe that sustainability reporting should account only for sustainability issues\niat7 | that are financially material\nywwr | \"The information needs of users are converging - they are becoming more and more similar and that is a good thing. When the banks and the government agencies start adopting the same perspectives and the same language that helps in making better and more consistent decisions.\"\n0i6j | Information availability\n87cq | The respondents largely echoed the same viewpoints that were captured in the survey questions about information availability. In particular, they found it difficult to distinguish between sustainability performance information that was financially material and information that was more broadly important for other stakeholder groups or for making inferences about real sustainability impacts. The financial officer argued that \"there seems to be good intentions in the reporting, but it is hard to discern information that can be verified and that allows for comparisons - over time and between companies.\" The portfolio manager emphasized how the reports alone were usually not sufficient to provide the full information required for his purposes: \"Many of the things we are looking for do not necessarily appear in the reports - for instance information about emerging topics. If the information is contested or appears risky to disclose, we often need to be in dialogue with the companies to get hold of the information we need.\"\n0qs3 | The compliance officer emphasized that the information tended to \"flow together and become muddled\" and that information that should have been readily available was often presented \"in unexpected form in unexpected places\" in the reports. She also lamented that there seemed to be differences between companies' reporting that could be a consequence of differences in their information provision: \"The companies are very different in what sustainability efforts they choose to carry out and they similarly seem to report differently in a manner that reflects those activities, their priorities and which issues they can provide information about.\"\nz8f7 | Finally, several of the respondents pointed out that they believed that sustainability reports were becoming increasingly overflowed with information. The sustainability manager argued that there was too much \"prose\" and \"wordiness\" on issues of varying materiality, while there was often lacking information about issues one would consider financially material. The financial analyst argued that there was a large variation in how available and clearly communicated the different information was. He believed that there was still a lack of high-quality quantitative information but pointed out that \"financial analysts always want more numbers.\"\n7w7j | Information quality\n51vd | The financial officer pointed out that the narrative style dominated sustainability reports and made a distinction between goals, efforts and results: \"Different users might differ in their interests of whether they want to know more about the efforts in themselves or simply about results. The information quality is often better and more concrete for the latter, but many users really want to know about what the company has actually done and how its efforts actually produced the results they report.\" The public funding manager argued that environmental performance information was generally of higher quality than social performance information. She moreover added: \"There is concrete information - tons of CO2, OK. Percentage of women on the board, OK. But the overall picture, actually getting a grasp of the ESG characteristics of the company - then, the report itself comes short.\"\nbaj1 | The financial analyst pointed at comparability as a key problem, which echoes the results from the survey. He added: \"Take oil companies as an example: They seem to arbitrarily select years as point of comparison in order to make improvements appear larger.\nn1wo | Sustainability reporting and materiality\n```",
