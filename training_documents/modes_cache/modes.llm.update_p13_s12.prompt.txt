You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

31e1 | Strengths of the Collaborating Mode
40ry | The collaborating mode reflects many of the core val- ues of occupational therapy. Specifically, the field places a strong emphasis on promoting client choice, freedom, and autonomy. Therapists who utilize the collaborating mode demonstrate these values by enabling clients to
d1j2 | CASE EXAMPLE 4.3 The Collaborating Mode
wstc | I met Edward, a 17-year-old boy, when he was admitted to the adolescent psychiatric unit for aggression toward staff and peers at his residential placement. At this time his primary diagnoses were conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and posttrau- matic stress disorder. Treatment was initiated with administration of the Adolescent Occupational Self-Assessment, an interview developed for this setting based on the Model of Human Occupation.
ba1e | During his initial interview, Edward was coop- erative but made no eye contact and gave vague answers to the questions asked about his daily routine. He lacked insight into his aggressive be- haviors and took no personal responsibility for his actions. He perceived himself as being alone in the world and was anxious to move to independent living where he could come and go as he pleased. Edward had low self-esteem and a poorly defined sense of self. He was motivated to be successful in the role of worker, friend, boyfriend, family member, and student yet consistently experienced failure in all these roles. Edward also reported on the initial assessment interview that he was having some difficulty managing his affect and regulating his feelings.
en95 | Edward had a strong interest in origami and experienced a sense of success and pleasure when engaged in this activity. It was the only activity that he wanted to do while on the unit. Because he would not engage in much of anything else, including interacting with his peers during group therapy, I decided not to try to coax him into doing things he disliked. I did not want to become locked in a power dilemma with him by insisting that he engage in therapy tasks or activities with his peers. Instead, I asked him if he would be interested in teaching his peers how to make some simple origami shapes. I asked him to think about it and made it clear that this was not a required
l3do | assignment but felt that others might find this ac- tivity interesting. The next day I approached him in his room, and he stated that he wanted to teach this to others. I explained that we could co-lead an Interest Exploration group that meets every other Wednesday. I asked him what materials he needed, how much time he needed, and any other supports required. I wanted to empower him and encourage him to take a strong leadership role. We talked about how much time he needed to prepare and scheduled a time for us to meet and plan the group structure.
u9bo | When the day came for group he was nervous about being in front of his peers, so we had a prac- tice session where he role-played with me about what might occur in his role as a leader. We talked about listening when peers had a question and to be patient if some people had difficulty. I helped him empathize with his peers who might not have done this before and needed more support. I also explained to him that I was there to support him and that I was learning as well. If he needed any help, he could just ask. He agreed that I could help let him know when to slow down his teaching or if people were having difficulty hearing his directions (he had a soft voice and sometimes mumbled his words).
7avo | During the group meeting, I watched as his face broke into a shy smile when peers would thank him for sharing his skills and told him how much fun they had. Edward, if only for a brief time, had experienced how it felt to be appreciated, respected, and even admired for his abilities. As we processed the group afterward, he shared that he had felt ner- vous at first but then became more comfortable and asked if we could co-lead another group. I felt that our therapeutic rapport had reached a new level in terms of Edward's willingness to trust me and to allow me to challenge him around developing a more defined sense of self.
uzo6 | choose activities, have opinions, and participate actively in evaluating the process of therapy and reflecting on their own performance. Use of the collaborating mode is likely to instill confidence in clients because it conveys the idea that the therapist views them as competent in their ability to direct their treatment, choose occupations, and gain greater control in determining the course of their own lives (Fig. 4.5).
89b4 | Cautions of the Collaborating Mode
5f7e | The cautions associated with a collaborative style are subtle and involve overreliance on this style or using it nonjudiciously across all types of therapy clients. The collaborating mode may not be received well by clients accustomed to viewing, and who prefer to view, service providers as authority figures or experts. Clients inclined to participate in social or cultural networks with hierar- chical role structures and a lack of available and trans- parent information about health care may not understand the therapy process well enough to know what is best for themselves or may not value independence as the ultimate goal of therapy. Such clients may be looking for structured instruction, advice, resources, and ongoing direction.
h83u | Therapists who overvalue the collaborating mode may misunderstand or misperceive less-engaged clients as being passive or even apathetic about their therapy, when these clients are merely behaving according to their own health literacy levels or within their own sociocul- tural norms. This misperception is likely to be associated with a lack of understanding of the client's narrative, a breakdown in trust, and a lower quality of communication between the client and the therapist. If the therapist does not identify and examine this discrepancy in preferred working styles at a conscious level, she or he may become disappointed in the client or emotionally disengaged.
kjoa | In some cases, unrestrained or unstructured collabora- tion may result in diffusion of responsibility or uncertainty regarding who is responsible for which part of the therapy process. Occasionally, it causes confusion about roles in the therapeutic relationship. In addition to these cautions, therapists who overutilize the collaborating mode run the risk of overestimating their client's strengths and capac- ities, thereby minimizing the client's need for direction. There are times when clients need more directive therapy to feel a sense of psychological security and emotional stability. Asking clients to participate collaboratively be- fore they are ready, or without grading the collaboration, sometimes causes clients to feel confused, lost, insecure, or anxious about the therapy process.
wb1c | Empathizing Mode
ak13 | As noted in Chapter 1, there is a strong emphasis on empathy in contemporary discussions of occupational therapy. Use of the empathizing mode involves the actual enactment of empathetic communication toward the client during therapy. This enactment includes bear- ing witness to and fully understanding a client's physical, psychological, interpersonal, and emotional experience. This is accomplished through seeking to understand the client by:
s7el | Expressing a general curiosity about the client's state of mind or experience through general questions (e.g., What is on your mind right now? Is there some- thing you do not like about this activity? How are you feeling? Where would you like to begin?). This process is referred to as gentle inquiry.
0lfu | Cautiously asking deepening questions that allow the client to elaborate upon a current or past event
cnjl | (e.g., Can you tell me more about that? When did it happen? What were you thinking at that time? Who was with you?).
rtdl | Validating the client's experience and viewpoint, even if it is maladaptive or negative.
norp | Summarizing one's understanding of the client's expe- rience and asking the client if the summarization accu- rately reflects that experience (i.e., making summary statements).
