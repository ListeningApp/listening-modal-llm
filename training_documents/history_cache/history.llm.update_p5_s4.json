        "content": "p6pq | Still described twenty cases of children with a \"defect of moral control as a morbid manifestation, without general impairment of intellect and without physical disease.\" Interestingly, Still observed fifteen cases of boys and five cases of girls. This is \"a disproportion which [in Still's opinion] is not altogether accidental\" and which is consistent with the commonly observed uneven male to female sex ratio of three to one in child and adolescent ADHD. Most children for whom the first manifestation of the defect was determined showed symptoms before the age of seven (seven out of nine cases), which currently is a diagnostic criterion of DSM-IV-TR. Still furthermore recognized that a morbid manifestation of a child's moral control can be considered only when the child does not meet the standard for moral conduct at a certain age within a \"range of variation which we arbitrarily recognize as normal.\" The American Psychiatric Association also states that for a diagnosis of ADHD, symptoms have to be present \"to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level.\" Still argued that a \"lack of moral control may be shown in many ways.\" The symptoms listed are:\nzse6 | (One) passionateness; (Two) spitefulness - cruelty; (Three) jealousy; (Four) lawlessness; (Five) dishonesty; (Six) wanton mischievousness - destructiveness; (Seven) shamelessness - immodesty; (Eight) sexual immorality; and (Nine) viciousness. The keynote of these qualities is self-gratification, the immediate gratification of self without regard either to the good of others or to the larger and more remote good of self.\np2n3 | Although most of these symptoms are not directly associated with the current concept of ADHD, the keynote identified by Still fits an important finding of modern ADHD research. Delay of gratification appears to be \"a major problem for children with ADHD\" and reactions without regard to consequences, whether \"to the good of others or [the] good of self,\" are strongly associated with impulsivity, a main symptom of ADHD. The most common symptom observed\nohh7 | by Still in these cases was \"an abnormal degree of passionateness.\" Passionateness did not mean affection, but some \"impulsivity regarding some immediate goal\" and a kind of \"quickness to display all emotion and especially those of frustration, anger, hostility, and aggression,\" for example expressed \"in outbursts of rage.\" Similarly \"jealousy\" does, according to Still, not mean \"the mere emotion but its uncontrolled expression.\" Still attributes these symptoms to \"a morbid failure to control emotional activities,\" which is due to an \"exaggeration of excitability.\" These descriptions are similar to the current concept of impulsivity. Although not explicitly mentioned in DSM-IV-TR, impulsivity as a main symptom of ADHD is often associated with a lack of emotional impulse control, a low frustration tolerance and some abrupt outbursts of rage. Still describes some cases with signs of impulsivity,\nvbni | for instance, the case of the boy, aged eleven and a half years: his mother stated that in the midst of playing quietly with other children he would suddenly seize two of them and bang their heads together, making them cry with pain and he seems unable to resist it.\ndgcw | Still also mentions that many of his depicted cases showed \"a quite abnormal incapacity for sustained attention. Both parents and school teachers have specially noted this feature in some of my cases as something unusual.\" An attention deficit is a main symptom of ADHD and, according to the current DSM-IV-TR criteria, a child with ADHD \"has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities.\" Difficulties at school are frequently observed in children with ADHD. In particular, the notion of children with a significant attention deficit, but \"without general impairment of intellect\" fits modern-day ADHD. Recent studies have shown that the IQ of children with ADHD is within the normal range. Some of the cases cited by Still showed remarkable symptoms of inattention, for example,\ngvwz | the case of a boy with moral defect who would repeat the process of saying 'Good-night' several times before he was aware that he had done so; the same boy would often put his boot on the wrong foot apparently without noticing it. Another boy, aged six years, with marked moral defect was unable to keep his attention even to a game for more than a very short time, and, as might be expected, the failure of\nsk5m | attention was very noticeable at school, with the result that in some cases the child was backward in school attainments, although in manner and ordinary conversation he appeared as bright and intelligent as any child could be.\nqws8 | Many of Still's descriptions appear to indicate that children in the early twentieth century showed clear symptoms of ADHD. However, most of the symptoms listed by Still and described in his cases do not refer to ADHD. Still also reported children who \"seemed to take a delight in tormenting the other children,\" for example by throwing other children's toys in the fire and laughing at their grief. He furthermore described children who pathologically stole or lied with extraordinary insensitivity to any punishment, children who were aggressive and attacked strange children or threatened to hurt their mothers, \"lawless\" children with \"a reckless disregard for command and authority,\" children with \"a complete lack of natural affection\" even to their parents, and children who showed cruelty to animals for example by attempting to put a cat in the fire or by \"cutting a rabbit alive smothered in blood.\"",
