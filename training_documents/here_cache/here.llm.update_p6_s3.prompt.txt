You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

gem8 | Of course, the label "European imperialism" does not in any sense rep- resent a systematic movement, a sustained campaign, or a coherent body of thought. Nowhere is this more clear than with the British Empire. Although by the turn of this century the empire encompassed more than one-quarter of the world's people, the British liked to think that it had been acquired over a five-century period in a "fit of absence of mind," as the British historian John Seeley put it in the last century (1884, p. 10). The empire was made up of a makeshift assortment of Crown colonies, white dominions, mandates, naval bases, trading ports, and the unique Indian raj. To name what was common to all of these arrangements is difficult, and so the term imperialism will have to operate as a loosely conceived historical phenomenon that covers a myriad of ventures directed at extending the dominion of Europe around the globe.8
e8nr | At the risk, then, of lending too much coherence to the forces of Euro- pean imperialism and of seeming to belittle the violence and injustice that ac- companied the exploits of these "gentlemanly capitalists," as they have been characterized, this book focuses on the activities that were conducted in the name of imperialism's intellectual interests, which I take to be its educational project.9 Beginning in earnest during the eighteenth century, the research and development arm of imperialism was gradually staffed by increasingly pro- fessional cadres of geologists, naturalists, astronomers, ethnographers, phi- losophers, historians, geographers, painters, and poets (many of them holding day jobs as sailors, soldiers, missionaries, and bureaucrats). The whole thing resulted in a Victorian "obsession with gathering and ordering information," as Thomas Richards describes it, that was closely connected to the "adminis- trative core" of the British Empire through such educational institutions as the British Museum, the Royal Society, the Royal Geographic Society, the Royal Botanical Gardens, and the India Survey, as well as the universities (1993, p. 9). It produced an imaginary "imperial archive," in Richards's
k78w | terms, which amounted to "a fantasy of knowledge collected in the service of state and empire" that was thought capable of turning the world into a com- prehensive order (p. 6). It was the duty and pleasure of these learned men and women, as this book will detail, to make the whole of the world coherent for the West by bringing all we knew of it within the imperial order of things. So it was that this order dictated all that future generations were going to learn of the world.
g9du | Today, that order may seem to be a thing of the past. The great colonial empires collapsed after the Second World War, undone by the politics of self- determination, the cold war, and transnational capitalism. A hundred nations were born, legalized segregation was declared unconstitutional in America, apartheid was finally ended in South Africa, and the Soviet Union was broken up. Transnational capital remains a global force, an imperialism of a differ- ent order, that extends beyond the scope of this book, which is taken up with the particular manifestations of the colonial legacy.10 Yet the West is still deal- ing directly with the colonial legacy on a number of fronts. Consider Aus- tralia, where Aborigines' land claims met with considerable resistance until, only recently, the courts corrected one of colonialism's great myths by con- ceding that the British had not found a terra nullius, that is, an unoccupied land, when they first arrived (Milliken, 1993). In Canada, the Quebecois and First Nations peoples are each still working on forming postcolonial associa- tions within or apart from the dominion (and are often at odds with each other in this struggle). The First Nations peoples in Canada do not hesitate to speak of a "colonialism on trial" in addressing unsettled land claims now be- fore the courts (Monet and Skanu'U, 1992).
f682 | In America, the legacy persists in a deepening of the "color line," with increasing segregation in schools and discrimination in health care ("Race," 1993; "Segregation's Threat," 1993). Bob Herbert (1995) writes in the New York Times of "a besieged black population" facing restricted voting rights, dimin-

pbea | ished affirmative action, education, and job training opportunities, and cur- tailed support for the poor (largely the black poor) in housing, health, and food. For Herbert, the "increasingly harrowing times" that face the African American people bear "the foul legacy of 200 years of slavery and nearly a century and half of violent and grotesque racism." Meanwhile, a rising na- tivism uses the specter of an "immigration crisis" to advocate restrictive leg- islation for newcomers and a pitting of one minority group against another (Rayner, 1996; F. R. Lee, 1993). "The Asian invasion" (and its variations) whether in the New Yorker or in Sports Illustrated, is just one of the racial clichés that have returned to prominence (W. Wong, 1994). Immigration also preoccupies Europe, with its internal colonization of guest workers facing a rising xenophobia that sustains, for example, the demand for blood citizen- ship in Germany and talk of a fortress Europe, which, having made so much of the world, now closes its door to it.11
ccpt | Beyond the economic and political legacy of the colonial era, the West has also been busy producing a colonial nostalgic that speaks to the lost style and seeming grace of those heady days. The African Queen, A Passage to India, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Indochine are but a few films serving up a fascina- tion with the exotic, with Walt Disney making it a speciality. Disney's Aladdin perpetuates the charmingly despotic Eastern other in a cartoonish oriental- ism, and The Jungle Book and Pocahontas extend the characterizations of this colorful period (Karim, 1993). Red Rose tea announces that its company's agents "comb the backwaters of Ceylon (sic), India, and Africa in search of the most treasured tea leaves" for "tea that means the world to you." Colo- nial imagery wafts through the perfume ads for Ralph Lauren's "Safari," and the New York Times spread on "Indo-Chic," with fashions by Chanel and Ar- mani, was shot in Vietnam, one "of the rare places where one can still expe- rience true glamour. . . . There's something otherworldly about the place" (O'Neill, 1993). For the home, colonial nostal-chic can be had from Domain Home Fashions: "No one went farther to make themselves comfortable than the British," its ad explains. "From the West Indies to East India, their tradi- tional furnishings were enriched by the tropical cultures of the colonies, and now you can reclaim this adventurous and romantic era for yourself. . . . After all, it's your empire."
