You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

uodj | Our use of the term "global" here should not be miscon- strued as necessarily implying a planetary reach. For each issue under study, a separate determination must be made as to how far exactly large-scale processes and structures extend. In much existing work, historians have prematurely confined their in- quiries to fixed containers and geographical constraints. It would be equally fallacious to go to the opposite extreme and presuppose globality in every instance. What "global" suggests, therefore, is an openness to pursuing links and the question of causality beyond conventional containers and spatial units; it denotes "simply the methodological concern with experi- menting beyond familiar geographical boundaries."14
k16v | If "comparisons and connections" serves as the conven- tional shorthand for global history, then we must add a third "c": causality, pursued up to a global scale. The decision to focus on large forms of structured transformation and inte- gration is a choice that sets global history apart from other ap- proaches, such as comparative and transnational history. The emphasis on global integration will almost certainly raise a host of questions. Does this choice make it impossible to write global history about eras before integration, and before mo- dernity? Will this choice narrow the range of possible topics by insisting on an identifiably global causality? Does it com- pel global historians to study this global level explicitly? I will take up these issues in the following chapter.
b2lm | Beyond connectivity: competing narratives
ti7f | In order to better understand the significance of a non- internalist approach, and of the analytical role of global inte- gration, it may be helpful to briefly compare the perspective
oksu | of global history with three influential but contrasting ways in which historians have hitherto understood and interpreted transformations on a planetary scale. Somewhat schemati- cally, we can label them as Western exceptionalism, cultural imperialism, and the paradigm of independent origins. I will briefly sketch these three narratives and point out their short- comings when compared to a global history approach.
wtow | The first metanarrative, still firmly entrenched in many text- books and general overview works, assumes a general process of modernization that originated in Europe and was then gradually disseminated around the globe. The defining fea- tures of this notion of modernity are familiar: the functional differentiation of social spheres, such as the economy, poli- tics, the social, and culture; and a gradual rationalization of all these spheres, giving birth to a capitalist and industrialized economy, the nation-state, and meritocratic bureaucracies; the replacement of hereditary estates by a class society and the modern individual; and the overcoming of traditional and re- ligious cosmologies through what Max Weber called the "dis- enchantment of the world."
o22k | In principle, these were seen as universal developments, but in actual practice they emerged in Europe first and were then conveyed to the rest of the world. Such a diffusionist reading-epitomized by William McNeill's The Rise of the West-lay at the heart of many older world histories, espe- cially when guided by modernization theory, but also in many of the Marxist variants of world histories. "For the last thou- sand years," as David Landes has summarized this narrative, "Europe (the West) has been the prime mover of development and modernity."15 Such triumphalist formulations have be- come much less common, so that most accounts now replace the unabashed Eurocentrism of earlier days with a recognition
nwfz | of the various forms of negotiation and adaptation that at- tended the process. At its core, however, the basic assumptions of this narrative are still in place: Europe/the West is seen as the locus of innovation, and world history is essentially un- derstood as a history of the diffusion of European progress.16
nvfy | Against this formerly dominant view, a second interpreta- tion emerged that was based on a radically critical reading of the dissemination of Western modernity. This view is associ- ated with postcolonial, subaltern, and some Marxist perspec- tives. In it, modernity remains essentially European and is still equated with the march of universal reason. But the spread of modernity is seen not as emancipatory but as a process of deprivation.
mror | There are two different, but related arguments involved. The first is the hypothesis that it was Enlightenment univer- salism that lay at the root of the West's expansionist urge. It was only a small step, the critique runs, from positing univer- sal standards to deciding to intervene and to implement these standards, by force, under the auspices of a paternalistic civi- lizing mission. The second argument is related. The spread of Western modernity is understood as a form of cultural impe- rialism with the potential to eradicate alternative worldviews. Critical scholars have interpreted the spread of Enlighten- ment tenets in the nineteenth century as a process of coerced and often brutal diffusion, made possible and driven by highly asymmetrical relations of power.17
zlxc | Both approaches discussed so far-emancipatory modern- ization and cultural imperialism-are essentially diffusion- ist and take the European origins of modernity for granted. What is more, they rest on the supposed absence of substan- tial cultural and social development elsewhere as one of their
k0bw | axiomatic tenets. In recent years, however, the European claim to originality, to exclusive authorship of modernity, has been called into question. Historians have begun to look for paral- lels and analogies to the European "march of civilization," for autochthonous processes of rationalization that did not de- pend on, but led to similar results as, developments in Europe. This is the third paradigm sketched here, and it forms part of a larger scholarly debate on the origins of modernity. It was born out of a desire to challenge diffusionist notions of mod- ernization, and to acknowledge the social dynamics that pre- vailed in many societies before their encounter with the West. The aim was to replace older notions of traditional societies and "people without history" with a broader understanding of multiple modernities. But in the end, this approach posits an identical telos-a modern, capitalist society-even if this goal is not achieved via transformations inspired by contact with the West, but rather builds on indigenous cultural resources: a teleology of universal disenchantment, realized in each soci- ety internally, but across the globe.
aq5a | All three approaches converge in their methodological bias for national and civilizational frames. Their many differ- ences notwithstanding, all rely on internalist logics in their attempt to explain what must be understood as a global phe- nomenon. If we are going to take the challenge of global his- tory seriously, we need to move beyond these three approaches and focus on the connectivities and processes of integration that have shaped and reconfigured societies globally. Sanjay Subrahmanyam has argued that modernity is "historically a global and conjunctural phenomenon, not a virus that spreads from one place to another. It is located in a series of histori- cal processes that brought hitherto relatively isolated societies
sc5y | into contact, and we must seek its roots in a set of diverse phe- nomena."18 From such a vantage point, it is less instructive to search for alleged origins-European or otherwise-than to focus on the global conditions and interactions through which the modern world emerged. This is why notions of global in- tegration and system-like dependencies are crucial: changes in one location within the integrated world ripple through the system to affect other parts as well.
