You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

On the wall of the vesicle, a ~150 um round-shaped grain of merril- lite was identified (Fig. S5). Smaller grains <LATEX>\left( \sim 2 0 \mu m \right)</LATEX> of merrillite were also found in its igneous textures. The five merrillite grains with seven spot analyses did not define a 238U_206Pb isochron or 207 Pb-206Pb isochron age with meaningful precision, primarily be- cause of the overlapping of the data. The model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / ^ { 2 0 6 } p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age was calculated at 4563-4515 Ma, with a weighted mean of 4552.0 ± 8.8 Ma (Fig. 4).
colo | 5. Discussion
d6r4 | 5.1. Two ages in Juvinas: older apatite and younger merrillite
9mrz | Only Juvinas presents two distinctly different ages for apatite and merrillite. The model <LATEX>{ } ^ { 2 0 7 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * } / ^ { 2 0 6 } \mathrm { P b } ^ { * }</LATEX> ages are <LATEX>4 5 1 6 . 9 \pm 1 0 . 4</LATEX> Ma for the apatite and <LATEX>4 1 5 0 . 3 \pm 1 1 . 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> for the merrillite (Fig. 4). Most apatite (except for Juv-1 in Fig. 1a) and all merrillite grains are located in a close area, even though they recorded completely different timings. One possible explanation is that the U-Pb sys- tem in merrillite can more readily be reset than that in apatite so that only merrillite records the 4150-Ma event. Although we know the U-Pb closure temperature of apatite (discussed later), unfortunately, there is no available information for merrillite at this moment. Previous SIMS U-Pb studies have not found such age differences between meteoritical apatite and merrillite (Sano et al., 2000; Terada and Sano, 2002). It is likely that the U-Pb systems in apatite and merrillite record the same events in regular cases. Another, more plausible case is that the reheating temperature in the 4,150-Ma event was heterogeneous and that it locally reached higher temperatures. The relationship between the apatite/merril- lite and the adjacent silica polymorphs supports this interpretation. Tridymite is a high-temperature silica phase (stable at 870-1470 ℃ under 1 atm; Fenner, 1913). The tridymite in Juvinas has a smooth surface and euhedral to subhedral shapes (Fig. 1), suggesting that it recrystallized from primary mesostasis (or its partial melt) dur- ing a high temperature reheating (>870℃) and subsequent rapid cooling process. We assume this event to be identical to the mer- rillite <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age, because all of <LATEX>t h e</LATEX> merrillite grains are located close to the tridymite. It is likely that they suffered the local heterogeneous thermal metamorphism at 4150 Ma. Similar metamorphic origins of tridymite have been suggested for several basaltic eucrites (Yamaguchi et al., 1996; Liao et al., 2019). Con- versely, the porous and anhedral quartz may be a relic of igneous mesostasis, consistent with observations of other basaltic eucrites (Fig. 1; Liao et al. (2019) and references therein). Considering that the apatite is located close to the mesostasis quartz, as well as in the lithic clast, the apatite should be an igneous relic mineral.
pk06 | 5.2. Brecciated eucrites are consistent with a continual collisional history
7wn9 | What do the two ages found in Juvinas mean? Both the ap- atite <LATEX>\left( \sim 4 5 2 0 \quad M a \right)</LATEX> and the merrillite (~4150 Ma) in Juvinas are significantly younger than the crystallization age of Juvinas whole rock dated by the Mn-Cr system at <LATEX>4 5 6 2 . 5 \pm 1 . 0 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> (Lugmair and Shukolyukov, 1998). The U-Pb age of the Juvinas zircon recorded a thermal event at 4545 ± 15 Ma (Zhou et al., 2013), consistent with the ubiquitous crustal metamorphism of Vesta at 4554.5 ± 2.0 Ma (Iizuka et al., 2015). The 4520-Ma Juvinas apatite is ex- pected to have recorded either a slow cooling process subsequent
wcd0 | to the 4554-Ma crustal metamorphism similar to the case of the Agoult apatite (discussed in the following subsection), or indepen- dent impact reheating similar to the previous NWA 6594 apatite (Pb-Pb age of 4523 ± 2 Ma; Liao et al., 2019). Conversely, the 4150-Ma merrillite accompanied by tridymite may represent the timing of an intense impact reheating event. The U-Pb systems in the Juvinas pyroxene and plagioclase were also severely disturbed (Galer and Lugmair, 1996). Their 207 Pb-206Pb mineral isochron age was reported at 4320.9 ± 1.7 Ma (Galer and Lugmair, 1996), which may be the result of an incomplete U-Pb reset at a later reheat- ing event (i.e., the 4150-Ma event). The K-Ar system was further disturbed (the 40 Ar-39 Ar age around ~4100-4000 Ma; Kaneoka et al., 1995), implying a weaker event. To summarize, Juvinas likely suffered severe impacts at 4320-4150 Ma and weaker reheating at ~4000 Ma. The metamorphic history of Juvinas can be ex- plained as follows: (i) original crystallization at 4563 Ma, (ii) ther- mal crustal metamorphism and formation of secondary zircons at ~4550 Ma, (iii) closure/reset of the apatite U-Pb system at ~4520 Ma through slow cooling or reheating, (iv) a later reset of the U-Pb system in merrillite <LATEX>a t \sim 4 1 5 0</LATEX> Ma through impact reheat- ing, and (v) a final disturbance of the <LATEX>K - A r</LATEX> system at ~4000 Ma possibly due to a weaker impact.
caos | The U-Pb systems in the Camel Donga apatite are severely dis- turbed. Even though the mean model <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> age was de- termined to be 4491.4 ± 13.5 Ma, the youngest outlier <LATEX>\left( C m d - 4 \right)</LATEX> recorded an age of <LATEX>4 3 7 2 \pm 2 6 M a</LATEX> (Fig. 4). No apparent cor- relation was observed between the <LATEX>2 0 7 p b * / 2 0 6 p b ^ { * }</LATEX> ages and the textural properties of the individual apatite grains (Figs. 2 and S2). The mean age of <LATEX>\sim 4 4 9 0 \quad M a</LATEX> is ~30 Myr younger than the <LATEX>2 0 7 p b ^ { * } | ^ { 2 0 6 } P b ^ { * }</LATEX> age of the Agoult apatite (4525 Ma; Fig. 4). This time <LATEX>\log \text { of } \sim 3 0 M</LATEX> between Camel Donga and Agoult is similar to the U-Pb systems in their zircons (Table 1: Camel Donga, <LATEX>4 5 3 1 \pm 1 0</LATEX> Ma; Agoult, <LATEX>4 4 5 4 . 5 \pm 2 . 0 M a</LATEX> Zhou et al., 2013; lizuka and oxides (Camel Donga, <LATEX>5 . 4 3 \pm 0 . 4 2 M a</LATEX> Agoult, 4532.39 ± 0.87 Ma; Iizuka et al., 2019). The 4490-Ma apatite is consis- tent with a previous interpretation that Camel Donga resided in a distinct region on the parent body and underwent the thermal metamorphism at crust ~20 Myr later than the other eucrites (lizuka et <LATEX>\left. a l . , 2 0 1 9 \right) .</LATEX> In addition, the presence of young apatite at <LATEX>4 3 7 2 \pm 2 6 \mathrm { M a }</LATEX> indicates that there was a distinct reheat- ing event at <LATEX>\sim 4 3 7 0 \quad M a ,</LATEX> which caused an incomplete disturbance of the U-Pb system. Conversely, the <LATEX>4 0 \quad A r - 3 9 \quad A r</LATEX> age in the Camel Donga plagioclase was completely reset at <LATEX>3 7 4 9 \pm 2 5 M a</LATEX> because of an independent impact (Iizuka et al., 2019). This last event at <LATEX>\begin{array}{} { \sim 3 7 5 0 \text { Na } } \\ { \text { thaush th } } \end{array}</LATEX> caused diffusion and brecciation of the host rock, even reheating temperature was not high enough to reset the U-Pb system in the apatite. To summarize, the metamorphic history of Camel Donga can be described as follows: (i) initial crys- tallization at 4564 Ma (Hublet et al., 2017), (ii) high-temperature thermal metamorphism in the crust at 4530 Ma, (iii) subsequent slow cooling until 4490 Ma, (iv) an additional impact causing an incomplete disturbance of the apatite U-Pb system at 4370 Ma, and (v) final impact brecciation at 3750 Ma, where only the K-Ar system was

In contrast to Juvinas, both the apatite and merrillite in Stan- nern yielded identical ages. This may be because the host rock of Stannern was reheated more homogeneously to the U-Pb re- set temperature. According to geochemical studies of the trace in- compatible element trends, the geological backgrounds of Stannern and Juvinas should be different, which means that they resided at different locations on Vesta (e.g., Barrat et al., 2007). Their identi- cal reheating ages of ~4150 Ma indicate that there were two (or more) impact events on Vesta during this period, where the re-
