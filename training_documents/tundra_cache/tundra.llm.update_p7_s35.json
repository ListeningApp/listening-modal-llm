        "content": "7fqw | The logistics of mapping at twenty centimeter resolution exacerbates uncertainty, especially in the context of such a finely heterogeneous landscape. At such a high resolution, unavoidable sub-meter errors in data collection and processing become important, but remain difficult to quantify. These errors might include small artifacts from imagery stitching and orthorectification; minor spatial variations in lidar ground-control adjustments; centimeter-level errors in GNSS base station location or RTK corrections; and slight mismatches in the location of a reference plot photo center and the measurement of its GNSS coordinates-any of which could displace a\nrhaz | reference plot into the wrong pixel and introduce noise into the modeling process. Indeed, the large difference between the value for kappa zero point four seven and weighted kappa zero point six five suggests that many misclassifications are attributable to small ecological gradient-related offsets or locational errors in the data.\nwak1 | Nonetheless, we believe that the high resolution of the maps, their relatively large extent, and the granularity of the classes offset the moderate map accuracy we were able to achieve, especially given the challenges inherent in any vegetation classification. For example, the gradient nature of vegetation communities can make class assignment for a plot ambiguous, since a given location may show characteristics of multiple vegetation communities. This might lead to two similar training plots being assigned to different classes based on an arbitrary distinction, introducing noise to the training data. The granularity of our classification scheme also increases opportunities for confusion. For example, there were five shrubby classes, many of which are structurally similar, as well as two common classes, Tussock Tundra and Moist Non-Tussock Tundra, that each had a corresponding 'Shrubby' class. These 'Shrubby' versions would only be differentiable from their non-shrubby counterparts based on the presence of sparse, low-stature shrubs, less than thirty centimeter height, which are difficult to detect in remotely sensed data. Nonetheless, we retained the granular classes because we believe the maps accurately reflect landscape vegetation patterns, and that this classification will be most valuable to map users.\nwtfz | Three point three. Predictor importance\nqy1i | Although the Random Forest approach is valuable for its flexibility and robustness, it provides only limited options for ecological interpretation of results. Variable importance metrics are derived by examining how much the accuracy, both class-wise and overall, changes when the model is run iteratively with the values of each predictor permuted, that is, randomly reordered among plots. However, variable importance metrics become less meaningful when input variables are highly correlated, so it is not advisable to interpret the variable importance values rigorously in this case.\n1k9e | With that caveat, some results are interesting. For example, lidar intensity was important to accuracy for several classes, with standard deviation of intensity especially important for very wet vegetated classes, Raised Areas in Wet Tundra, Wet Tundra, where the occurrence of intermixed high- and low-intensity pixels could indicate areas of intermixed vegetation and saturated microsites. Intensity smoothed at one meter was the predictor with the largest impact on the overall Gini purity index and was especially important for very dry vegetated classes, Dry Exposed Tundra, Dry Sheltered Tundra, where intensity would be high, and for Water, where intensity would be low. This adds to emerging evidence that lidar intensity can be an important ecological metric.\n5bjs | Greenness indices, NDVI, DSI, twoGRBI, were important for predicting all shrubby classes, as would be expected, and coarse-scale topographic position was important for predicting Low to Tall Moist Shrub, which generally occurs in low-lying streambed areas. Unsurprisingly, lidar-derived canopy height metrics were important for predicting Tall Shrub, and heat load index was important for predicting Moist Snowbed-but it\nuodj | was somewhat more surprising that percent red appeared important for predicting wet tundra classes, Wet Tundra, Raised Areas in Wet Tundra, and moist upland tundra classes, Moist Snowbed, Tussock Tundra, Moist Non-Tussock Tundra, perhaps owing to a comparatively high degree of red absorption by both water and plants in those areas. The standard deviation of the panchromatic, red plus green plus blue, although not at all important for most classes, was highly important for predicting Tussock Tundra, where high values may have indicated the distinctive speckled image texture created by tussock shadows. Indeed, in our early modeling attempts, which\nk16v | employed one meter spatial resolution rather than twenty centimeter, we found that models could not distinguish tussock tundra from non-tussock tundra, perhaps owing to dilution of this signal when averaged over a larger area.\nb2lm | Overall, in a list of fifteen most important predictors per class, all thirty-three predictors appear for at least one class; in a list of the five most important variables per class, only seven predictors fail to appear for at least one class, hue standard deviation, swi zero point five, swi one, ws zero point five, ws one, tpi twenty-five, and tpi fifty. Although this may be due in part to the correlated nature of many of the predictor variables, the wide variety of variables appearing as important for different classes also suggests the complicated interrelationships between vegetation communities and their ecological drivers.\nti7f | Three point four. Mapping\noksu | The final maps are four-bit unsigned integer twenty centimeter resolution rasters. Figure two shows the full extent of the Toolik map; figure three shows a detail from an area within the larger Toolik footprint. Full extents of the Pipeline and Imnavait maps are shown in figures four and five, respectively. Details from the Pipeline and Imnavait maps are included in the supplemental material. Minor flight-line artifacts are visible in a few areas, most notably in the southern portion of the Imnavait footprint; these artifacts are likely the result of sun-sensor geometry interacting with the vegetation canopy and the slope of the terrain, potentially along with slight inconsistencies in cloud cover between flight overpasses. The effect appears to cause some tussock tundra areas to be classified as Shrubby Moist Non-Tussock Tundra, presumably because the effect increased the apparent\nwtow | greenness at the outer margins of the flight line, while simultaneously reducing the prominence of tussock shadows. Overall, the maps correspond well to previous polygon maps of the area and to the authors' knowledge of the mapped landscapes.\no22k | Four. Conclusion\nnwfz | This project combined predictor datasets derived from two airborne sensors in a machine learning approach that permitted the construction of very high-resolution validated vegetation classification maps based on simple ground reference data. The approach highlights the ability of high-quality airborne data to produce very high-resolution geospatial data products over relatively large areas, providing an important link between limited-extent ground- and UAS-based remote sensing products and coarser geospatial data products covering larger extents. The maps should prove to be a valuable resource for Arctic researchers requiring fine-scale reference data for these important research landscapes.",
