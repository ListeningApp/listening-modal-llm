You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

ki0m | The second case is weird and interesting. It's named after Rolf Hagedorn, who in 1964 noticed that this was a possibility in nuclear physics. He considered a model of nuclear matter where the energies <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> approach <LATEX>+ \infty</LATEX> in a roughly logarithmic way. As you heat it, its expected energy keeps increasing, but its temperature can never exceed <LATEX>T _ { \mathrm { H } } .</LATEX> This model turned out to be incorrect, but <LATEX>\mathrm { i t } ^ { \gamma } \varsigma</LATEX> interesting anyway.
6wrx | Now let's solve some puzzles on systems with a countable infinity of states. Some of these show up in quantum mechanics, but you don't need to know quantum mechanics to do these puzzles.
u4q7 | Puzzle 27. Show that for a system with a countable infinity of states, if thermal equi- librium is possible for some negative temperature, it is impossible for positive or infinite temperatures.
jd7m | Puzzle 28. Work out the Boltzmann distribution when <LATEX>E _ { n } = n E</LATEX> for some energy <LATEX>E ,</LATEX> and show that it is well-defined for all temperatures
sknv | <LATEX>0 < T < + \infty .</LATEX> The next puzzle is a lot like the previous one a bit more messy, but worthwhile because of its great importance in physics.
usuw | Puzzle 29. For a system called the quantum harmonic oscillator of frequency <LATEX>\omega</LATEX> we have <LATEX>E _ { n } = \left( n + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \right) \hbar \omega ,</LATEX> where <LATEX>\hbar</LATEX> is the reduced Planck's constant. Work out the Boltzmann distribution in this case, and show it is well-defined for all temperatures
d4hr | <LATEX>0 < T < + \infty .</LATEX> Puzzle 30. For a system called the primon gas we have <LATEX>E _ { n } = E \ln n</LATEX> for some energy <LATEX>E .</LATEX> Show that the Boltzmann distribution is well-defined for small enough positive temperatures, but there is a Hagedorn temperature. Give a formula for the Boltzmann distribution in terms of the Riemann zeta function:
ph8j | <LATEX>\zeta \left( s \right) = \sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } n ^ { - s } .</LATEX> You can show that for the primon gas the sum <LATEX>\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> diverges at the Hagedorn temperature. But it can go the other way, too:
bemf | Puzzle 31. Find energies <LATEX>E _ { n }</LATEX> with a Hagedorn temperature such that <LATEX>\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \infty } \exp \left( - E _ { n } / k T \right)</LATEX> converges at the Hagedorn temperature.
s9l9 | Various other strange things can happen, as you should expect when dealing with infinite series. For example, it's possible that the Boltzmann distribution is well-defined at some temperature but the expected value of the energy is infinite! But I'll resist the lure of these rabbit holes and turn to something much more important: systems with a continuum of states. We will need to get good at these to compute the entropy of hydrogen. Now our sums become integrals, and various new things happen.
bs07 | THE FINITE VERSUS THE CONTINUOUS
y6eq | THE FINITE
0tl4 | THE CONTINUOUS
vbq2 | p a probability distribution on {1, . .. , n} Gibbs entropy Gibbs entropy
pfrt | p a probability distribution on R
iws8 | S(p) =- kpi In pi i=1 n = - k p(x) In p(x) dx
n452 | S(p) always ≥ 0 S(p) not always ≥ 0
ztct | S(p) always finite S(p) not always finite
enir | S(p) invariant under permutations of {1, . . . , n}
e4d4 | S(p) not invariant under reparametrizations of R
d8ta | You can switch from finite sums to integrals in the definition of entropy, and we'll need to do this to compute the entropy of hydrogen. But be careful: a bunch of things change!
c9cw | We need to switch from finite sums to integrals when we switch from a finite set of states to a measure space of states. I'll illustrate the ideas with the real line, R. We define a probability distribution on R to be an integrable function p: R -> [0, 0) with
b93o | Such a probability distribution has a Gibbs entropy given by
tjqy | S(p) = - k| 00 00 p(x) ln p(x) dx.
58xg | We can also define Shannon entropy, where we leave out Boltzmann's constant k and use whatever base we want for the logarithm:
70zf | H (p) = - p(x) log p(x) dx. .00
xnbe | I should warn you that many writers reserve the term 'Shannon entropy' only for a sum
uv86 | H (p) = - pi log pi. iEX
gksi | While that convention has advantages, I want to use the term 'Shannon entropy' to signal that I'm leaving out the factor of k.
oh7q | Unlike the entropy for a probability distribution on a finite set, the entropy of a probability distribution on R can be negative! This is disturbing. Earlier I said that the Shannon entropy of a probability distribution is the expected amount of information
6gn8 | you learn when an outcome is chosen according to that distribution. How can this be negative?
yun5 | The answer is that this interpretation of entropy, valid for probability distributions on a finite or even a countably infinite set, is not true in the continuous case! We have to adapt our intuitions.
vdx2 | Look at an example. Let Pe be the probability distribution on R given by
4k9e | P(x) = 0 otherwise.
keds | For small e it's a tall thin spike near 0. Let's work out its Shannon entropy: I(p) = - _ p(x) log p(x) dx
ugy5 | = -1 Jo € € 1 1 ϵ
yhw8 | - log - dx
o7zq | = log €.
hqd5 | We're just integrating a constant here, so it's easy. When € = 1 the entropy is zero, and when e becomes smaller than 1 the entropy becomes negative!
su3f | Why? We need a distance scale to define the entropy of a probability distribution on the real line. If I measure distance in centimeters, I'll think the entropy of a probability distribution is bigger than you, who measures it in meters. And if I measure it in kilometers, I'll think the entropy is smaller-and possibly even negative.
s1l7 | Let's see how this works. If I measure distance in different units from you, my coordinate y on the real line will not equal your coordinate x: instead we'll have y = cx
12yz | for some c > 0. Then my probability distribution, say q, will have
0xfx | q(y) dy = q(cx) d(x) = c q(x) dx -00 00 so we must have
bg91 | q(cx) = = p(x) 1
bsog | to make this integral equal 1. In other words, stretching out a probability distribution must also flatten it out, making it less 'tall'-and its entropy increases. Indeed:
o7e8 | Puzzle 32. Show that H(q) = H(p) + ln c.
xjy8 | Thanks to this formula choosing 0 < c < 1 compresses a probability distribution and makes it taller, reducing its entropy. Inevitably, this can make the entropy negative if c is small enough.
