You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Throughout the eighteenth century, formal alphabet lessons had been accompanied by needlework samplers repro- ducing the letters of the alphabet and didactic quotations. By the 1790s, however, as American literacy lessons were increasingly taking a geo-

p2n3 | Hannah Cockburn's sampler, for example, displays both her needle- work and her geographic knowledge as she faithfully imitates Morse's map-reading lesson by showing the border lines and names of the union and its states, including the "Twenty League Line" separating national from international waters (Figure 41). Mary Franklin's sampler, while de- picting both the North and South American continents, nonetheless ad- vertises the national form as the heavily traced border line of the nation- state distinguishes the political territory from its larger geographic con- text (Figure 42).41

gvwz | Both samplers demonstrate that, because the national map shaped the methodologies of formal literacy instruction, the nation's outline had be- come internalized and was now shaping practices of self-representation and political identification. The samplers' representation of the national territory-using blazes of color, thicker thread, or wider brush strokes- privileged the outline map as the recognizable sign through which young Americans were taught to express their national identity. The samplers' materiality even suggested that the text of the national map was begin- ning to be understood quite literally as the nation's material texture.

Americans thus appear to have viewed the cartographic image of the nation as more than a desirable consumer object. Considering the widespread circulation of national maps, citizens endowed the logo image with the kind of political- aesthetic value of "Americanness," which significantly would retain

bfax | and generate its sacred aura despite the fact that the logo was mass- produced.42
f2y8 | Central to this aura is that, emerging from within the postcolonial cul- ture, the map logo assumed the very communicative properties so eagerly sought after by the proponents of a new American language scheme. But while language reformers concentrated on the alphabetic construction of a newly nationalized English, it was through the everyday popular use of the national map that its territorial outline became an emblem rivaling the letters displayed in the ABC books. Instead of redefining the alphabet so that "A stands for America," mapmakers and pupils discovered in the map logo the ideal sign representing the nation unambiguously and in diverse textual contexts: the national outline literally became a legible sign, a ready-made icon that was easily transported into the process of mediation and national identification.
o7qm | Reduced to the shape of a logo, the map became the communicative agent through which a multitude of individuals were taught not only to imagine but to "read" themselves as parts of a national whole. Every time citizens recited "American" letters in spellers or drew or stitched the map image of the nation, they contemplated themselves as a local representa- tion contingent upon a national geography. If the outline map established the nation as a material artifact, then during the 1780s and 1790s it func- tioned as a sign that American citizens were trained to recognize as we today are trained to recognize the logo of McDonald's golden arches. The most compelling description of a realized and representative model of an American linguistic community derives from the fact that people as dif- ferent as John Jay and Hannah Cockburn simultaneously "read" the ver- nacular of the map logo. If nationalism invented the American people, it was common readers who inaugurated the nation by poring over geo- graphic texts that produced and reproduced their cultural community as a geographic reality, as a recognizable American sign.
