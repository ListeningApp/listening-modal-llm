Rejecting the FFIT based on poor applicability with the anthropometric surveys that influences how industry understands human measurements is radical. Meticulous examination is, therefore, essential. \nppqi | Three-D Body Scanning - following accepted I S O standards - takes measurements following different placement definitions than FFIT - loosely - dictates. Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan name the bust, waist, hip, stomach, and abdomen when developing FFIT, but omits replicable measurement definitions. Sokolowski and Bettencourt even state, â€˜Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan did not provide detailed descriptions of where on the scan these measurements were taken'. Instead, Simmons, Istook, and Devarajan primarily used the measurements programmed into the T C two anthropometric software - as their later work with Yim Lee describes. Unless a researcher seeking to use FFIT has the same T C two software, they must choose measurement within the stated regions, as Figure two shows.\noxou | The FFIT's definitions are potentially incompatible with the way Three-D Body Scanning's anthropometric software defines measurements as standard. This incompatibility may have serious consequences given the FFIT's common application to Three-D Body Scanning data. The FFIT used a hip measurement definition that allows the hip circumference to occur anywhere in a given zone (see Figure two), including above the seat. Hips cannot, anatomically, occur above the seat. This may be why SizeUK used the Seat in place of the Hip. The standard Three-D body scanning posture requires participants to keep their feet at least two hundred millimeters apart: 'standing position A' according to I S O twenty sixty eighty-five. Three-D Body Scanners require standing position A\n495n | (Figure three) to identify crotch and thigh geometry more accurately.\nawri | Nevertheless, 'standing position A' has a problem. Its wide feet position causes the largest circumference between crotch and waist to move, occurring at a position different from the hip level defined in I S O eight five five nine dash one. A person's measurements, therefore, change if the practitioner uses manual or Three-D Body Scanning measurement methods.\nbl28 | Practitioners are placing measurements on different parts of the body by using different measurement methods. If the different measurement methods can place the same body into a different shape classification, the impact may be severe. Two surveys - both using the FFIT shape classification tool but using different measurement methods - may reach conclusions about inter-group body shape differences that do not exist in reality. Researchers in these hypothetical studies may assume they classify bodies in the same way. This is because FFIT is not explicit on where to place measurements. FFIT also relies on measurements existing within zones (see Figure two) instead of precise placements. Even the most meticulous practitioners may, therefore, be measuring bodies at different locations without knowing it.\nd5bz | If this is true, then the FFIT - or any research that utilizes the FFIT - cannot be authoritative because of the FFIT's propensity for error caused by the effects of slight differences in measurement definitions. The published FFIT research does not, arguably, communicate the need for measurement definition standards to an adequate level. This is important because consistent results rely on practitioners applying consistent measurement definitions.\nap5o | Additionally, the FFIT only classifies a person's lower-torso region instead of the entire body, despite\n7zvf | research using the FFIT for this purpose. In defining the body, the FFIT only uses six circumferences in the region from the bust to the hip. The restricted body form consideration limits how the FFIT might inform pattern construction because it excludes measurements in the critical upper-body control zone/the shoulders' anchor area. Unlike earlier body classification systems - for example, Rasband - the FFIT's shape sorting formulae excludes shoulder anthropometry. Shoulder measurement's exclusion is surprising as they are essential for clothing design and construction. The FFIT's suitability for garment construction, and apparel-related purposes, is unsubstantiated.\nmov9 | FFIT defines the bust in line with I S O definitions. However, as Figure two shows, the waist and hip are defined as occurring within zones. Within these zones, measurements can fall into regions that they would not naturally occur within. For example, the hip can occur anywhere from the crotch to the waist, including above the seat. For all definitions, this can never be classified as the hip as the seat (a circumference at maximum buttock projection) should be the upper limit. Because FFIT omits clear measurement definitions, differently defined measurements sharing the same name are likely to be applied to the published shape calculations; as with Sokolowski and Bettencourt.\nks7m | While the FFIT may have specific measurements, these measurements are unavailable - and unreplicable - to the broader ergonomic field. The measurement extract is specific to T C two's Scanner software and hardware. As measurements are used interchangeably by name,\nw1w1 | two practitioners will likely use such alternative measurements - such as SizeUK - while attempting to replicate FFIT. Sokolowski and Bettencourt even modifies FFIT to address the underlying assumptions about measurement placement that cannot work on women over size fourteen. However, these placement assumptions are invisible to third-party practitioners who do not run studies 'hacking' the algorithm. If using alternative measurements reclassifies bodies into different shapes, then FFIT is unauthoritative outside of its original application because of unreplicable measurement definitions. In such a situation, ergonomists who attempt to use the FFIT system in their work may not, therefore, be able to compare their work to others - but they are unaware of these underlying issues.\nh8gv | We aim to assess the FFIT's suitability as a body classification system for scientific research and garment construction purposes, considering how slight changes in measurement definitions may affect shape classifications. We use FFIT as the case by which to explore how body shape systems may provide unreliable when used more broadly than specified systems and measurements extractions. In pursuing this aim, we consider the following hypotheses:\nkwkp | One. Calculating the FFIT using alternative measurement definitions causes the same human shape to be categorized as alternative body shapes, with a low - below fifty percent - agreement between measurement definition groups.\n```",
