You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

bnve | 483 increases in the insoluble fraction relative to the soluble fraction (Ckmt1, Tau, Taf15, and
7gvc | 484 Hspb1) and one protein which significantly increases in the soluble fraction and showed no
jf19 | 485 change in the insoluble fraction (Plk2) (Fig 4I). Of note, Taf15 has previously been observed in 486 detergent-insoluble fractions of brains from Alzheimer's patients, correlated with both Amyloid
6hx6 | 487 ß and Tau insolubility(98-101). Ckmt1 has also been found in Neurofibrillary tangles and interacting with phosphorylated Tau inclusions(102-104).
xcql | 488
xcxb | 489 490 Neuroproteasomes are differentially regulated by ApoE isoforms to determine formation of 491 endogenous sarkosyl-insoluble Tau inclusions
ci51 | 492
jaj7 | 493 Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a fraction of endogenous mouse Tau becomes
uc0w | 494 sarkosyl-insoluble following neuroproteasome inhibition. We sought to validate these findings
494y | 495 by immunoblot and extend them to determine if the same principle would hold for human Tau 496 isoforms, without pathogenic and aggregation-driving mutations. We therefore cultured primary
5whs | 497 mouse cortical neurons from either WT or hTau-KI mice (105). The entire mouse Mapt sequence
kigc | 498 is replaced with the human Mapt sequence (including upstream gene regulatory elements) at the
k5st | 499 endogenous locus in hTau-KI mice. hTau-KI mice express all six human isoforms of Tau protein
d8e8 | 500 using the endogenous Mapt regulatory elements and therefore, hTau is expressed at normal 501 physiological levels(105). DIV12-14 neurons were treated with either the neuroproteasome
gb7b | 502 inhibitor iBEp or the cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor Epoxomicin. We then performed
jxu0 | 503 sarkosyl fractionations to separate treated neurons into soluble and insoluble fractions and
l1bb | 504 immunoblotted these fractions for total Tau and GAPDH. The R2295 antibody reacts against 505 both total human and total mouse Tau and is highly specific, making it the ideal tool to monitor
i3e0 | 506 endogenous Tau in WT and hTau-KI samples(106). We observed no Tau signal in primary
78dj | 507 neurons cultured from Tau knockout (Tau-KO) mice, demonstrating the specificity of our
c1pj | 508 antibodies and approach (Fig S5A)(106). We found a significant increase in sarkosyl-insoluble
6v9y | 509 Tau from both the WT (Fig 5A) and hTau-KI neurons treated with iBEp (Fig 5B, S5B).
deen | 510 Intriguingly, we find no change in sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in neurons treated with the cell-
27bo | 511 permeable Epoxomicin compared to DMSO controls, despite the fact that Epoxomicin inhibits
72k6 | 512 cytosolic proteasomes and neuroproteasomes (Fig 5A,B). We reason that Epoxomicin inhibits
emhp | 513 neuroproteasomes and likely induces the formation of Tau inclusions (similar to iBEp), but these
tcgw | 514 Tau inclusions cannot be detected because simultaneous inhibition of cytosolic proteasomes
4d8s | 516 induces autophagy and other compensatory mechanisms which can clear these inclusions. This
1cmq | 515
u8s6 | 517 claim is supported by an extensive body of work on Tau clearance mechanisms(31-35, 93). We
86m5 | 518 posit that such compensatory mechanisms are not triggered when neuroproteasomes are
lzzv | 519 specifically inhibited, which is consistent with our observations that Epoxomicin induces p62 expression whereas iBEp does not (Fig 4D, G).
623p | 520
50lp | 521 Many of our experiments rely on the use of iBEp because the biotin tracer on an irreversible and
i4nn | 522 specific inhibitor allows us to track which proteasomes are inhibited. However, we wanted to
nuk3 | 523 validate our findings using a proteasome inhibitor with a distinct mechanism of action from
y2cn | 524 Epoxomicin. We therefore modified MG132, a reversible peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, with a sulfonated biotin linker on the nonreactive N-terminus(84). This negatively charged 526 water-soluble linker renders Sulfo-MG132 (SulfoMG) cell-impermeable, much like the historical
hgm4 | 525
nc42 | 527 use of sulfonated linkers to perform surface biotinylation (Fig 5C). We observe efficient 528 conjugation by HPLC analysis (Fig S5C, D). All molecules were HPLC-purified as single peaks 529 530 and confirmed by LC/MS analysis (Fig S5E, F). We find significant inhibition of proteasomes using SulfoMG despite the moderate loss of efficacy compared to MG132 as a consequence of
tbfm | 531 the linker (Fig S5G). MG132 is a reversible inhibitor and therefore, we cannot detect the
ok18 | 532 covalent modification of the proteasome subunits. Instead, we turned to cellular and functional
pgqe | 533 readouts of permeability. We found a similar induction of autophagy markers in neurons treated 534 with MG132 as with epoxomicin and a similar lack of induction with SulfoMG as with iBEp 535 (Fig 5C). Confident in its use as a chemically orthogonal cell-impermeable proteasome inhibitor, 536 we next incubated DIV13 primary hTau-KI neurons with SulfoMG. We find that SulfoMG 537 induces similar partitioning of hTau into the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction as iBEp (Fig 5D).
qo9m | 538
e7zz | 539 Moreover, we find that MG132, like Epoxomicin, does not affect the sarkosyl-insoluble accumulation of Tau (Fig 5D).
lhzk | 540
wdpw | 541 Next, we examined whether neuroproteasome inhibition would induce sarkosyl-insoluble
twiq | 542 endogenous Tau inclusions in vivo. Here, we only used iBEp and not SulfoMG for three reasons: 543 first, because SulfoMG is reversible and is therefore subject to being washed out by CSF flow in
cchx | 544 vivo; second, because we could biochemically monitor iBEp permeability using the presence of
2vma | 545 the biotin signal; and third, because Epoxomicin is a more specific proteasome inhibitor than
z4aw | 546 MG132. We tested iBEp permeability in vivo by stereotactically injecting iBEp into the CA1 547 region of the mouse hippocampus for 72 hours. Hippocampi were microdissected and separated 548 549 into cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions and samples were immunoblotted (Fig 5E). We fail to observe penetration into the cytosol until we inject 64uM, so we chose to inject at 10-fold
mo0p | 550 under this dose as our maximal concentration (Fig 5E). This in vivo dose is consistent with and
tyxr | 551 far lower than previous studies using Epoxomicin alone (9.0 and 13.5mM (107, 108)). We
txaa | 552 performed stereotactic injections of 6.4 uM iBEp and contralateral injections of the vehicle
qz8s | 553 (0.07% DMSO) into the hippocampus of hTau-KI and Tau-KO mice. After 72 hours, we
y7de | 554 collected the hippocampi and performed sarkosyl extractions into soluble and insoluble fractions.
rukn | 555 We fail to observe any detectable Tau in the Tau-KO mice in DMSO- or iBEp-injected
5tu7 | 556 hippocampi (Fig S5H). Mirroring our data in primary neurons, we find a strong increase of
vqgg | 557 sarkosyl-insoluble Tau in hippocampi from hTau-KI mice injected with iBEp (Fig 5F).
