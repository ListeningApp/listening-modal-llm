The causal pie model has fulfilled this role in epidemiology and could be of similar value in evolutionary biology and ecology. In the causal pie model, outcomes result from sufficient causes. Each sufficient cause is made up of a \"causal pie\" of \"component causes\". Several different causal pies may exist for the same outcome. If and only if all component causes of a sufficient cause are present, that is, a causal pie is complete, does the outcome occur. The effect of a component cause hence depends on the presence of the other component causes that constitute some causal pie. Because all component causes are equally and fully causative for the outcome, the sum of causes for some outcome exceeds one hundred. The causal pie model provides a way of thinking that maps into a number of recurrent themes in evolutionary biology and ecology: It charts when component causes have an effect and are subject to natural selection, and how component causes affect selection on other component causes; which partitions of outcomes with respect to causes are feasible and useful; and how to view the composition of an apparently homogeneous population. The diversity of specific results that is directly understood from the causal pie model is a test for both the validity and the applicability of the model. The causal pie model provides a common language in which results across disciplines can be communicated and serves as a template along which future causal analyses can be made.\nccmb | of applications, from semi-neutral mutations to agents of selection.\nma93 | The Model\nc6hh | To paraphrase Rothman, the lights at home shine because they each have a light bulb, there is wire to the light bulbs, the switches are on, there is a power grid, and there is a power source. Take any of these factors away, and there is no light: The system contains five hundred causality, for all five factors are one hundred causative for the shining of the light. There is no limit to the sum of causes for some outcome.\ny7ea | The causal pie model, depicted in Figure one after Rothman's original, represents this way of conceptualizing\nnav4 | causality. A sufficient cause is a constellation of component causes, the causal pie, that leads to an outcome. A component cause can be a component of more than one sufficient cause. If and only if all the component causes that make up a causal pie of some sufficient cause are present does the outcome occur. As a result, the effect of a component cause depends on the presence versus absence of the other component causes that make up some causal pie. These are called complementary component causes, which jointly make up the complementary set of a component cause. In the absence of any one of the complementary component causes, a component cause in itself has no effect. Referring to the example above, if there is no connection to the power grid, varying the position of the switch does not alter the light being on or off.\ngem8 | This model is deterministic in the sufficient causes: If all component causes of some causal pie are present, then the sufficient cause is present and the outcome occurs. This does not prohibit the model from having statistical properties: If one or more of the component causes is described statistically, the joint distribution function of the mixed statistical model describes the outcome as a random variable.\ne8nr | The level of detail required for an analysis determines the biologic outcome of interest, the number of sufficient causes that can exist for the same biologic outcome, and what component causes make up the sufficient causes. For instance, a stroke that is caused by high blood pressure may be classified as an outcome different from a stroke that is not caused by high blood pressure. The latter clearly does not include sufficient causes that contain high blood pressure as a component cause, while the outcome \"any stroke\" would.\nk78w | As discussed above, causality adds up to more than one hundred. Variation in the occurrence of an outcome due to\ng9du | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution\nf682 | variation in a specified component cause is bound by one hundred. To illustrate this, consider another example: The disease phenylketonuria, P K U, is characterized by abnormal metabolism of an amino acid, leading to severe symptoms such as mental retardation. P K U occurs only in people with a mutated gene. The various human diets on planet Earth include the amino acid, so that one hundred of the occurrence versus nonoccurrence of P K U on planet Earth is explained genetically. However, consider a hypothetical \"other planet\", the inhabitants of which all have the genetic mutation, but do not all have a diet that contains the amino acid. On the other planet, one hundred of the observed variation in the occurrence of P K U is explained by variation in the diet.\nli1k | Variation explained is a matter of prevalence of component causes given some context. Although the percentage of variation explained might be of interest, of even greater interest are statements that are generally true, not just on planet Earth or on the other planet. Such a statement is that one hundred percent of the incident cases of P K U is caused by a mutant gene and one hundred percent is caused by diet. On planet Earth, variation in the prevalence of P K U is explained by genes. Yet, it is another component cause, diet, that is targeted as a treatment. This illustrates why general insights into causality are the more interesting kind of insights.\npbea | Application of the Model to Evolutionary Biology and Ecology\nccpt | The causal pie model has a number of implications for evolutionary biology and ecology: It charts under what circumstances component causes have an effect and therefore can be subject to natural selection, and how component causes modulate the effect of and natural selection on other component causes; it shows which partitions of outcomes are useful and which are not; and it provides a way of viewing the composition of an apparently homogeneous population. Each of these points is developed below, and examples are given and framed in terms of the causal pie model.\n0fpw | Component causes, their effects, and the force of selection\ndqn8 | The causal pie model explains when and why biologic factors, component causes, have an effect. When component causes produce an effect, they could affect Darwinian fitness and hence become subject to natural selection. Component causes also influence whether other component causes have an effect and become subject to natural selection. We outline some generalities regarding this thinking,\ncop0 | Causal Pies in Ecology and Evolution\nlhkq | and give examples, which are framed in terms of the causal pie model.",
