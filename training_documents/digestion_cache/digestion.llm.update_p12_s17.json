Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\ny8fb | Each gill filament drops ventrally, the descending limb, from the central axis and then climbs dorsally, the ascending limb. The ascending lamellae attach either to the mantle skirt, lateral filaments, or the visceral mass, medial filaments.\n521q | Water, blue arrows, is propelled between the filaments by the beating lateral cilia.\nyogo | Food particles are shifted to the frontal cilia, red arrows, which transport them to the labial palps. After Silvester and Sleigh.\n2285 | In the majority of bivalves, adjacent filaments are held together by junctions; this gill type is known as eulamellibranch. In more primitive bivalves, mussels and scallops, neighbouring gill filaments are attached to one another simply through interlocking clumps of cilia; this gill type is known as filibranch. Together, these filaments form a lamella. Therefore, each gill has four lamellae. The combined descending limbs of all the lateral filaments together form a descending lamella and the ascending filaments form an ascending lamella. Captured food is passed into longitudinal ciliated food grooves formed along the dorsal and ventral edges of the lamella.\nys0g | Module BL five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\n7zvp | Lamellibranch gill.\nww6u | Each filament is folded into a V shape. There are two Vs, demibranchs, one medial and one lateral to the central axis. Together these form a W shaped holobranch.\nhpi6 | One point one two Food sorting\n4uhb | The food grooves of the gill lamellae are located on their dorsal and ventral edges. A maximum of five such grooves, two ventral and three dorsal, are associated with each holobranch.\nepyi | In mussels and pen clams, food and sediment particles are transported both ventrally and dorsally, mostly ventrally, by frontal cilia to the five anteriorly directed food grooves which carry them to the labial palps. Very little sorting occurs in these species. In less advanced lamellibranchs, such as the Arcidae, Ark clams, Anomiidae, saddle oysters, Ostreidae, true oysters, and Pectinidae, scallop, the gills sort food from sediment. In these groups, tracts of frontal cilia transport food particles ventrally to the three anteriorly directed food grooves, while sediment particles are transported dorsally to the two ventral tracts which are directed posteriorly. Sediment and mucus are then ejected as pseudofaeces.\ny51p | One point two The role of the labial palps in feeding\nx95m | Particles are graded for size by the ciliated labial palps before being ingested.\nyfum | Module BL five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\nppx4 | Ridge cilia generate a current across the ridges, towards the mouth. Slope cilia beat downwards towards the groove. Groove cilia generate a current towards the edge of the palp.\nqf11 | Sediment particles which are rejected are transported to the edge of the lamellae in the grooves between the ridges and fall as pseudofaeces into the mantle cavity. This material, which consists of particles and mucus, is moved posteriorly in a ventral ciliary tract on the inner surface of the mantle skirt to a position close to the inhalant syphon. Occasional rapid contractions of the adductor muscles compress the mantle cavity and force water and pseudofaeces out of the inhalant syphon. Excess food material is removed by the labial palps in order to prevent gill saturation. In dense suspensions, the palps channel most of the filtered material away from the mouth and towards incorporation into pseudofaeces so that the animal can continue to filter and ingest at an optimum rate.\n8oqt | The mucus food string from the labial palps enters the mouth and is transported by cilia posteriorly through the oesophagus to the stomach.\n6zah | Two. Digestion\n4v5o | The digestive strategy of bivalve molluscs is unique among higher animals because both extracellular and intracellular digestion are important. The mouth of bivalves has foliar lips which may be folded and meshed, for example, in scallops. The short oesophagus leads into the stomach which is irregular and complex in form with highly folded ciliated walls. The stomach extends posteriorly, surrounded by digestive caeca, which form the digestive gland, into the intestine, rectum, and anus.\nha9e | Module BL five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\nxrnt | Two point one The stomach\nc8ra | Cilia and mucus are just as important in the gut as in the mantle cavity. The stomach is generally elaborate, with large ciliary sorting areas and a long rotating style.\np1l0 | The oesophagus enters the stomach anteriorly and the intestine exits posteriorly. Evaginations in the stomach wall form the gastric ceca, diverticula. These give rise to the digestive ceca, diverticula, ducts which are associated with ciliary sorting fields, consisting of ciliated ridges and grooves, similar to those in the labial palps.\n1i8b | Module BL five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\n5sfj | The sorting fields move large particles over the crests of the ridges; smaller mineral particles are collected in the grooves and moved to rejection tracts. The rejecting tracts move material to the intestine while food particles tend to be re-suspended in the fluid in the stomach.\nvk4h | A ciliated intestinal groove extends from the stomach into the intestine. The left side of the groove is bordered by a ciliated ridge, the major typhlosole, which arches over the groove and partially isolates it from the stomach. Another ridge, the minor typhlosole, lies on the right side of the intestinal groove. The major typhlosole and intestinal groove originate in the left gastric cecum and extend into the intestine, together with the minor typhlosole. The typhlosole and intestinal groove provide a continuous stream of mineral particles out of the stomach and into the intestine.\nnsm3 | A style sac with a ciliated secretory epithelium extends posteriorly from the stomach. The epithelium secretes the crystalline style which consists of a protein matrix onto which are secreted a variety of digestive enzymes, including amylases, glycogenases, lipases, and cellulases. There are no proteases in the stomach, since these would digest the proteinaceous enzymes of the style; protein digestion is intracellular in the digestive ceca.\njdfw | The cilia of the style sac cause the style to rotate, resulting in its abrasion and release of digestive enzymes which perform extracellular digestion. Rotation of the style stirs the contents of the stomach and drags the mucus food string through the oesophagus. Acid released from the style and digestive ceca reduces the pH of the stomach fluid and this reduces the viscosity of the mucus, releasing bound food particles onto the sorting fields.\nuc9r | Module BL five eight zero one Nutrition. Topic one: Feeding and digestion - invertebrates Jonathan David\nl0ap | Digestion in the diverticulae is completed and fragmentation spherules begin to form. The movement of fragmentation spherules to the stomach starts the next cycle. From Morton.\nx815 | Partially digested food passes into the digestive ceca via the gastric ceca. The digestive ceca ramify into secondary ducts that terminate in blind-ending pouches, acini. The acinar epithelium is responsible for enzyme secretion, nutrient absorption, pinocytosis and intracellular digestion.",
