We get\ndak5 | the average energy equals one-half n k T\n57sj | So, each degree of freedom still contributes a k T to the expected energy. That's the equipartition theorem!\nqdqk | But be careful. The equipartition theorem doesn't apply when the energy is an arbitrary function of n variables. It also fails when we switch from classical to quantum statistical mechanics.\nemd4 | People sometimes memorize the conclusion of the equipartition theorem, E equals two n k T, without learning that it holds only for classical systems whose energy is a positive definite quadratic form. These people sometimes get fooled into thinking the average energy is always proportional to T. Some of these poor benighted souls go around saying that temperature is just a measure of energy per degree of freedom. This completely ignores the subtlety of the concept of temperature.\nm9fu | As we've seen, the truly general relation between temperature and energy, for systems in thermal equilibrium, also involves entropy:\nb3ph | T d S equals d E.\n9j3h | THE AVERAGE ENERGY OF AN ATOM\nq1lo | Since an atom of helium gas can move in three directions, and its energy depends quadratically on its velocity and not on position, the equipartition theorem says that classically its expected energy should be\nbiqi | the average energy equals negative k T two-thirds\nxl19 | where T is temperature and k is Boltzmann's constant, about one point three eight times ten to the negative twenty-three joules per kelvin.\nj83k | So, heating an atom of helium gas one degree Celsius should take\nnle2 | three\n19po | times one point three eight times ten to the negative twenty-three joules equals two point zero seven times ten to the negative twenty-three joules\nsx65 | two\nilzn | This is very close to the truth.\nuzp0 | We can finally start reaping the rewards of all our thoughts about entropy! The equipartition theorem lets us estimate how much energy it takes to heat up one atom of helium one degree Celsius. And it works!\nyq4x | Of course we don't heat up an individual atom: we heat up a bunch. A mole of helium is about six point zero two times ten to the twenty-third atoms, so heating up a mole of helium one degree Celsius equals one kelvin should take about\ni901 | six point zero two times ten to the twenty-third times two point zero seven times ten to the negative twenty-three is approximately twelve point four six joules\nn98j | And this is very close to correct! It seems the experimentally measured answer is twelve point six joules.\nxgyu | What are the sources of error? Most importantly, our calculation neglects the interaction between helium atoms. Luckily this is very small at standard temperature and pressure. We're also neglecting quantum mechanics. Luckily for helium this too gives only small corrections at standard temperature and pressure.\nue40 | It's important here that helium is a monatomic gas. In hydrogen, which is a diatomic gas, we get extra energy because this molecule can tumble around, not just move along. We'll try that next.\ntq0f | THE ENERGY OF HYDROGEN\n3z1s | If we treat a molecule of hydrogen as a dumbbell whose position takes three numbers and whose axis takes two numbers to describe, we can try to use the equipartition theorem to estimate its expected energy as\nune6 | the average energy equals negative k T five-halves\neroy | where T is temperature and k equals one point three eight times ten to the negative twenty-three joules per kelvin.\nb09g | In this approximation, heating a molecule of hydrogen gas one kelvin takes\npsuf | two times one point three eight times ten to the negative twenty-three joules equals three point four five times ten to the negative twenty-three joules\nojfh | In reality it takes three point three nine times ten to the negative twenty-three joules at standard temperature and pressure. Not bad!\nqri0 | A molecule of hydrogen gas is a blurry quantum thing, but let's pretend it's a classical solid dumbbell that can move and tumble but not spin around its axis. Then it has three plus two equals five degrees of freedom, and we can use the equipartition theorem to estimate its energy.\nhbbb | For T significantly less than six thousand kelvin, hydrogen molecules don't vibrate with the two atoms moving toward and away from each other. They don't spin around their axis until even higher temperatures. But they tumble like a dumbbell as soon as T exceeds about ninety kelvin.\nuy56 | We need quantum mechanics to compute these things. But at room temperature and pressure, we can pretend a hydrogen gas is made of classical solid dumbbells that can move around and tumble but not spin around their axes! In this approximation the equipartition theorem tells us the average energy equals five k T.\nsy3k | This is fine as far as it goesâ€”but our goal in this course is to compute the entropy of hydrogen. We'll start with a useful warmup: the classical harmonic oscillator.\nido2 | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: ONE\nuq3f | A classical harmonic oscillator has energy\nc006 | equals p squared over two m\nyatc | where q is its position, p its momentum, m its mass and k its spring constant.\nny4k | By the equipartition theorem, in thermal equilibrium at temperature T it has expected energy the average energy equals k T where k is Boltzmann's constant.\netr7 | So, using d E equals T d S, its entropy is\n3m6c | S equals integral of d E over T equals k times the integral of one over T.\nh1un | Since this does not approach zero as T approaches zero from above, the Third Law of Thermodynamics doesn't hold for the classical harmonic oscillator.\nnljo | But what is this constant C? For that we must think harder.\nookx | What's the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium? Using the equipartition theorem and the formula d E equals T d S, we can show it's\n0h9f | So, the entropy grows logarithmically with temperature. And it does not go to zero as T approaches zero: instead, it goes to negative infinity. So the Third Law of Thermodynamics does not hold for the classical harmonic oscillator!\na5nf | That may seem shocking, but it actually makes sense. The Third Law holds only for certain special systems. Furthermore, we've seen that the entropy of a sharply peaked probability distribution on a continuous state space is negative. We'll see that the Boltzmann distribution for the classical oscillator gets more and more sharply peaked near q equals p equals zero as the temperature approaches zero from above. So in fact, it makes perfect sense that the entropy approaches negative zero.\nhtog | However, the classical harmonic oscillator is just an approximation to the quantum harmonic oscillator, which does obey the Third Law. It's a good approximation at high temperatures, but bad at low temperatures. In fact, this business of negative entropies at low temperature is not something that happens in the real world. It's just a defect of classical mechanics. It's trying to tell us that quantum mechanics is better.\nd9zz | Another point: you'll have noticed that constant C here. What is it? We can make progress with a bit of dimensional analysis. The quantity ln T is a funny thing: if we change our units of temperature, it doesn't get multiplied by a constant factor, the way\neovv | physical quantities usually do. It changes by adding a constant! So k ln T doesn't have dimensions of entropy. But\nf6vi | must have dimensions of entropy. The constant C must somehow save the day! How does that work? Let's see.\n```",
