You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

jt0y | BAD-corrected estimates of the ASB ES allow to visualize the magnitude of allelic imbalance at different positions of significant motif hits. To this purpose, we introduce a staveplot (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7) that is partitioned into sections corre- sponding to the motif positions, and each section is a stave of four strings denoting the minor allele. Individual ASBs are shown as the beads on the staves, with the major allele encoded with color, following the palette of the motif logo diagram that is shown underneath. As an illustrative example, we use ASBs of the CEBPB TF (Fig. 4d). For example, the first string from the left denotes A as the minor allele found in the first position of CEBPB motif hits. The string carries multiple beads, each of which is the major allele of a particular heterozygous SNV within an ASB site of CEBPB. The position of a bead on the Y-axis shows the ASB ES in log-scale. The most conserved motif positions 3-7-9-10 are almost unicolor, with the major allele usually being the same as the consensus letter in the motif (hence the beads on the strings depicting minor alleles mostly share the color of the preferred major allele). Lowly conserved positions (e.g., 1 or 12) allow for more options with various pairwise combinations of alleles (i.e., with minor allele strings carrying the beads of all four possible colors). Of note, the staveplot reveals a clear pattern where beads found in core motif positions are located generally higher, i.e., marking a greater ES for heterozygous variants at conserved motif
qb7o | positions. This agrees with the commonly accepted testimony that substitutions in the core motif positions bring about larger changes in TF-binding affinity.
oae5 | Particularly for CEBPB, position 6 is of special interest: it displays frequent T/C ASBs with C being the major allele. These cytosines belong to the core CG pair which is prone to spontaneous deamination. The produced mismatches are then protected from repair through enhanced CEBPB binding resulting in mutation fixation34. Such ASBs, on the one hand, confirm frequent mutagenesis of CEBPB binding sites, and, on the other hand, suggest the action of purifying selection that stabilizes such sites as heterozygous variants. The staveplots for other TFs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.
s0fl | Machine learning predicts ASBs from sequence analysis and chromatin accessibility. With previously published ASB sets of smaller volumes, it was possible to predict ASB from chromatin properties and a sequence analysis20. To assess to what degree this holds for ADASTRA data, we applied machine learning with a random forest model35 atop experimentally determined allele- specific chromatin DNase accessibility data16, predicted allele- specific chromatin profile from DeepSEA11, and sequence motif hits (Supplementary Table 5).
43ia | A generic classification problem (ASBs vs non-ASBs) can be formalized in two subtasks: (1) general assessment, i.e., to predict if an SNV makes the ASB for any of the TFs or in any of the cell types, and (2) TF- and cell type-specific assessment, i.e., to predict if an SNV makes the ASB for the particular TF or in the particular cell type. Models for both subtasks were trained and validated using multiple single-chromosome hold-outs: iteratively for each of 22 autosomes, one autosome was selected for validation, and 21 other autosomes were used for training. At each iteration, the model performance was estimated at the held-out autosome, and the resulting ROC and PRC were averaged.
3g2y | For the first subtask, the performance at TF and cell type ASBs was 0.74 and 0.73 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC), and 0.44 and 0.56 for the area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC), respectively (see the plots in Supplementary Fig. 8). For the second subtask, we used the top 10 TFs and top 10 cell types with the highest numbers of ASBs, and a dedicated model was trained for each TF and each cell type (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8). The quality of the models was different for different TFs and cell types, with the highest auROC of 0.72 and 0.81 for CTCF (of TFs) and HepG2 (of cell types), and the highest auPRC of 0.35 and 0.64 for CTCF and A549. Of note, RAD21 ASBs were also predicted with
