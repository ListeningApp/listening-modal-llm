At any time or place, individuals can be transported into immersive and interactive virtual worlds that are fully controlled by the researcher or clinician. This capability is central to recent interest in how V R might be harnessed in both treatment and assessment of mental health conditions. The current review provides a summary of the advantages of using V R for assessment in mental health, focusing on increasing ecological validity of highly controlled environments, enhancing personalization and engagement, and capturing real-time, automated data in real-world contexts. Considerations for the implementation of V R in research and clinical settings are discussed, including current issues with cost and access, developing evidence base, technical challenges, and ethical implications. The opportunities and challenges of V R are important to understand as researchers and clinicians look to harness this technology to improve mental health outcomes.\n2e62 | Introduction\n75y3 | Developments in virtual reality, V R, have the potential to radically transform the landscape of assessment in mental health. Immersive V R involves wearing an enclosed head-mounted device that displays three dimensional images on a screen so that the person is fully immersed in a virtual environment, for example, Figure one. Images are continuously rendered relative to the position of the head and can capture movements of the body, allowing users to explore and interact with objects and avatars, digital agents, in the virtual space. These virtual environments are either programmed using specialist software to create computer-generated, photorealistic images, or filmed with specialized cameras to create three hundred sixty degree videos of real-world\ns2g2 | scenes that can be replayed within V R. Together, these capabilities make it possible for researchers and clinicians to observe and record individuals in highly controlled and near-natural environments, in real time.\nq1q2 | V R has been applied for the delivery of exposure-based treatments, whereby individuals can experience feared situations or contexts in a safe and controlled manner, without leaving the clinical setting. Indeed, V R exposure treatments have proven effective across a range of mental health conditions. A number of reviews have been written on the topic of V R-based treatments for psychiatric conditions more broadly. Freeman and others conducted a systematic review in twenty seventeen, finding one hundred fifty-four studies on V R treatments for a range of mental health disorders. Further reviews\ncb7r | have been published on V R treatments for schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and mental disorders more generally. Evidence for the efficacy of V R treatments is noted within these reviews; however, the methodological quality of studies is generally low and the implementation of V R treatments beyond research settings is yet to be examined. Exposure therapy is notably dominant within this literature, highlighting how the ability of V R to recreate real-world environments has been leveraged to target the mechanism underpinning exposure. However, in general, innovation has not moved far from this approach, with more novel clinical applications of V R yet to be explored. One such application of V R within treatment is its use as a clinical assessment tool, a topic of relatively limited discussion within the literature. Clinical assessment is an integral element of mental health treatment, from diagnosis to treatment planning and monitoring. As such, the aim of this review is to orient the reader to the clinical application of V R as an assessment tool within mental health research and practice. The specific capabilities that underlie the utility of V R for clinical assessment is provided, as well as examples from\n68xu | high-quality research studies, finishing with a discussion of current considerations and limitations in the field.\nhd35 | Benefits of virtual reality for assessment\n2zpk | From symptoms and cognition to functioning and capacity, the measurement of psychological phenomena is central to research and practice in mental health. Although we can have confidence in current assessment instruments to a certain degree, there are many threats to reliability and validity. Differences between the assessment context, for example, a lab or clinic, and the real world generate multiple sources of potential bias, threatening the accuracy of results. Real-world assessments are possible, but can be costly and time consuming, and access can be limited by location and mobility. V R may overcome many of these limitations through the ability to generate highly controlled, real-world experiences.\nepu7 | Enhancing ecological validity\n7od1 | With technological advances over the past decade in particular, V R has become increasingly immersive. By immersing individuals in real-world situations through V R, it is possible to conduct assessments that more closely emulate what happens in daily life. This capability overcomes the issue of ecological validity, that is, the degree to which the findings of research studies generalize to real-world settings. Research has consistently shown that individuals respond to virtual environments as if they were experiencing them in real life. Virtual environments are known to produce physiological changes consistent with emotional responses to real-world scenarios and have the ability to elicit symptoms such as paranoia, cravings, anxiety, and fear. A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials comparing V R exposure with in vivo exposure for phobias found equivalent effects for both interventions, suggesting similar processes occur. Experiences in V R have also been found to elicit predictable behaviors, with one study finding that people with higher levels of paranoia kept a greater interpersonal distance from avatars within a virtual environment, which was considered a reflection of perceived trust and social threat. These findings highlight one of the main advantages of V R within mental health: the ability to simulate experiences in everyday life.\n0bqy | Whereas validation studies are still lacking, research has demonstrated that V R-based assessments can perform\nb780 | comparatively to assessments conducted in the real world. Gorini and others examined emotional reactions to food in a virtual kitchen, a real kitchen, and in photographs, among individuals with eating disorders. They found that both real and virtual exposure to food cues elicited the same emotional reactions, which were greater than those elicited by the photographs. V R also enables access to situations and experiences previously difficult to attain in research, such as hard to reach or dangerous environments. For example, V R has been used in neuroimaging research to study brain activation in naturalistic scenarios, a method previously impossible from inside the scanner. Furthermore, since recent developments have resulted in V R becoming completely mobile, assessments do not need to occur within the clinic or lab, allowing people to access them remotely. The possibility to deliver automated assessments in people's homes, independent from a clinician, is an exciting opportunity to increase efficiency, improve accessibility, and reduce cost.\nccmb | Sufficient evidence has accumulated to support the benefits of V R for a variety of assessment purposes in mental health",
