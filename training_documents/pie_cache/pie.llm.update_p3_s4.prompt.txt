You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

bbpr | The presence of all component causes of a causal pie constitutes a sufficient cause, which implies that the out- come occurs. Each of the component causes is then sub- ject to the full force of natural selection on the outcome, for without any one of them, the outcome would not occur (Fig. 2). The force of selection on the outcome is not partitioned over the component causes. Just like the sum of causes exceeds 100 , the force of selection on causes exceeds the force of selection on outcomes. Some component causes will not be determined intrinsically, such as the environment. These component causes will not be subject to natural selection. Still, it will usually be possible to define an intrinsic component cause that is subject to natural selection, such as avoidance of some environmental factor(s).
5zyf | In the absence of any one of its complementary com- ponent causes, the emergence of a component cause has no effect and therefore is not subject to natural selection (barring effects through other sufficient causes). However, component causes are part of the complementary sets of all the other component causes in a causal pie. A compo- nent cause that does not give rise to an outcome immediately does change the set of component causes
9own | against which yet other component causes arise (e.g., new mutations). It thus affects the chance that another com- ponent cause will arise in the context of its complemen- tary set and hence make the outcome occur. In the long term, this gets picked up by evolution. Below, we give a wide-ranging sample of applications of these principles.
bqfb | Example 1: Agents of selection
wwdt | Wade and Kalisz (1990) recognize that "the fitness of an individual is the result of the interaction of the phenotype with the environment and not an intrinsic feature of either one", the phenotype being caused by some gene of interest (Wade and Kalisz 1990, pg. 1949). In this context, they discuss that the selection of a gene that gives a fit- ness (dis)advantage in a particular environment depends on whether that environment is indeed present. They call the environment the "causal agent of selection" of the gene, as the environment causes the gene to be selected.
mn1r | Wade and Kalisz's realization is a special case of the general principle that selection on a component cause depends on the presence or absence of its complementary set. The effect of the component cause "gene" depends on its complementary component cause "environment". The complementary set can certainly be environmental, but can be essentially anything that completes a causal pie. If the interaction of many different genes is necessary to bring about some effect, as in the next example, genes act as each other's complementary component causes.
5vqw | Example 2: Semi-neutral mutations
meyw | Genetic mutations can be semi-neutral: While they do not have an immediate phenotypic effect, they pave the way for non-neutral change over evolutionary time (Wagner 2011). This happens when a number of muta- tions have to be acquired before causing phenotypic change. The order of occurrence and the way in which the mutations are generated may be completely random. Only the last mutation seems non-neutral and causes a change in the phenotype, but it is facilitated by the ear- lier, semi-neutral, mutations. The earlier changes are semi-neutral, because they seem neutral at first sight, but eventually get picked up by evolution.
2e62 | In terms of the causal pie model, new mutations arise in the context of the existing mutations, which determine whether the complementary set is present. The first few mutations are insufficient to have a phenotypic effect, but they do change the context against which new mutations arise. At one point, the new mutation arises in the pres- ence of the other mutations necessary for phenotypic change, that is, its complementary set of a sufficient cause for phenotypic change. All of the mutations are equally
75y3 | causal to the outcome. Yet, all mutations before the one that leads to phenotypic change seem neutral, because their complementary set for phenotypic change is lacking.
s2g2 | Example 3: selection for versus selection of
q1q2 | Selection of refers to an empirical observation of what is selected, while selection for means that there is selection due to a causal effect of some trait on vital rates (Sober 1984; discussed in Endler 1986). These sorts of selection differ if traits are correlated, which is a well-established area of research (Lande 1982; Lande and Arnold 1983; Arnold and Wade 1984; Mitchell-Olds and Shaw 1987). As an example, consider a population of mice in which small mice have a selective advantage, for instance because they are not seen by predators. Suppose also that the same gene that controls body size causes large mice to have blue eyes, while it causes small mice to have green eyes. Finally, suppose that having blue eyes versus green eyes by itself does not affect mortality and fecundity. In this example, there is selection for small body size, because this has a direct effect on the risk of predation. There is selec- tion of not only small body size, but also of green eye color. Although the latter has no effect on fitness, selec- tion results from the correlation of eye color with body size.
cb7r | In the causal pie model, traits are correlated when they share one or more component cause(s). For instance, in Figure 1, A is a component cause for both sufficient causes I and II, leading to correlation. If one sufficient cause is subject to natural selection, the force of selection extends to all component causes. Some of these compo- nent causes can be component causes also of sufficient causes for neutral traits, leading to selection of. In Figure 1, selection on sufficient causes I and II leads to selection on component causes A E. Sufficient cause III is not selected for (it is in itself a neutral trait). Still, there is selection of sufficient cause III, because there exists selection on all its component causes (B, C, E).
