We start with the partition function. The energy of a free particle of mass m is p dot p divided by two m, so the partition function is the integral of exp negative p dot p divided by two m over all possible positions and momenta. Integrate over momentum and you get\nucxa | exp negative B open parenthesis p one square plus p two square plus p three square close parenthesis divided by two m differential p one differential p two differential p three divide h cubed equals h divided by two m m beta to the power of three\ndpzv | In terms of the thermal wavelength this is just one divide A cubed. Integrate over position and you multiply this by the volume of the box, say V. So we get an incredibly simple final answer:\np3zg | Z equals V divide A cubed\ndcq6 | And this sort of calculation works in any dimension: there's nothing special about the number three here.\n4onb | PARTICLE IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL BOX: ENTROPY\nj6i2 | In thermal equilibrium, a classical free particle of mass m in a threed box of volume V has expected energy\nsu8b | E equals kT divided by two times three\nap79 | and free energy\no2lj | A cubed V\n9ksk | F equals negative kT Ln\n3rje | where A equals h divided by V to the power of two times m kT is the thermal wavelength. But entropy S is E minus F divided by T, so\n1ib3 | S equals k ln V divided by A cubed plus three\nlokq | The entropy of a particle in thermal equilibrium in a three-dimensional box works very much like our earlier calculation for a one-dimensional box, with a couple of adjustments due to the dimension. Since the particle's energy is now a quadratic function of three variables, the equipartition theorem now says its expected energy is\ni9g3 | E equals kT.\naprs | We can work out its free energy from its partition function, which we computed in the last tweet:\nnna4 | V\n83b6 | F equals negative kT ln Z equals negative k ln\nph9z | V divided by A cubed.\nmuji | Thus its entropy is\nglmb | S equals E minus F divided by T\nsaqe | The meaning of the two terms here is very similar to that for the particle in the one-dimensional box. The first term is k times the logarithm of the number of accessible states, as always for the Gibbs entropy of a system in thermal equilibrium. Here the number of accessible states is V divide A cubed. The second term is two k thanks to the equipartition theorem, since the particle's expected energy depends quadratically on three degrees of freedom. When V is much greater than A cubed this second term is a small correction to the first. As this ceases to be true, the second term becomes more important and when A cubed is comparable to V, quantum corrections to our calculation also become significant.\ne6o9 | A TALE OF TWO GASES\nwgep | The entropy of an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a box of volume V is\n71hf | S equals kN open parenthesis ln V plus three halves ln kT plus three halves ln k plus ln I m plus three halves close parenthesis.\nefpl | \n01ri | while for indistinguishable particles it's\n1lfn | S equals kN ln open parenthesis V divide N close parenthesis plus three halves ln kT plus three halves ln m plus three halves.\n3lvh | \n6ub3 | \nn712 | where the corrections are small compared to N as N gets larger.\nlxns | Now we are finally ready to tackle the entropy of a gas. We start with a monatomic ideal gas, which means N free point particles bouncing around in a box. But there's a subtlety! We'll get different answers depending on whether we think of these particles as distinguishable or indistinguishable. That is: do we count the state of the gas as different if we switch two particles, or not?\n4afc | The formulas look very similar. There are three differences:\npx1t | For distinguishable particles, we'll get an exact formula, while for indistinguishable particles, we'll get an approximate one, where the corrections are small compared to N when N becomes large.\nehz9 | The entropy for distinguishable particles has a term equal to two kN, while for indistinguishable particles it has a term equal to zero.\nqrj5 | Most importantly, there's a huge difference in the volume dependence! Where the distinguishable particles have a term in the entropy equal to kN ln V, the indistinguishable ones have a term equal to kN ln open parenthesis V divide N close parenthesis, so their entropy is considerably smaller for large volumes.\nmwd5 | The last difference makes the entropy behave strangely for distinguishable particles, so in practice the physically important case is the gas of indistinguishable particles. But we'll do the calculations in both cases, because the distinguishable case is easier, and interesting.\ngng6 | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: PARTITION FUNCTION\nfjnz | The partition function of an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a three-dimensional box B of volume V is\n15hc | Z equals integral over B to the power of N exponential negative B times sum from i equals one to N pi dot pi divide two m differential three p one dot dot dot differential three p N differential three q one dot dot dot differential three q N\nmkzd | equals pi squared times pi h to the power of three hundred N\nuhjq | equals two pi m beta to the power of three N divide by two\n6sbj | equals V to the power of N divide h to the power of three N\nd8m4 | Thus Z equals A to the power of three N divide V to the power of N\nx6o5 | where A equals h open parenthesis eight divide two pi m close parenthesis to the power of one half is the thermal wavelength.\niw9a | Suppose we have a system of N distinguishable classical free particles in a three-dimensional box B of volume V. The state of this system is described by N positions q one, dot dot dot, q N in B and N momenta p one, dot dot dot, p N in R three. If each particle has mass m, the energy of the i th particle is equal to\ndni7 | E i equals pi dot pi divide two m\nuhfc | and the energy of the system is\nx4b2 | E equals sum from i equals one to N E i. Let's call the partition function of this system Z. To compute this, we integrate exp negative B E over the space of states, obtaining\npbg2 | Z equals integral V to the power of N integral R to the power of three N exponential negative B E differential three p one dot dot dot differential three p N differential three q one dot dot dot differential three q N divide h to the power of three N.\n0oy0 | Above, I proceeded to compute Z directly by doing the Gaussian integral over momenta and integrating each position over the box. Here's a slightly different way. Because\nlr84 | exp negative open parenthesis E close parenthesis equals exp negative B E one dot dot dot exp negative B E N,\n0vq1 | the partition function Z is a product of integrals which are all equal:\ngkya | B integral R cubed exponential negative B p dot p divide two m differential three p differential three q divide h cubed.\nc2iz | Z equals\nya41 | The integral in the parentheses is the partition function of a single particle in a box. We have already seen that this equals\naa56 | B integral R cubed exponential negative B p dot p divide two m differential three p differential three q equals V divide h cubed\nqfgp | A cubed\nyu1c | where A is the thermal wavelength. Thus we have\n1j33 | Z equals\nk3a8 | We can also do this calculation with a lot less work using Puzzle thirty-six. This implies that when we build a new system from N identical noninteracting copies of some old system, the partition function of the new system is the N th power of the partition function of the old system. What I just did is show this in a special case.\n2s31 | GAS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: ENTROPY\notwe | In thermal equilibrium, an ideal gas of N distinguishable classical particles of mass m in a three-dimensional box of volume V has expected energy\n4cb7 | E equals kNT divide by two times three\n9wka | and free energy\n9gxs | A to the power of three N divide by V to the power of N\ne8ks | F equals negative kT ln\n072r | where A equals h divide V to the power of two m kT is the thermal wavelength.
