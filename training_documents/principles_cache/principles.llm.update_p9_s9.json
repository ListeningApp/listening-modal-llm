The research from each of these three sources has implications for classroom instruction, and these implications are described in each of these ten principles.\n320g | Even though these principles come from three different sources, the instructional procedures that are taken from one source do not conflict with the instructional procedures that are taken from another source. Instead, the ideas from each of the sources overlap and add to each other. This overlap gives us faith that we are developing a valid and research-based understanding of the art of teaching.\ntp8g | Endnotes",
