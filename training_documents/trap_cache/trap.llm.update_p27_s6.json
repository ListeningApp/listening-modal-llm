True, inequality increased dramatically, raising debates about possible \"Latin Americanization.\" Yet on other dimensions, China shows that it is already advancing out of middle income status with lower informality, a shadow economy of twelve percent, extremely high investment of forty-nine percent, low foreign direct investment of ten percent, high research and development spending.\nrsbu | Two percent, not far below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average, and educational institutions producing large numbers of engineers and technicians, including twenty-one percent of secondary students enrolled in technical education. This potential for moving quickly through middle income status reflects China's resemblance to earlier Asian developmental states by virtue of a clear connection for political elites between development and the capacity to address geopolitical challenges, a connection missing in other middle income countries, and by virtue of the stability of its authoritarian regime.\nmagd | In sum, these comparisons across a wide range of periods and contexts help illuminate cases where politics were more conducive to building and sustaining upgrading coalitions due to factors ranging from elite cohesion around things like European Union accession, to more bottom-up pressures (as in Malay party dominance), to state-assisted upgrading in some successful sectors. These positive cases raise hopes that it is not impossible to escape the middle income trap, but at the same time they highlight a range of rare facilitating factors that are as yet not common in most middle income countries.\ntb74 | Six. Conclusions and Implications\n8l69 | Many contemporary middle income countries find themselves on a path-dependent trajectory where the very factors that contributed to and or accompanied their movement into middle-income status (such as informality, high foreign direct investment stocks, inequality, and low levels of human capital) both reinforce each other and constitute obstacles to progressing out of middle income. By fragmenting business and labor, they undercut the potential demand for upgrading institutions. These conditions contrast with earlier high income graduates that, when transitioning to high income, did not face the combined, divisive cleavages of high and persistent inequality, informality, and reliance on foreign direct investment.\n1jyv | This article focuses on the primary domestic cleavages among social groups that impede the coalition building required for institutional upgrading. A fuller analysis of the middle income trap would also need to incorporate further analysis of state capacity and related pathologies of corruption and clientelism. For example, taxation is one core area of state capacity where middle income states lag in terms of their ability to collect revenue, overall and especially in income taxes—a weakness commonly associated with large informal sectors. Institution building of the sort analyzed here.\nolce | is costly and is likely to rely heavily on public funding, so tax capacity becomes a critical component. Coalition building is decisive in our view, and bureaucratic resistance and fragmentation can pose additional obstacles to effective policy and institution building. It is important, for example, to understand why education bureaucracies are often large, politicized sources of rents at the primary and secondary levels and fragmented at the tertiary level, while state-sponsored postsecondary vocational and technical education is fragmented and weakly related to business needs.\nerx1 | Our analysis of foreign direct investment and the shifting development requirements of the twenty-first century indirectly incorporates some international factors. A fuller analysis would also need to examine in greater depth a range of issues, from micro-level dynamics in global production networks to shifting international trade regimes, to the overall opportunities for expanding high value-added exports. However, the international factors that were crucial in earlier industrializers—especially geostrategic threats and economic integration—are less relevant for large middle income countries. The Cold War is over and the countries of Latin America and Southeast Asia, as well as South Africa and Turkey, face no imminent existential threat. Nor are recent trends in economic integration likely to help forge domestic upgrading coalitions. If European Union accession returns to the agenda in Turkey, it could have this enabling effect. By contrast, Mexican integration through North American Free Trade Agreement did bring elites together, but it was around a common set of neoliberal policies rather than around institution building for upgrading. In Asia, regional integration through Association of Southeast Asian Nations was more politically driven, with little engagement by business, especially domestic business.\nb3bt | Understanding this path-dependent dynamic is all the more important in light of some important shifts in the global economy that did not confront earlier successful industrializers. Following Alexander Gerschenkron, the advance of technology and the prior industrialization of other countries change the challenges and opportunities for the next graduates to high income. So, while twentieth-century industrializers could rely on relatively autarchic growth, Fordist mass production, and integrated industrial sectors, today's would-be graduates to high income face a much more open global economy characterized by rapid product cycles, intensely competitive markets, global production networks, and dominant service sectors. Therefore, the specific economic trajectories to high income will be different in the twenty\n0w8m | first century, but they will still require strong institutions and enduring support coalitions to create and sustain them.\nvcu3 | Our analysis of the middle income stall has several practical and theoretical implications. First, on the practical side, it is necessary to recognize that the policy recommendations typically proposed are difficult to implement and require institutions with significant capacity to mobilize resources and coordinate diverse interests. This phase of institutional development is not just about getting the rules right and providing broad incentives to attract capital and labor into new sectors; more important, it is also about building effective organizations like schools and research centers, as well as various forums where different economic agents can cultivate long-term collaborations. The neoliberal Washington consensus of the nineteen nineties revolved primarily around a set of policies. The new, more pragmatic consensus of the two thousands emphasizes, by contrast, institutions in industrial policy, human capital, and governance generally. This represents progress, but the next step is to reach a better understanding of what it takes to build institutions.\nhjzj | Thus, a further implication of our analysis bears on institutional origins. Economists are correct that building such institutions is best understood as a contractarian process allowing interdependent actors to reap gains from trade. But on its own, this formulation is incomplete, as it fails to acknowledge that strong institutions typically emerge through the incremental interactions of a small number of large, mutually vulnerable actors. These are precisely the conditions undermined by the structural factors or societal disarticulation so common in today's middle income countries. Indeed, although accounts of coalitional bases of prior movement into high income do acknowledge differences within and among business and labor, the kinds of foreign-local and formal-informal splits within business and labor respectively are striking in their absence from these accounts.\nj79f | At a broader theoretical level, our analysis adopts a more structural perspective—one that is focused on the long-term evolution of social and economic groups—than the widespread institutional consensus in development studies. Much recent debate has revolved around which institutions are the most important, often pitting liberal arguments (property rights and the rule of law) against statist alternatives (industrial policy and effective bureaucracies). But much of this debate is premature and misplaced. We must first achieve a better understanding of the coalitional foundations needed to create and sustain these insti-\n6tbv | tutions, as well as of the structural factors that shape the potential for coalition building.\nxb13 | Middle Income Trap\ncxqi | Middle Income Trap\n```",
