        "content": "fcco | Our core contention is that strong upgrading coalitions have not emerged in today's MI countries. Owing to the ways these countries grew into MI status-by their reliance on various combinations of cheap labor, foreign investment, and commodity exports-the economic elites and workers in MI countries have different compositions, cleavages, and underlying interests than did those in the earlier industrializers. Indeed, we are aware of no existing scholarship on these countries arguing that such upgrading coalitions exist. We can only speculate about what such an upgrading coalition might look like in the future. The past experience of rich countries suggests that it might be cross-class among business and workers, as in Northern Europe, or more elitist and more exclusively among economic elites, as in East Asia. Our goal, though, is\n8uji | not to recommend particular coalitions, but rather to examine the fissures that make any potential upgrading coalition less likely.\ndf3e | The fragmentation of social groups is both vertical (high inequality) and horizontal (within business and labor). Of course, business and labor are differentiated everywhere by size and sectoral, geographical, and other divisions. But fragmentation in MI countries is both deeper than in most other cases, and now more consequential. The fragmentation means that firms and workers in different parts of the economy have different strategies and therefore different interests regarding key upgrading reforms (and a range of other policies as well), especially education, as will be discussed in Section IV.\n53eu | INEQUALITY\na5u1 | Inequality has risen higher and endured longer in today's MI countries than in earlier industrializers. In Figure three (note the inverted scale on the Y-axis), the line slopes upward and shows that the large MI countries are more unequal than would have been predicted from their income. Viewed historically, many MI countries have passed the levels of GDP per capita that OECD countries had earlier in the twentieth century, when their inequality was falling. Over the course of the twentieth century, for pretax Gini coefficients in ten OECD countries, inequality fell steadily from point four eight in nineteen ten to point three five in nineteen eighty (and then rose to point three nine in two thousand). By contrast, Gini coefficients for five MI countries rose to above point five in nineteen thirty and stayed at this very high level until two thousand. After two thousand inequality fell in most of the nine large MI countries, though only slightly on average, from point five to point four eight.\nry7u | Most scholars would agree that inequality makes politics more discordant and fractious, thus discouraging the centripetal and consensual politics that Foxley and Sossdorf and others urge on MI countries. Beyond general contention, inequality also makes MI politics vulnerable to several kinds of political dysfunction, including elite capture, economic entrenchment, clientelism, and populism, all of which in various ways divert political attention and economic resources away from upgrading and work against the formation of upgrading coalitions.\n5mda | Most simply, two-actor models of highly unequal societies start with the premise that these political economies have distinct dynamics\ni4li | because elites enjoy greater power and nonelites have less recourse for checking that power. In economic versions of such models, elites create extractive institutions to ensure their rents, even if these institutions slow growth for the economy as a whole. Although oversimplified, these models are useful in highlighting the pivotal role of domestic elite participation in potential upgrading coalitions and the ways in which elite privileges can discourage such engagement.\nr8sm | One obstacle to such participation involves a form of entrenchment in which longer periods in MI status allow large firms and elite social groups to consolidate their positions in the economy and the polity. The domestic firms-mostly huge, conglomerated, family-owned business groups-that grew large in the late twentieth century were concentrated in commodities (natural resources, basic metals, and other semiprocessed goods), regulated sectors (especially banking and utilities), natural oligopolies (such as cement and beer), and occasionally, low-tech manufacturing (having been boxed out of high-tech manufacturing by MNCs). They were already very large and powerful coming into the twenty-first century. In contrast to business groups in countries that escaped the MI trap, these concentrated business groups have had little to gain from pushing for policies that would help their economies break out of the trap. They are entrenched in their own traditional business strategies and in politics and wield power to maintain institutions favorable to their existing businesses.",
