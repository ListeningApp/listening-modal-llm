You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

4mdw | Summary
49f1 | In this chapter, you learned one of the most critical concepts of using Tableau Public and producing accurate, informative data visualizations- connecting to, transforming, and loading data. The precepts that we discussed, such as making sure that your data source is clean and formatted properly, are relevant to working with data.
csae | In the next chapter, we will discuss the different types of visualizations that you can make with your data and how to use each type correctly and in the most compelling manner.
c29v | 4 Visualization - Tips and Types
gkgm | A journalist or blogger who uses Tableau Public must convert data to visualizations so that readers can quickly understand large quantities of data that have been distilled down to a single graphic. The role of an author is data abstraction, the conversion of real-life data into visual cues (primitives, as some people who work in the field of data science call them), such as colors, shapes, lengths, and positions. The role of your reader is to do the reverse, consume data primitives and convert them back into real-life things, events, and phenomenon. If you have done a poor job choosing the elements of your data visualization, your readers will have a difficult time relating your visualization to the real world, which means that the story that you're telling isn't as compelling as it should be. Your visualization will not have the value that you wanted, because the connection between the data visualization and the underlying data has been broken.
swmm | Before you create a visualization for people to utilize, there are several considerations that go into the design. The following are some of these considerations:
dak5 | . The purpose of the visualization: Which questions should it answer?
57sj | · Content: What should be included? (Start small, as less is often more).
qdqk | · The visualization structure: What do you actually want to measure or show?
emd4 | . The readers' platform: How have your readers approached your questions before? Which tools have they used to do so?
m9fu | In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
b3ph | · The lifecycle of visualization
9j3h | · Iterative design and what it means
q1lo | · Creating visualizations and visual perceptions
biqi | Visualization - Tips and Types

j83k | · Using discrete and continuous dates and measures
nle2 | · Filtering, grouping, and sorting
19po | An overview of the development lifecycle
sx65 | Perform the following steps to develop a high-quality, compelling visualization:
ilzn | . The first step is to devise a purpose for the visualization - a question that you would like the data to answer - and envision the possible visualization types that can best answer that question.
uzp0 | . Next, define the content and find your relevant data; determine how much data should be shown and the level of details required. A large part of your visualization project should be spent on finding and cleansing data. Do not skimp on this step, because it will make your visualization more clear and useful to readers. You may have to scrape data from the Internet or combine it from multiple sources.
yq4x | . Wherever you get your data, make sure that you have both validated and attributed it properly.
i901 | We surveyed a few experts in Tableau Public, and anecdotally, they estimate that they spend 70% to 80% of their total development time building data sources.
n98j | . The third step (with respect to this book) is to try various view chart types using the Show Me feature of Tableau Public. Try various view types to answer the question, experiment with various views, add or subtract data, manipulate components, and explore the question in greater detail or find other questions.
xgyu | . The next step in building a visualization is considering the platform- print, desktop, laptop, tablet, and smartphone. The medium that your consumers use to interact with your visualizations and develop insights is critical.
ue40 | · The last step is publishing your work, or delivering content to your visualization consumers. Your data visualization should start a conversation. So expect feedback.

3z1s | Ten visualization tips
une6 | Data visualization is an art and a science. Much has been researched, studied, and published on the topic of what a great visualization is composed of. In this section, let's attempt to clarify some of these findings via some brief explanations, as shown in following list. As with everything in life, your mileage may vary, and there are always exceptions to rules. However, consider these general rules as condensed, combined, and paraphrased here as compared to the industry standards and academic research as you develop visualizations:
eroy | · Readers should be able to understand data visualization quickly. Make it easy for your consumer to read your data visualization. Don't use font sizes that are less than 10 pt if you can manage it, and use common fonts that are designed for ease of use. The key is that visualizations are not too flashy, complex, or artistic just for the sake of it. Do not use 3D in any way, it distracts and can mislead readers by distorting data. Follow the form over function principle, and the amount of time required to understand the data will work itself out.
b09g | · Consider the format for the reader. Print, computer screens, and mobile devices use large fonts for titles, and consider the format of consumers' devices. Scrolling is not good in most cases, and you should manage white space carefully.
psuf | · Every element should have a reason for being in a virtualization. Choose colors carefully. Use colors for categories instead of quantities; don't use colors randomly. Shapes, colors, legends, and labels should add to the understanding of the visualization.
ojfh | . Be consistent in the placement of objects, elements, and colors. Your work is your digital brand, it literally is your product. Your consumers may not know you in person. Their perception of you and your skills is determined by how they relate to your visualizations. Do not use variety for variety's sake. The organization of elements and colors is important, as it helps readers navigate through the visualization.
qri0 | . Use the correct context for data and consistent axes for elements on a chart. Help readers understand the data and what they are looking at. Do not mislead readers by using mismatched axes for charts that compare the same measure, nonzero axes, and other misleading tactics.
hbbb | . Simplicity comes from clarity, and this helps readers understand data. Keep it simple! Some data sets are inherently complex. In such cases, try to show a part of the data set, or break up the visualizations to show the various aspects of the data. Be clear in your organization and approach, and simplicity (for readers) will follow.
uy56 | Visualization - Tips and Types
sy3k | • Consider calculating differences for readers instead of plotting multiple lines or bars in an effort to show the comparisons and differences. For example, a line chart of the city budget versus the city expenditures may be interesting, but an even better option is to use a bar chart, with a baseline set to the budget and bars above or under the baseline. Alternatively, you can set reference lines in a chart by using mean or target values.
ido2 | . Choose the best type of view (chart) for the data. Read the following sections and understand the key elements of every major chart type and what the main objectives of each chart type are.
uq3f | · Understand the different visualization primitives (color, length, area, shapes, position, direction, and angle) and how humans perceive them in terms of data visualization.
c006 | . Experiment with the Tableau Public Show Me feature to choose a view type and make changes of your own, such as selecting the shelf items that you need to include, and their characteristics. Experiment and refine, and think in terms of a visualization cycle of exploration rather than a linear route from data to visualization creation.
yatc | The perception of visual clues
ny4k | Our brains interpret visual signals in specific, predictable ways, and modern user interfaces and consumer products are based on extensive study in this area. The way we interact with visual signals was first formally studied and discussed by William Cleveland and Robert McGill (at the time, with AT&T Laboratories) in their seminal paper named Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods, as published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association in September 1984. This paper is readily available via a quick Internet search, and it is worth a quick read.
