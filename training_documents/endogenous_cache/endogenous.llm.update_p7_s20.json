        "content": "zuhq | Two hundred sixty-five and have been demonstrated to resemble the endogenous ApoE lipoproteins observed in the\npt13 | Two hundred sixty-six brain. DIVthirteen primary neurons from twenty-S-FLAG transgenic mice were incubated with\nrw3z | Two hundred sixty-seven unconjugated or PC-conjugated ApoE for twenty-four hours and then subjected to surface biotinylation.\nvoc3 | Two hundred sixty-eight We find that PC-ApoE, and not the unconjugated versions, modify neuroproteasome surface\nhuha | Two hundred sixty-nine localization with the rank order PC-ApoEfour less than Vehicle, PC-ApoEthree less than PC-ApoEtwo. We find\notjb | Two hundred seventy no change in other membrane proteins such as GluNone, which has previously been shown not to\n1rbe | Twenty-seven change in an ApoE isoform-dependent manner. The lipoprotein-dependent effect on\nz978 | Two hundred seventy-two neuroproteasome localization requires ApoE, as the addition of just the liposomes without ApoE\nqxdv | Two hundred seventy-four\n06co | Two hundred seventy-five\njei2 | Two hundred seventy-six\ntti3 | Two hundred seventy-seven FLAG-neuroproteasomes are a useful tool to measure the surface localization of\nr4pa | Two hundred seventy-eight neuroproteasomes and we next took advantage of the epitope tag to test whether ApoE isoforms\nivgr | Two hundred seventy-nine modified the subcellular distribution and localization of neuroproteasomes in intact neurons. We\nvobc | Two hundred eighty used antibody feeding onto live neuronal cultures from the twenty-S-FLAG mice transduced with\n3rdh | Two hundred eighty-one AAVs to express Cre. No staining was observed using secondary alone controls or when feeding an antibody against intracellular protein MAPtwo. After live cell\nlbvs | Two hundred eighty-two anti-FLAG antibody feeding, neurons were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for total\n3ld6 | Two hundred eighty-four intracellular MAPtwo to label dendrites. Consistent with this approach being a robust measure of\n1ac5 | Two hundred eighty-five neuroproteasome localization, we observed punctal neuroproteasome localization\noau9 | Two hundred eighty-seven signal. We observe significant overlap of surface FLAG signal with MAPtwo-positive protrusions that resemble dendritic spines. We observe that PC-ApoEtwo increases neuroproteasome surface localization by nearly twofold and that PC-ApoEfour reduces neuroproteasome surface\n9i0g | Two hundred eighty-eight \n3w3y | Two hundred eighty-nine \n3ejg | Two hundred ninety localization by nearly threefold compared to PC vehicle or PC-ApoEthree controls. In total,\nehdq | Two hundred ninety-one these data recapitulate the observations from the hApoE-KI mice and support our hypothesis that extracellular ApoE isoforms can influence neuroproteasome localization and function.\nmahz | Two hundred ninety-two\nba46 | Two hundred ninety-three\nbjmu | Two hundred ninety-four Neuroproteasome localization is reduced in vulnerable brain regions in the human brain and is further reduced by ApoEfour genotype.\nw8jo | Two hundred ninety-five\nn4g6 | Two hundred ninety-six\nxrzh | Two hundred ninety-seven We next tested whether ApoE-dependent mislocalization of neuroproteasomes is observable in\nb5m5 | Two hundred ninety-nine from the Massachusetts General Hospital Brain Bank. The ApoEthree/three\nwu5k | Three hundred subgroup was subdivided into five negative diagnoses and nine positive diagnoses for Alzheimer's Disease. Sex was\nn462 | Three hundred one evenly distributed in samples except for the ApoEfour cases which were all male. This design\n7tg4 | Three hundred two allows us to compare the effect of Alzheimer's Disease on neuroproteasome localization as well as the effect of\n5kya | Three hundred three ApoE genotype on neuroproteasome localization. We obtained material from the Brodmann Area\n7muy | Three hundred five tissue from Brodmann Area seven\n3zl7 | Three hundred four\ni0sj | Three hundred six\nslsh | Three hundred seven contained severe tangle and amyloid pathology as well as neuronal loss whereas tissue from Brodmann Area four\nji5o | Three hundred eight had moderate amyloid pathology but not tangle accumulation or neuronal loss. For simplicity,\n4nlx | Three hundred nine we will refer to Brodmann Area seven as tissue with severe pathology and Brodmann Area four as tissue with mild pathology. We\no3xz | Three hundred ten fractionated these samples to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and cytosol, enriching for plasma\n84mq | Three hundred twelve membranes and detergent-insoluble proteins. We monitored the success of our fractionation\n56tt | Three hundred eleven\nchel | using LLVY-based proteasome activity assays out of the supernatant of our washes and\nasam | Three hundred thirteen continued washing our plasma membrane preparations until cytosolic proteasomes were undetectable.\ndixj | Three hundred fourteen\na3t5 | Three hundred fifteen\njlbs | Three hundred sixteen We then subjected plasma membrane/aggregate fractions to quantitative TMT proteomics\n6aui | Three hundred seventeen analysis. TMT proteomics enables unbiased quantification of the proteome and the ability to\ny7r5 | Three hundred eighteen make quantitative comparison across samples. We compensated for brain region and individual\nnhpx | Three hundred nineteen variability in two ways: by first normalizing protein loading into the mass spectrometer and then\n2yc2 | Three hundred twenty normalizing the collected data against the total TMT signal per patient sample. This total TMT\neehg | Three hundred twenty-one signal normalization provides the highest confidence metric for protein abundance normalization\nght4 | Three hundred twenty-two across all samples. Given the number of samples, we combined three TMTpro sixteen-plex\nsx29 | Three hundred twenty-three experiments with a shared internal standard which enabled quantitation across TMT experiments.\nj7hg | Three hundred twenty-four We first performed a series of quality control checks to ensure that these data provided reliable\n2c66 | Three hundred twenty-five and reproducible measures. First, these data validate our plasma membrane enrichment protocol\nzzrc | Three hundred twenty-seven\nm1vl | Three hundred twenty-eight\nghtz | Three hundred twenty-nine AnxAone, Gpnmb, and Tau in Alzheimer's Disease brains compared to unaffected controls.\n72zw | Three hundred thirty we also find a significant decrease in Vgf and SlcthirtyAthree consistent with\n9v2o | Three hundred thirty-four\nfn2s | Three hundred thirty-five After validating our approach, we next analyzed the effect of Alzheimer's Disease on neuroproteasome\nrhn0 | Three hundred thirty-six localization, measured by the relative quantity of twenty-S proteasome subunits in our quantitative\npg87 | Three hundred thirty-seven mass spectrometry dataset. First, in comparing Alzheimer's Disease samples to cognitively normal controls, we\n4r9c | Three hundred thirty-eight find a striking reduction in nearly every twenty-S proteasome subunit in the plasma membrane\nxbmu | Three hundred thirty-nine fraction from Brodmann Area seven tissue. We next sought to determine whether ApoE\nrp75 | Three hundred forty genotype influenced neuroproteasome localization in human tissue. Given the significant effect\n62hx | Three hundred forty-one of Alzheimer's Disease on neuroproteasome localization, we constrained the analysis only to the effect of ApoE\nn5mv | Three hundred forty-three ApoE4/4 Alzheimer's Disease cohort against the\n3lem | Three hundred forty-four membrane fraction in the ApoE4 genotype compared to ApoEthree genotype in the Brodmann Area seven vulnerable\njm94 | Three hundred forty-six\nv4s7 | Three hundred forty-seven To validate our proteomics data, we monitored surface localization of neuroproteasomes by\nj6ud | Three hundred forty-eight immunoblot analysis. We controlled for sample loading by normalizing against Kvone point two, a protein\nrlh2 | Three hundred forty-nine whose expression has been reproducibly demonstrated as unchanged in the Alzheimer's Disease brain.\ngwtt | Three hundred fifty While this strategy is required for loading controls by immunoblot, these loading controls line up\ngzru | Three hundred fifty-one with the normalization strategy for mass spectrometry based on the total amount of TMT signal",
