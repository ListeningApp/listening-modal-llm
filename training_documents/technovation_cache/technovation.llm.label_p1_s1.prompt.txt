You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

06yq | Book review
dpv6 | Recent years have seen several edited book collections on the creative, or cultural industries. Many of these feel obliged to justify the use of the terms and categories in rather apologetic and defensive ways. This is partly because there is an implied elitism, particularly in the "creative industries" term that some are uncomfortable with-as with the often-heard "Aren't all indus- tries creative?". There is resistance to the pixie dust of creativity being associated only with the young, brash, designer glasses- wearing, cappuccino-sippers of sectors like advertising, new media and design. "There is creativity in manufacturing plastic refuse sacks." Some would say. Having done research on all these sectors I can say that yes, there is creativity in bin-bag production, but it is of a different type to that shared by the aforementioned creative industries. There are similarities in process, in relation to innovation, and in relation to the value experienced by consumers in the products of these sectors.
8r5j | A second dimension to the creative industries category is the political-policy aspect. Governments of the advanced industria- lised countries have promoted creative industries as essentially forward-looking, high-growth sectors that are desirable, contem- porary and cool. The suspicion here is of an unseemly alliance between politicians and parties trying to win votes among the young, and industries lobbying for special policy attention. There is also a concern about complacency, in that the emerging economies are fast catching up in many creative industries just as they have in manufacturing, as noted in the Cox Review (HMSO, 2005).
2taz | These types of issues infuse the collection edited by Andy Pratt and Paul Jeffcutt on Creativity, Innovation and the Cultural Economy. It is a thoughtfully designed collection, with six sector-clusters covered by two chapters each: advertising, music, film and television, new media, design, and museums/visual arts/ performance. The sectors were chosen to give a variety across the commercial/non-commercial continuum, but the general argu- ment is that the creative industries are a diverse set of sectors and heavily conditioned by their individual contexts. Having pairs of chapters on each sector-cluster acknowledges variety of methods and approaches.
o3ya | Pratt and Jeffcutt top and tail the collection with introduction and concluding chapters. The approach they take is that creativity and innovation ought not to be thought of as inputs and outputs, but rather "effects" of the contexts that the creative industries reside in. The geography orientation runs deep in this collec- tion-the editors and authors are interested in the places where
r5il | doi: 10.1016/j.technovation.2009.09.005
5gui | technovation
82qc | creative industry activity occurs, including the institutions, net- works, project-based ecologies that form "the cloud" in which creative professionals do their work.
ls7d | While stressing the differences within the creative industries Pratt and Jeffcutt also find some similarities that contradict popular distinctions-for example that the increasing commercial imperatives being applied to the museums and galleries sector show similar tensions with a "culture as public resource" view in the film industry. This creative arts-commerce tension is found in the other sectors too.
tzt3 | The guiding brief that the editors have given their contributors is to discuss the meanings and occurrences of creativity and innovation in their studied sectors. Some stick to the brief more than others; Mark Lorenzen's chapter on the film industry is a concise discussion that stresses the differentiation required in successful films, yet also the industry dynamics that militate against this differentiation, such as the growing reliance on stars and sequels to help offset the great risks of film-making.
t8vv | Showing the geography bent, Lorenzen refers to film clusters, more than other units of analysis like countries or firms. This resonates with the following chapter on the London film region by Pratt and Gornostaeva. They point out that although Soho is still considered the heart of the UK's film industry, all the actual filming happens in the suburbs of London. The same is true of Hollywood, in that film-shooting generally occurs elsewhere in Los Angeles. Partly this is due to the increased mobility allowed by digital technologies in cameras and equipment. Nevertheless Pratt and Gornostaeva assess the impact of digital technologies on the film industry as rather less important than factors such as regulation and public policies to stimulate the independent sector. Technology has had a more profound impact on television by contrast, not least because of the proliferation of channels. This proliferation reflects a shift away from centralised organisational forms to networks and spatial interaction.
qvnu | Regulation and lobbying power also trump technology in David Hesmondhalgh's chapter on the recorded music sector. Here, it is argued, transformations due to digitisation have led to the extension of copyright laws. This was in response to the presentations of digital technology as hostile to the creativity of the industry, by the industry. Hesmondhalgh is sceptical about the disintermediation promised by digital enthusiasts and predicts that the relations between rights holders, artists and consumers are unlikely to change dramatically.
kggw | The chapters on design consider the cities of Montreal (Leslie and Rantisi) and Stockholm (Power) and raise the importance of events, such as fairs, trade shows, Design Days and Weeks-these support the networking necessary to sustain the buzz and business. Power points out that contrary to some romantic regional theories this networking is not so much about sharing knowledge so much as finding your next job or project. This alludes to the fragility of the creative industries business, in spite

5746 | of their high growth, they tend to be "winner take all" in outcomes, as the editors argue. This inequality is not only horizontal but also in the value chain-it is not always the creatives who have the industry. Location also plays a part in the value chain, meaning that locations at the periphery of corporate capital are always threatened by takeover or closure, as indicated by Hutton's chapter on new media in Vancouver. This effects a kind of "branch plant" status on peripheral firms, in spite of their creative edge.
7toz | The location of creativity within the organisation is the theme of Chris Bilton's chapter on advertising. Bilton argues that creativity is no longer only offered by the creatives, but throughout the functions of the modern agency, as a result of the ascendancy of media planning. The "creatives" silo has been downgraded in effect, since key creative decisions are taken by the planners with the client in relation to overall strategy and brand, rather than individual creative artefacts like ads. Again this also appears to be a tenuous source of competitive advantage, as media planning relationships may be severed abruptly even if (especially if?) they have been successful.
j346 | The implicit theme of fragility and the shifting locus of creativity are raised again in Sean Nixon's chapter on boozy creatives working in advertising in Soho, whom originally come from the provinces. In some ways these contextual place studies of social networks raise more questions that they answer. Many UK industries have a drinking culture, in and out of the creative industries-how much then is it a UK phenomenon, rather than an advertising one? Some creatives who do not drink greatly resent the alcohol culture in Soho Adland and feel excluded from the network. Do they contribute any less, or more than the boozers? Is this true of ad clusters in New York and other countries? However these sector chapters are not research case studies explaining methods and analysis and cause and effect, but are better read as impressions, filled with informative anecdotes and insights by knowledgeable researchers.
v8uq | Other questions that come to mind are about the opportunities for entrepreneurs and start-ups, in these exclusive networks of reputation? And with the focus on the UK and North America-a limitation acknowledged by the editors, which is understandable given that the book grew from a UK ESRC-funded seminar series-what about the emerging economies in an increasingly global economy?
x972 | Fortunately, these kinds of questions are tackled in another collection: Entrepreneurship in the Creative Industries, edited by Colette Henry. There is less agonising here over definitions, the editors and most of the chapters simply accept the UK's Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which defined the creative industries as the following 13 sectors in its 1998 mapping exercise: advertising, architecture, art and antiques, computer games, crafts, design, designer fashion, film and video, music, performing arts, publishing, software and television and radio (DCMS, 1998). This remains a popular categorisation, albeit associated with the New Labour government of Tony Blair. Chapter four of this book, by David Rae discusses the influence of this period in a UK perspective, pointing out some of the problematic effects of identifying the creative economy as different and non-mainstream. For example, Rae refers to the relatively poor standing of the UK in R&D expenditure and some other indicators of innovation, which stand in contrast to the high energy of the creative sectors in recent years, and calls for "cultural diffusion" to occur. This argument resonates with recent work by NESTA and the Queensland school on spillovers from the creative industries to the rest of the economy.
cwrw | The "special" nature of creative people is discussed in the chapter by O Cinneide and Henry, which argues that creative people have many qualities associated with entrepreneurship,

h2l3 | such as risk-taking, tolerance for ambiguity, perseverance and autonomy. The chapter raises the case of Irish music and dance, such as Riverdance, which was launched from Eurovision Song Contest success to a new genre of live and recorded entertainment. However, the chapter stresses the barriers to entrepreneurship and the fact that even with the Irish success story, much of the economic success is not captured within the country. Again, these themes deserve a longer treatment and particularly in drawing out the lessons for entrepreneurship from the Irish case.
dfzb | The following chapter on New Zealand's film industry has a similar structure with a brief page at the end on Peter Jackson, of Lord of the Rings fame. This chapter characterises national and regional policy as "state entrepreneurship", while Jackson is an individual entrepreneur. There is excellent data and analysis of how policy in New Zealand has influenced the industry but it seems to me there is a problem with calling government activity entrepreneurship: governments are usually doing something and it cannot all be entrepreneurship. One would then need to take a tautological position of calling it entrepreneurship if it appears to have led to success. How about activity that turns out to be unsuccessful or does not add value? And the success story of Jackson the individual does not seem to have followed from the policies-rather referring to more traditional notions of entrepre- neurship, like establishing businesses and high-quality resources to support his work.
u6ty | Chapter 2 by Desmond Hui reviews East and Southeast Asian government policies and economic statistics where available for creative and cultural industries as they are variously defined with sections on Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong-some of the statistics are projection. Understandably these deal with differences of definition, which are helpful to bear in mind with comparison. The review gives a sense of how countries like South Korea and Singapore have had a succession of policies aimed at CCIs since the 1980s, while others like Japan only really embraced targeted policies in the 21st century. It concludes that Korea's sustained policy attention seems to have paid off in terms of market success in TV, music and animation industries. However, this reader is left with a desire for more analysis of the impact of policy, with such a brief impression in the conclusion after a chapter presenting raw facts. Assembling the facts is important, of course, but there is still much to understand about development of CCIs in Asia.
awvu | The following chapter by Maria Aggestam on music entrepre- neurs in Scandinavia again shows a refreshing perspective. While we know the importance of institutions like the Eurovision Song Contest for several Scandinavian musicians and bands; not only the most famous, Abba, I had not realised that the tango and its music was such a strong part of Finnish culture. According to Aggestam there is a lack of professional marketing skills holding back the international growth of Finnish tango, but most importantly its language. Lyrics are crucial and singers' and songwriters' insistence on the Finnish language ensure it remains a local phenomenon. Sweden, by contrast, has continued export success, notably with songwriting for American artists such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez. The chapter contains data and narrative on important institutions.
on9b | The second part of the book focuses on supporting the creative industries, including a chapter by Tom Fleming reviewing the investment and funding issues associated with creative firms; Ralph Brown on promoting entrepreneurship in arts education and the dilemmas and paradoxes of increased throughput of graduates, yet with a talent shortfall perceived by industry. These themes are returned to in a chapter by Calvin Taylor, while Linda Moss provides a transition economy perspective with a chapter on the support of creative enterprise in Russia. There is another

bd9h | In summary, this collection whets the appetite by shifting attention to countries that are less well researched in the creative industries field. They are fascinating vignettes that hint at a richer research landscape. I recommend both these books for scholars and students interested in these sectors. There is also much to interest the general reader. As a pair they complement each other and when read together they leave a more complete picture of the range and reach of the creative and cultural industries.
