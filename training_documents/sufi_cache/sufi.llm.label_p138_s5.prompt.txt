You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study
dpv6 | ARTICLE INFO
8r5j | ABSTRACT
2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

l5s6 | The rule is that:
yjnd | Something which was functional becomes prized for itself: whether it is an exercise becoming a ritual, or an individual worker becoming idolised, or a tool becoming a totem.
c7v3 | Whoever encourages this tendency will always find supporters, because this warp is already in the human environment, and its derivatives will seem 'right'.
iute | On the other hand, the concept of vehicle and instrument, of not seeing the wood for the trees, and other manifestations of this possible confusion, are so well established that there will always be people who will understand the importance of thinking straight on the container and that which is contained, and on other mani- festations, including the grub-chrysalis-butterfly one.
377g | The means and the end are not the same. Studies, courses and processes exist for determining, perceiving and profiting from the knowledge of 'means' and 'end *.
v79r | Do you remember Omar Khayyam saying:
555y | 'Temples and the Kaaba of Mecca are the houses of devotion/ striking the bell is the sound of worship/the girdle and church and rosary and cross/every one is the sign of devotion.'
7yeh | The tool becoming a totem is especially marked as a tendency when people want to generalise theories, laws and rules out of situations which require a greater flexibility than just one or two alternatives.
hfsl | 142
kmer | Concern and Campaign
5s1o | Q: If one feels something very strongly, is it not right to pass this on to others, to get them 'concerned', and to form bodies of people who have similar interests?
9mly | A: Any of these things might be right, or might be wrong, entirely depending upon what the subject in question is, and who the people involved are. I would have thought this inherent in the question. You only have to look about you to see the confusion and unhappiness caused by people indulging themselves by rush- ing about worrying other people and making them worriers-and hence inefficient - when concern and propaganda are no substi- tutes for knowledge and action. However, one of the great ad- vantages of the fact that this 'wet-hen' behaviour is so widespread is that it provides almost daily illustrations of its ugliness and often destructive role, enabling us to avoid it when it is function- ing in that way.
znoh | Interestingly enough, it has not always been felt that agitation and recruitment are the answers to problems, or even that one does not benefit from sustaining problems, rather than always sharing them.
wjsb | We can also meditate on the words of the Anwar-i-Suhaili - 'The Lights of Canopus' - where it is said:
r5ov | The nightingale which cannot bear the thorn
gajg | It is best that it should never speak of the rose.
3j8z | Above all, I think that there is a need to know whether one is right, as well as a compulsion to believe that one is right and to convince others of this. The former attitude is just as im- portant, but the latter perhaps is the one more familiar to most people.
4dol | 'Concerned' people may be right, but they may only be satisfy- ing personal desires. To train other people to share these desires may be admissible: but only, I think, when they are recognised as
h72f | 143
v3n3 | desires, and not represented as necessities. In the latter case, if they are in fact not truths, both deception and self-deception are taking place. Can this be good?
t03d | THE MAN OF STRAW
2q4e | Saadi tells in The Boston of 'A wise youth from a decent land, who joined a community of people in Darband.' He was a person of 'excellence, intelligence and discernment' and the people re- ceived him well.
ktxm | One day the chief of the pious said to him: 'Go, scatter the rubbish from the mosque!'
y7mc | The youth went outside and disappeared. When he was seen the next day, he was accused of lack of respect for service, and selfishness, for not doing the sweeping:
nafx | 'Do you not know, O selfish infant, that men succeed through service?'
je6f | Now these people had assumed that he saw what they saw- the dust in the mosque. But he was not a superficialist like them:
ms51 | 'He began to weep, burning with sincerity: "I saw no dust or soil within that building .. I set off, so that the mosque should be clear of straw".'
v9sh | This man regarded himself as the pollutant of the mosque, while the others only thought of the campaign of cleaning and the concern for the superficial: even when there was no dust in the mosque, they still wanted it swept.
rnor | Saadi continues:
3tz7 | This only is the Way of the Dervish:
e02w | To humble his person.
0ldf | For eminence, choose humility!
4rgq | For to that roof, there is no ladder but this.
srag | The last line contains a play on words, and can also read, in the Persian: 'To that heaven there is no advance than this' ...
vm1l | Alas, people have not changed much since Saadi. Here is a sentence from a letter written to me by a famous man who is renowned for his spiritual virtues: 'I used to be proud and vain. Since I started to study Eastern teachings I am so humble you would hardly believe it.'
2ulk | 144
oc27 | Use, Misuse and Disuse of forms of Study
xv2d | Q: How can you explain the many forms in which people have attempted to teach? Since people believe in these forms, believe that they are true renditions of fact, they are enabled to reach truth through them. But is it that some are true and some are not, as the exponents of the organisations claim? If certain forms through which studies are carried out are true, are all the others false?
0yfu | A: I must have answered this question - or, rather, the ques- tions in this cluster - several hundred times, both in speech and in writing, including what I have written and quoted in books.
2icd | The fact that such questions continue to be asked constitutes a quite remarkable demonstration of what questioners are like: some at least will ask questions even though they have been answered in accessible form dozens of times.
ln4r | But this may mean that the questions need to be answered again and again, until the answers penetrate.
1iz9 | The answers, once again, are: -
o5cc | 1. Truth has no form;
b430 | 2. The means through which people may perceive Truth have forms;
5k15 | 3. All forms are limited. Some of the limitations are time, place, culture, language;
v24x | 4. Different forms are not necessarily antagonistic, for the above reasons;
26hh | 5. Forms have changed through the centuries in obedience to the external world to which all forms belong;
w533 | 6. When people believe that the form is more important than the Truth, they will not find truth, but will stay with form;
fj70 | 7. Forms are vehicles and instruments, and vehicles and instru- ments cannot be called good or bad without context;
04yk | 145
5l8x | 8. Forms outlive their usefulness, increase or diminish in use- fulness;
h425 | 9. These statements are abundantly to be found in the writings of Sufi teachers. They were written down in order to be read and remembered. They are seldom so energetically stated or so strongly maintained elsewhere, which may account for the fact that they have not been sufficiently heeded by people who have not given Sufi materials the study they deserve.
xfce | The outward forms of things of the world, about which Sufis so often speak, include the forms of teaching, which must be under- stood in their inward meaning, as well as exercising an instru- mental function.
trvq | Nasir-i-Khusru has truly said:
ztx4 | Your diver [for treasure] has only given you salty clay Because he has seen from you only envy.
d4i8 | Seek the meaning from the Outward like a man: Don't be like an ass, content with noise.
qp9u | THE CAT WITH A UNIVERSITY DEGREE
b6jo | In February 1975, a fine ginger tom-cat named Orlando was nominated in the Surrey University elections for President of the Students' Union. That the cat was a bona fide student seems evi- dent by the fact that it has a BSc. No doubt it will go on to a higher degree. This news story could very well, in traditional times, have been originated by a Sufi, as a comment on study and the times ...
f9x6 | 146
w558 | Potentiality and Function
18y0 | Q: What is the value of spiritual exercises?
779a | A: Here is a story for you:
v8xg | THE CHESS GAME
fmso | A certain countryman was being taught the game of chess. He was rather confused because the piece known as a castle was sometimes referred to as an elephant, sometimes as a castle, some- times as a rook, and so on.
ndxn | Finally he got the hang of the names, and the game started.
sb9k | Within a very few moves his teacher took one of his castles. Picking it up in fury, the countryman ground it under his foot, saying: 'Yes, you have enough names and wide-ranging moves, but in action we can see you are good for nothing!'
z2gn | What is the value of anything?
mgx1 | The value of spiritual exercises is to be of value to whom they can. The human interest should be to provide the right basis for the exercise, not to seek the exercise itself. The exercise is there and the need is there. What of the state of the individual?
x0do | Saadi, in the Rose Garden, says:
r8qt | The Sanctuary is in front and the thief is behind: If you go, you win, if you sleep, you die.
sga6 | If you perform spiritual exercises while still not able to dis- tinguish them from emotional activities, you will only be adding to your emotional life. This is why they are always prescribed in authentic schools, unlike the circus system of making everyone do them in imitative cults.
7af5 | Perhaps one of the best ways of remembering this is to liken it to the story of the fat man who was eating an enormous meal. Someone said to him: 'Aren't you on a diet?' He said: "Yes, but
uds2 | 147
jp0o | I have had my diet for today. This is my dinner.'
akty | Conditioning can be so all-enveloping that it takes over systems which were originally flexible and specific, generalising them out of all recognition, though unfortunately not out of popularity.
olz9 | This has given rise to a rather wan joke, which nevertheless has a certain minatory quality:
5rex | DO YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?
hiwi | A wandering dervish sat down beside a tousled figure at the roadside, who began to say:
zsp2 | T can't pray, I can't understand Sufi classics, I don't like esoteric exercises ... '
qzw0 | 'Then give it all up' advised the dervish.
6hya | 'But how can I? I am a famous "Sufi teacher" in these parts ... '
h0lh | 148
u5th | Conditioning and Education
kelb | Q : You seem to say that people are trained by many ordinary in- stitutions in a manner which people call brainwashing or condition- ing. But if psychologists have discovered that this is the way man is trained, what can be done about it, and what is wrong with it?
xtdb | A: There is no doubt that people are conditioned, and that what they call their opinions and beliefs are frequently not their own but implanted by other people and institutions. Among others, the Sufi Al-Ghazzali pointed this out almost a thousand years ago.
f48k | But the assumption that all human education, training and development must be done by these methods is as unnecessary as to imagine, say, that because a tomato can be force-ripened that there is no other way for a tomato to ripen.
pg0s | Conditioning is necessary, but it will function only for certain purposes.
aiap | Other purposes need other approaches. The Anwar-i-Suhaili says:
55v8 | The world is a hill and our actions are a shout; The echo of the shout comes back to us. Even though the wall throws a long shadow, The shadow itself still runs back to the wall.
6sol | Sufi learning comes through nutrition, as it were, in the sense that Tustari answered the question "What is food?' He said: ' "Food" is the contemplation of the Living One.'
gtra | The community of those who have self-realisation is regarded, by Ibn Arabi and others, as 'organic', except that this organisation is far more subtle and effective than that which gave us the analogy in the first place.
bhjq | The secondary self stands in the way of learning, and it will be conditioned unless it is 'polished'- another technical term, liken-
67jy | 149
u6kp | ing it to a mirror on which dust has settled, again emphasised by Ibn Arabi (in his Fusus) as well as by the classical and con- temporary exponents of Sufism.

03xu | The Search for an Honest Man
54ay | THERE always comes a time when instruction-materials which were originally employed to direct the attention of certain people towards a certain aim are adopted as 'gospel', or else simplified out of all usefulness and shallowly interpreted.
aohh | A possible example of the latter is the current idea of the meaning of Diogenes' looking with a lamp, in broad daylight, for an honest man.
pb0r | People think that he did this to indicate how rare were honest men. In fact, this procedure can be seen as a perfectly ob- vious example of someone directing attention to the whole question: not only to the rarity of honest men, but to the problem as to whether, how and where they might be found. The ambiguity of interpretation appears only when the student does not give both interpretative explanations equal value.
5j88 | Diogenes, who died in 323 B.C., is known as the founder of the school called the Cynics. Their purpose was to teach that attach- ment to 'things of the world' was slavery. Today's cynics are, ironically, attached to, slaves of, cynicism.
nfec | Again, honesty as an aim must have an archetype beyond the actual dishonesty of humankind. Saadi gives this prayer:
b5nq | Do to me what is worthy of Thee
p2om | Not that which is worthy of me.
ynxq | The action of teachings differs greatly from their description. Teachings must therefore always remain fresh and flexible, unless we are to deal in terms of the 'secret herb' which I mentioned at Geneva .*
uoj7 | Honesty is, of course, not easy: because real honesty is exer- cised without difficulty when it is the manifestation of an inner reality, not when it is a duty or difficulty. But certain principles can be used to illustrate the activity of an honest man or woman.
vwkw | *Idries Shah, The Elephant in the Dark (Geneva University Lectures) London: Octagon 1974, p. 69, contains this story.

xclk | TALE OF HATIM
pah4 | When Hatim al-Asamm, of Balkh (now in Afghanistan) went to Baghdad, people surrounded him, saying:
2avs | 'You are a non-Arab of halting speech, yet you silence everyone.'
d0nn | He answered: 'Three things enable me to overcome my oppo- nent. I am happy when he is right, and I am sad when he is wrong, and I try not to behave foolishly towards him.'
nv44 | Ibn Hanbal asked Hatim what things would save humanity from the world. He said:
l6cw | 'There are four things. Accept the ignorance of others and spare them yours; spare for them from your substance, and do not expect any of theirs.'
z8po | The posture of honesty is not the same as its reality, as everyone knows. But how many people can tell whether they are honest or behaving as if they were honest?
wm8m | A certain tale has been coined to give this important subject expression. In order to illustrate, it has been put into the mouth of two lunatics; which should not really make any of us feel that its equivalence could not occur among us marvellously normal people:
fmj9 | First lunatic religionist: 'God spoke to me!'
50jk | Second ditto: 'I did no such thing!'
fvhd | 152
6jwe | How can one method be as good as another?
keja | Q: What you have said about the same person, or the same group of people, being able to employ entirely different techniques to achieve the same object interests me. But how can one method be as good as another?
