        "content": "cb7r | They'd given him no choice, Patel reasoned. Somewhere along the way, the plot against the king had turned into a plot against the wizard himself.\n68xu | By the winter of twenty eighteen, Republicans had lost the House, and Schiff was set to take over the intelligence committee. Patel later wrote that Nunes, as promised, urged Trump to hire his protégé onto the National Security Council. According to Patel, when Trump realized just whom Nunes was referring to-the man who \"had saved his presidency by revealing the unprecedented political hit job designed to take him down\"-he ordered his chief of staff to onboard Patel at once.\nhd35 | Former administration officials told me that, from his first days as a staffer on the National Security Council, in February twenty nineteen, Patel was fixated on trying to get face time with Trump. He had a script, and it wasn't long before many of his colleagues could recite it themselves: \"Mr. President, the deep state is out to get you,\" as the longtime Trump adviser paraphrased it, \"and I'm going to save you from it.\" Five months into his tenure, Patel was made the senior director of the NSC's counterterrorism directorate.\n2zpk | Much has been written about Patel's year on the National Security Council, including the early suspicions among his colleagues that he was funneling information about Ukraine directly to Trump, outside official channels. In the former president's first impeachment inquiry, the NSC official Fiona Hill testified about learning from another colleague that Trump apparently viewed Patel as the council's director on\nepu7 | Ukraine policy, though his portfolio had nothing to do with Ukraine. Hill said she had been sufficiently alarmed to report the conversation to her superior and then warn her colleagues to be \"very careful\" in their communications with Patel. \"Let's just say it's a red flag,\" she testified, \"when somebody who you barely know is involved on one of your policy issues\" and \"clearly providing materials outside of the line\"-particularly when she didn't know what those materials were.\n7od1 | Patel has repeatedly denied ever discussing Ukraine with Trump. In his rendering, his colleagues were jealous of his close relationship with the president and still hated him for the Russia investigation. Not only was the deep state's plot against him still in motion, Patel seemed to decide, but it had expanded.\n0bqy | For the most part, this is how he explains the rest of his time in the Trump administration, why it is that at virtually every turn-from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to the Department of Defense to very nearly the FBI and CIA-there emerges yet another crop of officials who object to his accrual of power. It could not possibly be the case, for example, that Bill Barr harbored genuine concerns about Patel's qualifications to serve as deputy FBI director: In Patel's version of events, Barr was simply one more top bureaucrat bent on foiling Patel's success as payback for the \"mess\" he'd exposed in their agency. And if this narrative begins to feel less and less plausible, if Patel's latest detractors have to date seemed as reliably pro-Trump as Patel himself-well, that just goes to show their cunning.\nb780 | Patel has a talent for casting himself as the ultimate hero or the unjustly persecuted. I have wondered if this is why he chose not to include in his book the events of October thirty, twenty twenty-if, in the end, not even he could figure out a way to make himself the martyr of the story.\nccmb | On that Friday, according to multiple reported accounts, SEAL Team Six was awaiting the Pentagon's green light on a rescue mission in West Africa. The day before, the administration had learned where gunmen were holding Philip Walton, a twenty-seven-year-old American who had been kidnapped that week from his farm near Niger's border with Nigeria. As multiple agencies now coordinated on final details for the evening operation, the State Department worked to resolve the last outstanding task-\nma93 | securing airspace permission from Nigerian officials. Around noon, Patel called the Pentagon with an update: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he said, had gotten the approval. The mission was a go.\nc6hh | The SEALs were close to landing in Nigeria when Defense Secretary Mark Esper discovered that the State Department had not, in fact, secured the overflight clearance, as Patel had claimed. The aircraft were quickly diverted, flying in circles for the next hour as officials scrambled to alert the Nigerian government to their position. With the operation window narrowing, Esper and Pompeo called the Situation Room to put the decision to the president: Either they abort the mission and risk their hostage being killed, or they proceed into foreign airspace and risk their soldiers being shot down.\ny7ea | But then, suddenly, the deputy secretary of state was on the line, Esper later wrote in his memoir: They'd been cleared.\nnav4 | Soon Walton was reunited with his family.\ngem8 | What had happened?\ne8nr | Celebratory feelings gave way to anger as officials tried to make sense of Patel's bad report. According to Esper, Pompeo claimed that at no point had he even spoken with Patel about the mission, much less told him he'd received the airspace rights. Esper wrote that his team suspected that Patel had simply \"made the approval story up.\"\nk78w | Anthony Tata, the Pentagon official and retired Army general to whom Patel had originally given the green light, confronted Patel in a rage. \"You could've gotten these guys killed!\" Tata shouted, according to two people familiar with the exchange. \"What the fuck were you thinking?\"\ng9du | Patel's response was: \"If nobody got hurt, who the fuck cares?\"\nf682 | Patel denies saying this, or making up the approval story. He \"would never jeopardize an operation, American hostages or our soldiers,\" he said through his spokesperson. \"In every situation, including this one, I followed the chain of command.\"\nli1k | But three former senior administration officials independently cited the near catastrophe in West Africa as one of their foremost recollections from Patel's tenure. They remain unsettled by Patel's actions in large part because they still have no clue what motivated them. If Patel had in fact just invented the story, as Esper's team concluded, then why? Was it because the election was in four days, and Patel was simply that impatient to set in motion a final potential victory for Trump, whatever the risk-was it as darkly cynical as that? Did his lack of experience mean he just had no grasp of the consequences?\npbea | Some people close to the former president privately vent about Patel and whatever they last heard him say on a far-right podcast or at a fundraiser, particularly if it involves some overstatement of his administration activities. The longtime Trump adviser said he had been in Patel's presence, more than once, when he'd claimed he was the person who \"gave the order\" for U.S. forces to move in and kill the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in twenty nineteen-an operation for which Patel, by his own admission, wasn't even in the Situation Room. (Asked about this, Patel said through his spokesperson: \"Trump made that brave and courageous call.\")\nccpt | One of the former senior administration officials, meanwhile, sent me a photo of what he said was Patel's challenge coin, a small, customizable medallion for service members and government officials. In addition to a curious image of a drone illuminating (targeting?) a dollar sign in front of the White House, the coin features an assortment of national-security-adjacent terms, including direct action, sanctions, HEZ slash Iran, and cyber. \"It's just random stuff,\" the former official said. \"Half of this stuff, he wasn't even involved in.\" (Through the spokesperson, Patel neither confirmed nor denied having such a coin.)",
