Once medical therapy has failed, palliative surgeries such as vagus nerve stimulation or corpus callosotomy are considered. Although corpus callosotomy is more effective than vagus nerve stimulation as the primary neurosurgical treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome-associated drop attacks, there are limited data regarding the added value of corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of corpus callosotomy preceded by vagus nerve stimulation.\nbqfb | Methods: This multinational, multicenter retrospective study focuses on Lennox-Gastaut syndrome children who underwent corpus callosotomy before the age of eighteen years, following prior vagus nerve stimulation, which failed to achieve satisfactory seizure control. Collected data included\nwwdt | epilepsy characteristics, surgical details, epilepsy outcomes, and complications. The primary outcome of this study was a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks.\nmn1r | Results: A total of one hundred twenty-seven cases were reviewed (eighty males). The median age at epilepsy onset was six months. The median age at vagus nerve stimulation surgery was seven years, and corpus callosotomy was performed at a median age of eleven years. The dominant seizure type was drop attacks (tonic or atonic) in one hundred two patients. Eighty-six patients underwent a single-stage complete corpus callosotomy, and forty-one an anterior callosotomy. Ten patients who did not initially have a complete corpus callosotomy underwent a second surgery for completion of corpus callosotomy due to seizure persistence. Overall, there was at least a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks and other seizures in eighty-three percent and sixty percent, respectively. Permanent morbidity occurred in one point five percent, with no mortality.\n5vqw | Significance: Corpus callosotomy is vital in seizure control in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in whom vagus nerve stimulation has failed. Surgical risks are low. A complete corpus callosotomy has a tendency toward better effectiveness than anterior corpus callosotomy for some seizure types.\nmeyw | One INTRODUCTION\n2e62 | Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to control through antiseizure medications. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may cause generalized seizure phenotypes, and significantly impact neurodevelopmental aspects such as learning, behavior, alertness, and quality of life. Thus, seizure reduction is of utmost importance, especially in young children. Moreover, drop seizures, which occur in more than half of the patients, are a significant source of morbidity, causing severe injuries, and are among the most disabling factors in this syndrome. Many such patients require close and continuous supervision and head protection with special helmets.\n75y3 | Once conventional antiseizure medications have failed, palliative surgeries such as vagus nerve stimulation or corpus callosotomy should be considered. A comparison of the effectiveness and safety of corpus callosotomy and vagus nerve stimulation, which are the most common palliative surgical methods, suggests that corpus callosotomy is more effective than vagus nerve stimulation in reducing atonic seizure; there is seventy-four to eighty-five percent reduction in tonic and atonic seizures following corpus callosotomy, compared to approximately fifty-five percent reduction following vagus nerve stimulation. However, corpus callosotomy is associated with a higher rate of adverse events when compared to vagus nerve stimulation. For this reason, in many cases, physicians or family favor vagus nerve stimulation over corpus callosotomy as the primary surgical palliative treatment.\ns2g2 | Although corpus callosotomy is more effective than vagus nerve stimulation as the primary treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome-associated drop attacks, there are limited data regarding the added value of corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation.\ncb7r | Key Points\n68xu | Corpus callosotomy has an added value on all seizure subtypes in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who have undergone prior vagus nerve stimulation\nhd35 | Complete corpus callosotomy has a tendency toward better effectiveness than anterior corpus callosotomy\n2zpk | Additional studies are needed to ascertain the low morbidity associated with complete callosotomy\nepu7 | The current study evaluates the safety of corpus callosotomy and its effectiveness for drop attacks and other seizure types following prior vagus nerve stimulation for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\n7od1 | Two MATERIALS AND METHODS\n0bqy | This is a multicenter, multinational, retrospective, historical cohort study. Following institutional review board approval, we retrospectively reviewed the files of all children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who underwent corpus callosotomy (complete or incomplete) following a prior vagus nerve stimulation. Seventy-one international epilepsy centers were invited to participate based on personal contacts. No institutions were excluded; twenty-seven did not respond, seventeen centers had no cases meeting the inclusion criteria, one declined participation, and twenty-six centers contributed one hundred forty-five patients (ranging from one to eighteen patients from each participating center) operated on between two thousand three and two thousand twenty-one.\nb780 | Two point one Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nccmb | Children (up to eighteen years of age during corpus callosotomy surgery) undergoing corpus callosotomy surgery, who also underwent a prior vagus nerve stimulation for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, were included in the study. The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome diagnosis was based on the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy. All variations of corpus callosotomy were included (anterior, posterior, complete, open disconnections, and radiofrequency or laser ablation). All Lennox-Gastaut syndrome etiologies were included. Other epileptic syndromes (unrelated to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) and patients who underwent vagus nerve stimulation following prior corpus callosotomy were excluded.\nma93 | Two point two Collected data\nc6hh | Collected data included demographics, epilepsy etiology, age at seizure onset, and seizure semiology. Surgical data included any prior epilepsy-related surgery (including resections, but not including corpus callosotomy), data regarding vagus nerve stimulation surgery (including complications and effectiveness on drop seizures and other seizures), data regarding corpus callosotomy surgery (including technique, extent, complications, and effectiveness), and the need for additional surgeries.\ny7ea | Two point three Study outcomes\nnav4 | The primary outcome was effectiveness of corpus callosotomy in reducing fifty percent of drop attacks at the last follow-up despite failure of a prior vagus nerve stimulation. Secondary outcome measures were other seizure reductions, role of extent of callosotomy, and safety.\ngem8 | Two point four Statistical analysis\ne8nr | Data were tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet. SPSS software was used for all statistical analyses. Categorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages. Comparison between outcomes of partial and complete callosotomy was done using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables are reported as median and interquartile range. Correlation between\n```",
