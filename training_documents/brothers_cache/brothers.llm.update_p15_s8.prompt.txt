You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

b2lm | Newspaper reports indicate that a 'road-map' for peace was agreed upon as early as January 2019.53 Simultaneously, rumours have circulated that an agreement had
ti7f | been reached on a detailed framework regulating cross-border movement of people and goods, and that only President Isaias Afwerki's approval was pending.54
oksu | On the issue of demilitarisation and border demarcation, no concrete movements have been made beyond some redeployment of troops away from the border zone. Ethiopian military forces still occupy territories granted to Eritrea by the EEBC, including the symbolic village of Badme and the more sensitive Irob area. No territories have been vacated and returned to Eritrea.55
wtow | Likewise, Eritrea maintains full mobilisation and has not yet announced any plans to demobilise or to reform the open-ended national service obligation. Neither have any plans been announced for broader political and economic reforms, as for instance instituting the Eritrean Parliament, or implementing the suspended Eritrean Constitution. The country is still governed by Presidential Decrees.
o22k | The formal rapprochement initiated last summer has even taken a step back, with the unexpected unilateral decision by Asmara to close the border crossings for Ethiopians to enter Eritrea in late December 2018,56 without any official explan- ation given by Eritrean (or Ethiopian) authorities as to why this was imposed.57 Only the Oumhajir-Humera crossing remained partly open for traffic, until it was closed suddenly in late April 2019.58
nwfz | Subsequently, further restrictions were imposed on Eritreans wanting to cross the ground border into Ethiopia by apparently introducing a differentiated policy. The Eritrean border population is apparently allowed to cross back-and forth on foot with few obstacles.59 Eritreans from Asmara and other inland towns, however, need to apply for permission from their local authorities to travel to Ethiopia. They must then obtain an exit visa from the immigration authorities in Asmara (presum- ably similar to an ordinary exit visa).60 At the border, Eritrean authorities seem to have established an immigration facility where 'inland' Eritreans need to show their exit permit and register before being allowed to cross over to Zalambessa. People without permits are still crossing, but taking a one-hour detour around the formal check-point. If they are discovered by Eritrean border guards, they are reportedly just ordered to turn back without any further sanction.61 The active shoot-to-kill policy has thus seemingly been lifted.
nvfy | Failure to institutionalise peace
mror | Ethiopia announced in late May 2019 that two trade agreements had been submit- ted to Asmara for endorsement.62 One agreement regulated cross-border petty trade, and the other focused on bilateral trade. Interviews conducted in Addis Ababa with high-level government representatives during spring and summer 2019, however, suggested that these agreements, in addition to a port agreement regulating Ethiopian use of the Eritrean Red Sea ports, in reality had been finalised in early 2019, but were pending Eritrean input which had been constantly delayed.
zlxc | Key Ethiopian officials admit off-the-record that 'it takes two to tango'; they are frustrated and do not understand why President Isaias Afwerki does not appear to want to move forward and institutionalise the peace process. Even Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed alluded to this when he visited Axum in June 2019: in response to a question from the audience about when the border would be reopened, he admitted that the peace process had stalled. 'It is not only up to us to open the border; there are two sides to the process', he explained to an impatient crowd of Tigrayans.63 According to Dr Abraha Negash, Vice President of Tigray, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed also alluded to President Isaias Afwerki's unpredictability in moving the process forward; he believed he had secured an agreement with President Isaias Afwerki to reopen the Zalambessa border crossing in early May 2019, as the regional government in Tigray received a call from the prime minister's office 'to be ready' in Zalambessa for cross-border traffic.64 The regional government sent rein- forcements of police and administrative personnel to the border, but nothing hap- pened, and the border remains closed at the time of writing (November 2019). Despite the stand-still of institutionalisation of the peace process and the lack of response from Asmara, the Ethiopian government is preparing a peace dividend with Eritrea by furthering economic collaboration and integration, with policies aiming to establish joint economic activities along their long border and revamping the infrastructure between the two countries.65
k0bw | Inside Eritrea, however, there are few signs of similar activity. Allegedly, rapproche- ment with Ethiopia had been discussed at some meetings at different political and administrative levels after the signing of the peace agreement.66 Some interpret this as a preparation for reforms. So far however, no public commitments or statements have been made to this effect. Indeed, in speeches made by President Isaias Afwerki on Liberation Day, 24 May and Martyrs' Day, 20 June 2019, he neither commented on the peace agreements nor hinted at any forthcoming reforms. Rather, he has used the opportunity to tell the Eritrean people that this is a time to consolidate and take
aq5a | stock of their development efforts, and continue their struggle for development as nothing has changed.67 Likewise, two months after the Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (in beginning of December 2019), neither President Isaias Afwerki nor any of his spokespeople had publicly commented upon the award or congratulated their 'brother in peace'.
sc5y | The absence of any institutionalisation of the peace declaration is obviously an increasing concern. Without this, considering the history of outbreak of war in 1998,68 the unpredictability of the process is glaring. Currently, the 'peace' and 'reconciliation' content of the formal agreement are concepts held hostage by the political elites in both countries, without any border-population input or influence. Similarly, the resecuritisation of the border restricts its permeability and the possi- bility of advancing reconciliation and renegotiation of borderlands' identities.
0yab | Consolidating peace and reconciliation bottom-up?
w95z | Notwithstanding the hobbled formal top-level negotiation process and the set-back of closing the border, informal people-to-people reconciliation continues. Border populations are reconnecting as individuals and families, neighbouring commun- ities, and even as local government administrators, and security forces on both sides of the border. Eritreans in the borderlands cross back and forth every day, although in dwindling numbers, for petty trade, to buy necessities, to visit friends and family, or to participate in religious or social ceremonies.
