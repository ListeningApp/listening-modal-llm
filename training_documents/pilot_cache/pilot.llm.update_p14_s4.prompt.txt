You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

0fpw | Philosophically, some respondents viewed the term emerging practice as a misnomer. Emerging practice was perceived as a resurgence of pre- vious roles and practice settings or a natural evolution in the profession rather than a new phenomenon within the profession. Among the divergent views about emerging practice, participants questioned whether emerging practice is potentially detrimental to the profession and its future. While some respondents thought it to be a critical element of the profession's transformation from the medical model to community-based practices and alternative models of service delivery (Baum, 2000; Scaffa, 2001), others suggested it serves to further confuse occupational therapy practitioners, other professionals, and the public about the profession's identity and scope of practice. This dichotomy of opinions appears to characterize Bruhn's (1993) description of the "boundary dilemma" (p. 26) within the profession regarding the expansion of practice beyond the medical and rehabilitation environments. The study results indicate there is a degree of uncertainty about whether the profession's domain of practice should include the de- livery of services outside the health care arena.
dqn8 | Are the views of emerging practice and its role within the profession held by the study participants significant and representative of the profession at large? One possible answer may be found in the theory of paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn (1996), paradigm shifts follow a predictable process within a profession. During the preparadigm stage, proposed changes to the common values and practices of a profession are discussed among its mem- bers. As a new paradigm emerges, unsettlement and change often leads to a period of crisis until the new paradigm is adopted. If the profession of occupational therapy is indeed undergoing a paradigm shift to its third paradigm (Kielhofner, 2004) with a return to a focus on the occupational nature of humans and occupation-based practice (Baum, 2000; Gilfoyle, 1984; Grady, 1990; Jacobs, 2002a, 2002b), then perhaps the perceptions, opinions, and questions about emerging practice are inherent within the transition of paradigms. As Kielhofner observed, a paradigm shift repre- sents a crises within a profession because its "members find it unsettling to abandon the way of thinking and doing that the paradigm provides. In everyday language, we might say that a paradigm shift represents a change of both mind and heart" (p. 29). Emerging practice, as described by the small sample in this study, could be viewed as a component of the paradigm shift within the profession.
cop0 | Second, emerging practice presents opportunities for professional growth and satisfaction as well as significant barriers to its advancement.
lhkq | The many rewards and challenges of emerging practice are both intrinsic and extrinsic in nature. Respondents provided multiple examples of the opportunities emerging practice offers for professional growth and satis- faction including demonstrating the value of the profession and seeing the positive results of their work with clients. As well, for many practitioners, being on the forefront of a practice area provided welcome opportunities for creativity, independence, and collaboration with other professionals, service providers, and community members.
82ju | At the same time, the challenges experienced in emerging practice ap- pear to be formidable. The results indicate a common barrier is obtaining funding for services in settings in which third-party reimbursement is un- available. Additionally, occupational therapy practitioners often need to acquire skills in marketing, business management, and program develop- ment, which necessitate a commitment of time and financial resources. Participants also identified the issues of professional regulation, scope of practice, professional isolation, and a lack of sufficient evidence-based research as significant challenges to establishing and maintaining a suc- cessful emerging practice. Similar obstacles have been noted by other oc- cupational therapy practitioners seeking to provide services in new areas of practice (Brownson, 1998; Jacobs, 2002b; Loukas, 2000). While acknowl- edging the challenges associated with developing innovative services in community settings, Loukas offered five models to guide therapists in es- tablishing opportunities for clients to improve occupational performance in "real-life environments" (p. 3) based on successful examples within the profession across a variety of settings. The diversity of these service de- livery models present opportunities for therapists to identify one that best matches the need of the clients to be served with the knowledge and skills of the practitioner.
y2qo | Implications
1piq | Continuing professional dialogue and the development of a position paper on emerging practice by AOTA may assist practitioners and aca- demicians alike in reaching consensus about the fundamental issues re- lated to the role of emerging practice within the profession, its required competencies, and future course. Ultimately, the continuance and growth of emerging practice will depend on thoughtful decisions and the ongoing support of the profession's members.
7fqw | While the participants in the current study addressed the value found in mentoring occupational therapy students in emerging practices, the limited
rhaz | number of occupational therapists in emerging practice settings has impli- cations for preparing occupational therapy graduates for future practice. In a recent study of Level I fieldwork, Johnson, Koenig, Piersol, Santalucia, and Wachter-Schultz (2006) linked the increasing frequency of supervision by nonoccupational therapy personnel to an increasing number of emerg- ing practice settings. Among the health professions, a shared concern for the preparation and support of clinical/fieldwork educators or preceptors who supervise students in clinical and community settings is contribut- ing to the development of new program and curricular models (Marriott et al., 2005; Turnock, Moran, Scammell, Mallik, & Mulholland, 2005). As well, a variety of models for student supervision in practice settings are being implemented and evaluated. Collaborative (more than one student per supervisor), interdisciplinary (supervision provided by a professional outside of a student's discipline), and multiple mentoring (two or more students mentored by two or more clinicians) are three models applied to fieldwork experiences (Bartholomai & Fitzgerald, 2007; Strohschein, Hagler, & May, 2002). Continued development of supervision models and strategies will be necessary to educate and support occupational ther- apy and nonoccupational therapy personnel alike to meet the supervi- sory and mentoring needs of occupational therapy students for emerging practice.
wak1 | Greater information dissemination about emerging practice activities and outcomes through electronic and other media could address the sense of isolation voiced by practitioners in this study. More frequent topic- specific articles in the professional literature could assist the profession in further understanding the new directions in practice and models of service delivery. While the AOTA SISs and associated quarterly newslet- ters address a breadth of practice areas, a specific SIS for emerging or community-based practices may allow therapists to more easily network and collaborate about issues specific to developing and delivering services in those practice settings.
wtfz | Regulatory bodies and policy makers are in the position to facilitate or impede emerging practice and its future development through state practice acts that define and regulate the scope of occupational therapy practice. As such, members of regulatory boards, state professional associations, and agencies should be key participants in the decisions that will shape the future role of emerging practice.
qy1i | Finally, the study results clearly articulated the need for the pro- fession and its members to support and conduct timely research to document the efficacy of occupational therapy services in emerging practice. The research findings would add to the body of evidence
1k9e | supporting the value and effectiveness of occupational therapy practice and services.
