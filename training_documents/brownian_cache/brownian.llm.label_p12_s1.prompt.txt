You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

oxou | As the equilibrium variance is also easily computed from the Boltzmann distribution, equation (121) gives us a second test to verify that the effective potential has been computed correctly, at least around the minimum.
495n | In the LPA approximation the variance and the de- cay rate of the autocorrelation function are both directly given by the curvature of the effective potential at its minimum. The inclusion of WFR however alters the de- cay rate without changing the equilibrium variance. This is as it should be since the latter is fixed by the equi- librium Boltzmann distribution. As we will see, WFR improves the decay rate which is indeed not exactly de- termined by the effective potential's curvature alone.
awri | V. SOLUTIONS TO THE FLOW EQUATIONS
bl28 | In this section we obtain the resulting effective poten- tial and wave function renormalisation for 3 types of po- tential. The first we consider is a simple polynomial in line with [16]:
d5bz | <LATEX>V \left( x \right) = 1 + x + \frac { x ^ { 2 } } { 2 } + \frac { 2 x ^ { 3 } } { 3 } + \frac { x ^ { 4 } } { 4 }</LATEX> (122)
ap5o | We will also consider a doublewell made by two <LATEX>\mathrm { L J }</LATEX> po- tentials back to back:
7zvf | <LATEX>V \left( x \right) = 4 \epsilon _ { 1 } \left( \frac { \sigma ^ { 1 2 } } { \left( x + 3 \right) ^ { 1 2 } } - \frac { \sigma ^ { 6 } } { \left( x + 3 \right) ^ { 6 } } \right)</LATEX> <LATEX>+ 4 \epsilon _ { 2 } \left( \frac { \sigma ^ { 1 2 } } { \left( x - 3 \right) ^ { 1 2 } } - \frac { \sigma ^ { 6 } } { \left( x - 3 \right) ^ { 6 } } \right)</LATEX> (123)
mov9 | where <LATEX>\sigma</LATEX> will be taken to be 1 from here on in and <LATEX>\epsilon _ { 1 }</LATEX> & <LATEX>\epsilon _ { 2 }</LATEX> represents the depth of each well. We will choose <LATEX>\epsilon _ { 1 } = 1 , \epsilon _ { 2 } = 1 0 \text { nu }</LATEX> meaning the left well is 1 unit deep and the right units deep (in <LATEX>2 D _ { 0 } / \varepsilon</LATEX> units) and the potential is asymmetric. Clearly here the domain of in- terest is <LATEX>x \in \left( - 3 , 3 \right)</LATEX> as the potential diverges at <LATEX>x = \pm 3 .</LATEX> Finally we also consider a "bumpy" bare potential con- sisting of a simple <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> underlying potential with additional gaussian bumps (or dips):
ks7m | <LATEX>V \left( x \right) = x ^ { 2 } + \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } \alpha _ { i } \exp \left[ - \frac { \left( x - \beta _ { i } \right) ^ { 2 } } { \mu } \right]</LATEX> (124)
w1w1 | where there are <LATEX>n</LATEX> bumps or dips with the prefactor <LATEX>\alpha _ { i }</LATEX> being positive or negative respectively. We will focus on an x2 plus 3 bumps and 3 dips in an asymmetrical setup. This potential could represent a rudimentary toy model for motion over a "potential energy landscape" with a se- ries of local energy minima. This serves to clearly demon- strate the effect of local extrema on the final shape of the effective potential since the underlying <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential does not alter its shape under the RG flow. We chose the parameters to be for <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } + 6</LATEX> bumps/dips:
h8gv | <LATEX>\alpha _ { 1 } = \alpha _ { 4 } = \alpha _ { 5 } = - 1 . 5</LATEX> <LATEX>\alpha _ { 2 } = \alpha _ { 3 } = \alpha _ { 6 } = 1 . 5 , \mu = 0 . 0 6</LATEX> <LATEX>\beta _ { 1 } = - \beta _ { 2 } = 0 . 7 , \beta _ { 3 } = - \beta _ { 4 } = 1 . 4 , \beta _ { 5 } = - \beta _ { 6 } = 2 . 1</LATEX> (125)

The dotted blue curve indicates the bare potential which is progressively changed, through dot-dashed green and dashed yellow, into the solid red, effective potential, as fluctuations are integrated out.
yj0m | expressed in dimensionless units (we have set <LATEX>\widehat { x } \rightarrow x</LATEX> to avoid notational clutter).
ewfp | We solve the LPA flow equation (88) on a grid in the <LATEX>\chi</LATEX> direction and using an adaptive step size Runge- Kutta ODE solver to evolve in the <LATEX>k</LATEX> direction. A similar approach was used for including (96). The numerical derivatives in the <LATEX>\chi</LATEX> direction were based on a finite dif- ference scheme using the Fornberg method with a stencil size of 5 for the potentials under study. While increas- ing the grid size improves the accuracy of the numerical derivative it also increases the number of coupled ODEs to be solved, making the integration much more com- putationally expensive. A balance must be drawn de- pending on the potential in question. For our cases we considered 1001 points and <LATEX>x \in \left( - 3 , 3 \right)</LATEX> for the unequal L-J potential and <LATEX>x \in \left( - 5 , 5 \right)</LATEX> for the other two. Figs. 1, 2, 4, 3 and 5, display the results.

Again, the bare potential is denoted by the dotted blue curve and the <LATEX>k = 0</LATEX> effective potential by the solid red one.

As <LATEX>k \rightarrow 0</LATEX> is approached, a distinct single minimum develops, indicating the average position of the particle. As expected, the lower the temperature, the closest the effective minimum is to the bare poten- tial's global minimum, reflecting the relative weakness of fluctuations to force the particle to spend time away from it. As one might expect, it takes 'longer' in <LATEX>k</LATEX> evo- lution for local features - e.g. barriers - to disappear in the <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1</LATEX> case as fluctuations at each <LATEX>k \quad s c a l e \quad h a v e</LATEX> less energy than their equivalent for the <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0</LATEX> and the particle's stochastic motion between barriers is less frequent. Physically this means that the fluctuations we have integrated out up to scale <LATEX>k</LATEX> do not contribute significantly to the particle moving between minima.
me84 | We see a similar phenomenon in Fig. 3 for the flow from the bare to the effective potential for <LATEX>\Upsilon = 3 ,</LATEX> and <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1</LATEX> for an <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential with 6 gaussian bumps/dips. Here the original Langevin potential is much more com-

slz6 | plicated than in the previous two cases but the fRG is still able to smoothen out these features in a non-trivial way. This example further demonstrates how the flow of the effective potential is driven by the local curvature, the gaussian features imposed here, since for an <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential the fRG flow equation (88) yields no change beyond an unphysical shift by an overall additive constant.
90k5 | It is clear in all three figures that at the high temper- ature there is not much change in the shape of the po- tential when <LATEX>k</LATEX> has reached the value given by the green, dot-dashed line. Physically this means that the fluctua- tions integrated out in this range do not contribute signif- icantly to the particle evolution and transition between minima. However, by the time <LATEX>k</LATEX> has been lowered to the value of the yellow, dashed line we have started to inte- grate over fluctuations over timescales relevant for inter- minima transitions. Naturally, when <LATEX>k = 0</LATEX> is reached the potential is fully convex (as it must be by definition of T) with no local features to overcome. Similar behaviour is obtained where again we consider the corresponding

hx9e | the evolution different but the final shape of <LATEX>V _ { k = 0 } \left( x \right)</LATEX> is different for the two different temperature regimes. Both the position and gradient near the global minimum are changed. This is suggestive of longer time scales required at lower temperatures to reach equilibrium. It also indi- cates longer times for the equilibrium covariance to decay, as we discuss below.
ywn2 | Regarding WFR, the full numerical solutions to (96) for the unequal L-J potential at <LATEX>\Upsilon = 1 0 , 2</LATEX> and for an <LATEX>x ^ { 2 }</LATEX> potential with 6 gaussian bumps/dips at <LATEX>\Upsilon = 3 ,</LATEX> are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. We see that from the initial condition, <LATEX>\zeta _ { x } = 1</LATEX> everywhere, features appear as <LATEX>k \rightarrow 0</LATEX> in direct contrast with the evolution of the effective higher temperatures it is clear that <LATEX>a t \quad k = 0 \quad a \quad l o c a l</LATEX> minima appears at the same place as the global minimum for the effective potential where the height of the local minima is linked to the equilibrium covariance - see equation (119). Looking at Fig. 4 (b) however we can see that this is no longer the case and the features generated by the fRG flow are much greater than in the high temperature case. We will see later that the neighbouring features in <LATEX>\zeta _ { x }</LATEX> will help to better describe dynamical evolution than the bare potential alone.
