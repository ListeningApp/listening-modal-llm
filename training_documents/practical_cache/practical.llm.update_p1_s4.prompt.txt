You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | Practical approach for the diagnosis of biliary atresia on imaging, part 2: magnetic resonance cholecystopancreatography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous liver biopsy, risk scores and decisional flowchart
0fpw | Abstract
dqn8 | We aim to present a practical approach to imaging in suspected biliary atresia, an inflammatory cholangiopathy of infancy resulting in progressive fibrosis and obliteration of extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts. Left untreated or with failure of the Kasai procedure, biliary atresia progresses to biliary cirrhosis, end-stage liver failure and death within the first years of life. Differentiating biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is difficult as there is no single method for diagnosing biliary atresia and clinical, laboratory and imaging features of this disease overlap with those of other causes of neonatal cholestasis. In this second part, we discuss the roles of magnetic resonance (MR) cholecystopancreatography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, percutaneous biopsy and percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography. Among imaging techniques, ultrasound (US) signs have a high specificity, although a normal US examination does not rule out biliary atresia. Other imaging techniques with direct opacification of the biliary tree combined with percutaneous liver biopsy have roles in equivocal cases. MR cholecystopancreatography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy are not useful for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. We propose a decisional flowchart for biliary atresia diagnosis based on US signs, including elastography, percutaneous cholecysto- cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and liver biopsy.
cop0 | Introduction
lhkq | Biliary atresia is an important cause of obstructive jaundice in infants causing progressive fibrosis and obliteration of extra- hepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts and resulting in biliary cirrhosis in the absence of early surgery. Jaundice with pale
82ju | stools and dark urine is present within the first days or weeks of life. The prevalence of biliary atresia ranges from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 20,000 worldwide depending on the geographic area, with the highest prevalence in Taiwan [1-3]. The aetiology of biliary atresia is unknown and different causes have been pro- posed including viral infections, genetic factors or toxins [4].
y2qo | There are two forms of biliary atresia: the non-syndromic form, which accounts for about 80% of cases, and the syndromic form, also called biliary atresia splenic malforma- tion syndrome, which accounts for about 20% of cases [3]. The syndromic form is associated with polysplenia (asplenia), intestinal malrotation, preduodenal portal vein, interrupted
1piq | inferior vena cava, aberrant hepatic artery, abdominal heterotaxia and congenital heart disease [5]. There are also different subtypes of biliary atresia according to the extent of fibrosis in extrahepatic bile ducts and the presence of a cyst of the extrahepatic bile duct. In all cases, intrahepatic bile ducts
7fqw | are fibrotic, which explains the absence of bile duct dilatation despite a biliary obstacle [6] (Fig. 1). The histology is charac- terized by bile duct proliferation, bile plugs, portal or perilobular fibrosis, oedema and the preservation of the basic hepatic lobular architecture [7, 8]. Histology is not specific
rhaz | and disorders such as parenteral nutrition-associated cholesta- sis, cystic fibrosis and «-1-antitrypsin deficiency may mimic biliary atresia. Liver biopsy specimens obtained before 6 weeks of age could be indistinguishable from neonatal hep- atitis [8-10]. If left untreated, patients with biliary atresia will die within the first years of life from complications of biliary cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.
wak1 | The primary treatment for biliary atresia is the Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy, which consists of resecting the choledocal remnants, gallbladder and portal plate and construct- ing a jejunal Roux-en-Y anastomosis (Kasai procedure) or cholecystostomy to restore biliary drainage. If biliary atresia pa- tients have surgery within the first 60 days of life, bile flow can be established in 70% of cases; patients who have surgery after 90 days of life achieve sufficient bile flow only in 20% of cases [11]. Liver transplantation is performed if primary Kasai hepatoportoenteostomy fails or in case of delayed diagnosis with advanced cirrhosis that contraindicates Kasai surgery. Rapid di- agnosis at the onset of symptoms is the main goal of imaging considering the paramount importance of early surgical treatment.
wtfz | Differentiating biliary atresia from other nonsurgical causes of neonatal cholestasis is challenging. Gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase is an important biomarker in the dif- ferential diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis showing higher levels in children with biliary atresia than in those without biliary atresia [12]. Ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiopancreatography, hepatobiliary scinti- graphy, liver percutaneous biopsy, percutaneous cholecysto- cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangio- pancreatography (ERCP) are used in the work-up for biliary atresia, but surgery with intraoperative cholangiography and biopsy is the only reference standard for diagnosis.
qy1i | We divided our results in two linked papers. In part 1 [13], we discussed the prenatal US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis and the early postnatal US findings. In this second part, we discuss the role of MR cholecysto- pancreatography, nuclear medicine, percutaneous biopsy, per- cutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography and risk scores. Based on this literature review and discussions within the European Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) Abdominal Taskforce, both via e-mails and during plenary sessions, a suggested diagnostic pathway for patients with suspected bil- iary atresia is proposed as a consensus statement from the ESPR.
1k9e | Systematic review
5bjs | The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement was applied to this review. In December 2019, two of the authors (M.N. and B.M.D., both with 16 years of experience) independently and systematically
uodj | searched on PubMed all articles published from Jan. 1999 to Dec. 1, 2019. Keywords included (MRI) AND (biliary atre- sia), (percutaneous cholecystocholangiography) AND (biliary atresia), (ERCP) AND (biliary atresia), (percutanous liver bi- opsy) AND (biliary atresia), (nuclear medicine) AND (biliary atresia), (biliary atresia) AND (risk scores). The two readers in consensus selected eligible papers based on title and abstract. Only articles in English were considered for analysis. We matched author names and affiliations to avoid data duplica- tion and we included only the most recent or complete study of the same authors including the same patients. No papers were dismissed due to the children's ages or the type of study.
