Among-model variability, particularly in the early portion of the time series, is greater than the uncertainty estimated in any individual assessment, and a substantial trend of diminishing variability is not apparent. The treatment of one parameter in particular, the catchability of the acoustic survey, has changed over time. Prior to two thousand four, this value was assumed to be one, meaning that the fully selected portions of the stock, based on age or length, were fully available to the survey and that the survey covered the entire latitudinal and longitudinal distribution of Pacific hake, and, as mentioned previously, the TS relationship was correct. During two thousand four to two thousand seven, two values for the catchability coefficient were used to parameterize what were considered equally plausible alternative models. Since this time, the catchability for the acoustic survey has been freely estimated within the assessment models, which has the effect of increasing the apparent uncertainty in the assessment results, as the uncertainty in the catchability is now accounted for, rather than ignored, in the model. In reality, the assessment is more certain than before given the addition of much more and higher quality data.\nxjyk | A Management Strategy Evaluation was developed in two thousand twelve. The initial goal was to explore the performance of the current default harvest control rule and the performance of stock assessment and management with annual versus biennial\nmt0f | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\nawab | acoustic surveys. Using results from the two thousand twelve assessment, the MSE model simulated a known population forward in time under four scenarios: no fishing, catches determined from perfect knowledge of the spawning biomass, and catches predicted using simulated data with either annual or biennial surveys supplied to an assessment model with a similar setup to the two thousand twelve assessment. Preliminary results show good progress in developing an MSE with the need for additional input from industry and managers. Although the assumptions were simplistic and the results are not recommended to be used for management advice, they do suggest that the default harvest rate would result in an average female spawning biomass slightly below B forty percent, but with high variability, with median biomass near B thirty percent. Decreasing the default harvest rate towards F fifty percent would result in larger average and median biomass, median biomass near B forty percent, with little change to average long-term catch, and while reducing the inter-annual variability in catch and biomass.\nixcc | Nine point seven. Products and markets\n8p6h | In product form, Pacific hake is a white-fleshed, mild-tasting fish. The early stages of the Pacific hake fishery produced mainly fillets, headed and gutted products, and fish meal, mostly for foreign markets. Initially, there was very little market in either the United States or Canada for the catch, due to problems with rapid softening of the flesh related to the presence of the parasites in the genus Kudoa. By the early nineteen nineties, quality problems were overcome by rapid cooling techniques and enzyme inhibitors, and the development of processed Pacific hake products, such as surimi, has made the fishery more profitable.\npmgl | Development of large-scale domestic fisheries was thought infeasible throughout the nineteen eighties due to product quality concerns, cost of production and impediments to markets. Nonetheless, domestic capacity increased rapidly in the fishery. A unique problem with Pacific hake from the coastal stock is an endogenous protease produced in reaction to a muscle parasite. This parasite can cause proteolytic muscle disintegration, which can reduce the gel-forming ability of myofibrillar proteins in Pacific hake surimi. However, protease inhibitors can be added to the minced Pacific hake muscle to maintain gel-forming ability. The most effective protease inhibitors include bovine blood plasma proteins, egg white, potato-based inhibitors, or whey. In two thousand three, concerns about the use of bovine blood plasma, because of its potential relationship with 'mad cow' disease, affected certain markets for Pacific hake surimi.\n90no | Developments in food science and improved handling of Pacific hake onboard vessels and in processing plants have eliminated various impediments to production and marketability of Pacific hake. For example, use of cold temperature-based processes now allows for surimi production without the use of protease inhibitors.\njt0y | Throughout the contemporary history of the fishery, most of the catch were processed into surimi, which is used to make shellfish analogues. In about two thousand three, the hake industries in both the United States and Canada began developing highly mechanized processing facilities to handle fish as efficiently as possible and to expand the diversity of product forms. Currently, higher economic return comes from the production of non-surimi forms, such as headed and gutted products, fillets and blocks. These forms now dominate production. While Pacific hake has never been a high-value fish, the total revenue to the industry is in the tens of millions of U.S. dollars per year - over fifty million dollars per year in recent years - and the market for Pacific hake remains strong.\nqb7o | The authors thank Doug Hay and Vidar Wespestad for inspiration, Martin Dorn for his early suggestions and helpful comments on an earlier draft of this chapter, John Pohl and two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions and the multitude of the colleagues who have worked towards understanding, monitoring and assessing the coastal stock of Pacific hake over the years.\noae5 | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\ns0fl | Biology, fisheries, assessment and management of Pacific hake\n43ia | Hakes",
