As someone in this situation simultaneously wants to move towards and away from one's partner, the very foundation of their relationship and attachment system can begin to shudder, and people can begin acting out in ways that are destructive to each other and the relationship. When this happens, I recommend working with a professional to re-establish inner and outer safety.\nxbmu | CNM can activate the attachment system into primal panic.\nrp75 | From the perspective of attachment theory, we need to be connected to people to survive, so our nervous system equates emotional connection with safety and emotional disconnection with danger or threat. Attachment-related threats include the potential loss of our attachment figure, separation from our attachment figure or loss of access to them for periods of time longer than we are used to. These threats don't have to be actual to activate the attachment system-even theoretical or symbolic threats can initiate attachment distress and what is called primal panic. As Sue Johnson states,\n62hx | Separation distress arises when an attachment bond is threatened or a secure connection is lost. There are other kinds of emotional bonds based on shared activities or respect, and when they are broken a person may be distressed. But that distress does not have the same intensity or significance as when an attachment bond is called into question. Emotional and physical isolation from attachment figures is inherently traumatizing for human beings, beginning with it as a heightened sense, not simply of vulnerability and danger, but also helplessness.\nn5mv | Many of my clients report being highly anxious and off their emotional axis for hours, sometimes even days, before their partner goes on a date with someone else. Others seriously spiral out while the date is happening. Cognitively, they know that their partner is still alive, not abandoning them or doing anything wrong, but their body and emotions are in primal panic. In such cases, jealousy is not a sufficient or accurate description of what is happening for the partner in distress. When primal attachment panic gets mislabeled as jealousy, the partner experiencing it\n3lem | can be left thinking that there is something wrong with them, that this is their issue to figure out on their own and that they should be better at doing CNM. They might use self-destructive behaviors, such as using distractions or substances, in an attempt to feel better, but the root of the problem is left unaddressed. This can also escalate into panic attacks, meltdowns or an emotional crisis that can pit partners against each other or become extremely difficult for everyone involved to manage. However, when people are able to identify this experience as primal panic, understand how it is rooted in their attachment needs, learn how to better self-soothe and address these attachment needs with their partner, a new path forward opens up together.\njm94 | There can be a mismatch of attachment expectations.\nv4s7 | As mentioned earlier, not all relationships have to be attachment-based, but ideally all parties involved in the relationship need to agree about this. Very painful and confusing situations can arise when one person wants a certain relationship to meet their attachment needs, but the other person does not want the same level of involvement, or if a person wants an attachment-based relationship in theory but is practically or situationally unable to emotionally provide at that level. When I see clients struggling with attachment anxiety because a partner gives mixed signals or is inconsistent in their responsiveness, support or availability, it is important to explore whether or not they are expecting this partner to be an attachment figure for them. If they are, then it is paramount for them to dialogue with their partner about whether or not that partner wants to be in the role of an attachment figure for them, as well as honestly assessing if the partner has enough time, capacity and/or space in their life and other relationships to show up to the degree required for being polysecure together.\nj6ud | Some people prefer not to define their relationships, preferring to explore and experience them without labels or traditional expectations. As long as this level of ambiguity or relationship fluidity is a match for everyone involved, it can be a very liberating and satisfying way to relate with others. But when someone casts a partner in the role of attachment figure, but that person is unable or unwilling to play\nrlh2 | the part, much pain, frustration, disappointment, heartache and attachment anxiety ensues. In monogamy, if two people do not align in their desires to be attached at a secure level or one person is unable or unwilling to step into secure functioning, then the relationship usually ends (or they just suffer miserably together forever), but when this occurs in nonmonogamy, the relationship might also end, but it doesn't necessarily have to. Nonmonogamous relationships allow for more flexibility and negotiation about how close, connected and involved partners want to be. I've seen that once people get clear with each other about whether or not they are pursuing an attachment-based relationship, each person can better orient to what the relationship is, what it isn't, what's available and what's not available, enabling people to better accept and appreciate the relationship for what it is without having to let it go. If the relationship is not going to be attachment-based, this doesn't mean that someone no longer needs to have their attachment needs met in general, but the acceptance that a specific relationship is not going to meet a person's attachment needs can relieve everyone involved and be an important step in finding or creating relationships with others.\ngwtt | Potential signs that your attachment needs are not being considered in your CNM relationship:\ngzru | . Your partner is inconsistently there for when you need them.\n79vs | . Your partner ignores your texts, emails or calls or inconsistently responds to your texts, emails or calls.\n9bfz | · Your partner ignores your explicit requests for time together or they keep saying that they want to do things with you but there is little to no follow-through.\nlrwo | . Your partner does things that make you question if you are accepted, appreciated or valued.\nvlfw | . Your partner is inconsistent about the information they share about themselves, other partners or sexual activity.\nfg41 | . Relationship and/or sexual agreements are being broken.\nd033 | . Your partner uses their other partners as an excuse for their own behavior.\nwtvl | · Your partner uses criticism, defensiveness, contempt or stonewalling.\nu2qd | . Your feelings, needs or opinions are not heard or don't carry much weight.\n4kpx | . Despite what your partner says about how much they care about you or how they don't practice hierarchy, other partners are getting preferential treatment.\n2xnd | . Your partner is effusively affectionate over text, but uncomfortable with verbal or physical affection in person.\n8rp1 | . You are giving more than you are receiving.\n0z93 | . You are being asked to keep your relationship a secret or lie about your relationship in front of certain people.\nwe3s | . You get more information from your metamours pertaining to important things about your partner than from your actual partner.\nvuhu | CNM can create new attachment ruptures.\n```",
