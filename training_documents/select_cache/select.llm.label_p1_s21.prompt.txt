You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

r5il | A llenes constitute a distinct class of organic compounds with two orthogonal n-bonds. There are numerous natural products and bioactive molecules that contain allene substructures.13 It has been demonstrated that allene- substituted bioactive compounds, like steroids,45 prostaglan- dins,6,7 carbacyclins,7 nucleosides, and unnatural amino acids," display higher potency, increased metabolic stability, and bioavailability. Because of the strained nature of the cumulene structure, allenes have been engaged in numerous synthetic transformations as a versatile building block to form a variety of carbo- and heterocyclic frameworks.10-19 Axial-to- central chirality transfer is an efficient method for generating chiral compounds containing one or more stereogenic centers from chiral allenes.19-22
5gui | Due to the important utility of allenes, it is highly desirable to develop new synthetic methods to generate functionalized allenes from readily available starting materials.23-28 One of the traditional approaches to the synthesis of allenes involves 1,2-elimination of vinyl derivatives under strong basic or metal- catalyzed conditions.29 SN2'-type reactions with propargylic alcohol derivatives (FG-CH2-C=C)30-33 or isomerization of enyne moieties34 also constitutes an efficient method for generating allenes. Transition metal-catalyzed coupling be- tween terminal alkynes and carbonyl moieties in the presence of a secondary amine is also a well-established method,35 and a Cu(I)-catalyzed cross-coupling of terminal alkynes with diazo compounds is another efficient protocol for generating allenes.36 Trisubstituted allenes can be accessed via metal- catalyzed cationic Heck coupling of alkynes with aryl halide/ triflate.37-39 Enones and ynones are also explored as a precursor of allenes.40,41
82qc | In 2004, Fu reported a Cu(I)-catalyzed coupling of alkynes and diazoacetate under mild conditions to generate 3-alkynyl carboxylate and only small amounts of the corresponding allenoates were observed (Scheme 1A).42 On the contrary, Lee

x972 | the presence of a base such as triethyl amine, allenoate became the exclusive product.43 Fox also reported a similar reaction that selectively generated allenoate as the product.44 Although the exact mechanisms of these reactions are not well understood, on the basis of other related reactions, we propose a copper acetylide-mediated mechanism for the formation of the 3-alkynoate and allenoate. Relying on this copper acetylide- mediated mechanism, we envision that the copper-catalyzed coupling of terminal 1,3-diyne 1 and azide would generate 3- alkynyl and allenyl imidamide/imidate <LATEX>2 / 3</LATEX> (Scheme 1B). We surmise that the terminal 1,3-diyne would form the corresponding copper acetylide, which will participate in a <LATEX>\left\lceil 3 + 2 \right\rceil</LATEX> cycloaddition45 with tosylazide to form triazole IN-1. The subsequent loss of molecular nitrogen will lead to two equilibrating organocopper aza-cummulenes IN-2 and IN-3,46 which then react with a nucleophile such as an amine or alcohol to generate imidamide47 or imidate48 containing either an alkyne (2) or an allene moiety (3). A unique feature of this transformation is the selective transformation of the terminal alkyne moiety for the construction of imidamide and imidate functionality. Although starting from a different set of starting materials, the formation of closely related products from transformations in <LATEX>A</LATEX> and <LATEX>\mathrm { B }</LATEX> is noteworthy. Herein, we describe our exploration of copper-catalyzed reactions of terminal 1,3- diyne 1 with tosylazide, which generated functionalized 1,3- disubstituted 2,3-dienyl imidamides and imidates 3 with good selectivity over the corresponding alkyne derivative 2. Also, it was found that the types of nucleophiles, the base additives, and the substituent patterns of the 1,3-diynes not only affect the ratio of 2 to 3 but also promote the formation of alternative products such as [3]cumulenes and triple-bond-migrated products.
cwrw | Our exploration commenced with the assessment of the efficiency and selectivity for the formation of 3-alkynyl and allenyl imidamide 2 and 3 (Table 1). Under the conditions that include a copper catalyst (CuI, 10 mol %), an azide (1.2 equiv), and an amine (1.2 equiv), 1,3-diynes containing different substituents were examined. A hexyl-substituted terminal 1,3-diyne 1a and TsN3 provided a mixture of 3- alkynyl and allenyl imidamides 2aa and 3aa in 75% yield with a
4i0e | 2:1 ratio (entry 1). Reactions of 1a with other azides such as diphenyl phosphoryl azide49 and mesyl azide are also efficient, affording 3-alkynyl imidamide 2ab and 2ac as the major products (entries 2 and 3, respectively). On the contrary, employing piperidine as a nucleophile under otherwise identical conditions, 1a provided 2ad exclusively (entry 4). 1,3-Diynes with a secondary (1b) or tertiary alkyl group (1c) provided good yields of <LATEX>2 / 3 b a</LATEX> and <LATEX>2 / 3 c a</LATEX> but low selectivity with a slight preference for alkynyl products 2ba and 2ca (entries 5 and 6, respectively). 1-Cyclohexenyl-substituted 1,3- diyne provided <LATEX>2 / 3 d a</LATEX> in 48% yield with a preference for compound 3da. 1,3-Diyne 1e containing a propargylic hydroxyl group afforded allene derivative 3ea predominantly (entry 8), whereas 1,3-diyne 1f containing a trimethylsilyl group provided alkyne derivative 2fa selectively but in marginal yield (entry 9).
h2l3 | Once a general trend for the efficiency and selectivity between 2 and 3 had been revealed from the entries in Table 1, we next explored the selective formation of 3-alkynyl imidamide 2 (Scheme 2). As piperidine exclusively generated

u6ty | 3-alkynyl imidamide, reactions of n-decyl- and homobenzyl- substituted 1,3-diynes with piperidine were performed, resulting in the corresponding 3-alkynyl imidamides <LATEX>2 a c ^ { \prime }</LATEX> and <LATEX>2 a c ^ { \prime \prime }</LATEX> in 57% and 40% yields, respectively. Reaction with phosphoryl azide and alkyl-substituted diynes predominantly generated 3-alkynyl imidamides (2ab', <LATEX>2 a b ^ { \prime \prime } ,</LATEX> and 2bb) in moderate 45-60% yields. Electron-rich 1,3-diynes with silyl substituents selectively delivered 3-alkynyl imidamides. TES-, TIPS-, and TBS-substituted 1,3-diynes provided the corre- sponding alkynyl derivatives <LATEX>2 f a ^ { \prime } - 2 f a ^ { \prime \prime \prime }</LATEX> in 85-94% yields. Reactions of TIPS-substituted 1,3-diyne with phosphoryl and mesyl azide also generated 3-alkynyl imides 2fb" and <LATEX>2 f c ^ { \prime \prime }</LATEX> exclusively in 59% and 82% yields, respectively. It is evident from Scheme 2 that reactions with cyclic amine, phosphoryl azide, and electron-rich silyl-substituted 1,3-diynes tend to generate 3-alkynyl imidamide predominantly or exclusively.
awvu | Next, we examined reactions of different 1,3-diynes to selectively form 2,3-dienyl imidamide 3 (Scheme 3). On the basis of the initial observation with propargylic alcohol- containing diyne 1e that selectively generated 2,3-dienyl imidamide, we further tested the reactivity of structurally diversified propargyl alcohols, (thio)ethers, amines, and

The selectivity between the allenyl and alkynyl isomer depends on the substituent, but no clear trend has been found. 1,3-Diynes with a tertiary alcohol and a cycloalkyl substituent delivered 2,3-dienyl imidamides (3la, 3la', and 3la") in 70-80% yields with a roughly 10:1 selectivity. Carvone-containing 1,3-diyne afforded allene 3ma (7:1 allene:alkyne ratio) in 69% yield with a 1.4:1 diastereomeric ratio. While a vinyl-conjugated 1,3-diyne containing a free hydroxyl group provided allene 3na in 46% yield with a low selectivity (4:1), 1,3-diynes with benzyl-, 3-MeO-Ph-, and THP-protected primary alcohols exclusively generated allene derivatives (30a, 30a', and 30a", respectively) in 54-70% yields. Similarly, a cholesteryl ether-substituted 1,3-diyne generated allene 3pa in 56% yield with an 8:1 allene:alkyne ratio. On the contrary, the corresponding thioether afforded 3qa contaminated with the alkyne isomer (7.5:1 allene:alkyne). 1,3-Diynes containing aniline and tosylamido substituents at the propargylic position selectively generated allenes 3ra and 3sa in 58% and 88% yields, respectively. A gem-dimethyl, however, decreased the yield and selectivity for 3sa' (68%, 8:5:1). An indole-substituted 1,3-diyne provided only allene 3ta in 68% yield, and N-allyl tosyl-substituted 1,3-diyne provided single isomer 3ua in 67% yield. On the contrary, phenyl- and 4-MeO-phenyl-substituted 1,3-diynes provided moderate yields and selectivity provided allenes 3va (64%, 4.6:1) and 3va' (64%, 3.6:1).
bd9h | Although the selectivity of forming allenyl imidamides is good, the formation of alkyne isomer could not be suppressed in many cases. At this juncture, we surmised that trapping the ketenimine intermediate with alcohols may have different product distributions.50,51 Indeed, under identical conditions except for the replacement of i-Pr2NH (1.2 equiv) with MeOH (10 equiv) and Et3N (2 equiv), the reaction of 1,3-diynes selectively provided 2,3-dienyl imidates without a vestige of the alkyne isomer (Table 2).
