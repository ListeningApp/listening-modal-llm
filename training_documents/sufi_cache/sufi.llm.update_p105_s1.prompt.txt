You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

1638 | It is done by lodging the idea firmly in the mind with at least as much durability as the fantasies which oppose it and which masquerade as fact; we start by making sure that we have ab- sorbed the statement, and that we don't just gobble it up and ask for the next piece of attractive news.
80ko | HUMANS AS DEMONS
pzdj | Remember what Rumi said, and you will see how people chain themselves with their desires, which are not the same as their potentialities:
77kg | Humans are demons and lust is their chain It drags them to the shop and field This chain is composed of fear and anxiousness Do not see this creation as chainless: It pulls them to effort and chase It pulls them to the mines and to the sea.
tiim | Capacity comes before Opinion
3bcu | Q: Some people say they can learn through studying books, others that there isn't anything worthwhile in books, and others that they haven't found the right books yet. What are your re- actions to this sort of thing?
x18v | A: I can't do better than repeat an old story told by a Sufi. He described how at one time he looked for books and did not find them; then he found them and thought that everything was in them; then he decided that there was nothing in them. Finally, but only after going through all these phases - and phases they are -he realised which were the books useful to him, and what their use really was.
ymma | What had been wrong was his attitude of accepting or rejecting books before he himself attained the capacity to study the matter properly. He was forming opinions without first developing ordi- nary capacities further; and asking for things without being able to profit from them.
9sdd | He should have started with more common sense.
fvzf | Rumi speaks of people who rely upon the written word as sometimes being no more than donkeys laden with books. Why do people always wonder whether books are any good, without won- dering whether they are themselves in a state to profit from them?
nwiv | When I was first taught this, I was given this saying, so that by calling it to mind I could again experience the shallowness of the discussions about books, as carried out in so many circles:
lxut | 'Premature independence is the daughter of conceit.'
e5mf | If you write the question down and look at it, you will, I think (and hope) at once see that it is not a question about Sufi learning, but about books. This person is concentrating on the idea of books, not the ideas in the books.
14hq | Sanctified Greed
vmox | SUFI study is in some ways more difficult, in others easier, than other forms of study involving man's development of himself.
7w5a | It is more difficult, for instance, because many of the approaches and behaviour-patterns needed by Sufic study are not naturalised in ordinary culture: they have not been needed by societies in order to form and sustain themselves up to a certain point.
ts5q | It is easier, again, to approach many Sufi patterns because we already have the analogy of thought-patterns and behaviour- instruction being passed down by the culture for establishing and maintaining itself: the principle is there.
10rn | But sometimes the two are in conflict-or seem to be. For example, the undifferentiated desire for attention and frequent stimuli intakes in common-denominator rhythm is known to everyone. In most human cultures, especially in the cruder forms, this stimulus-intake has been harnessed to the culture's own service. It has not been analysed and divided up as, for instance, you would divide (in the case of food) appetite from nutritional requirement and again from taste, flavour, habit and greed.
eos5 | So, taking our example, people have sanctified greed-so long as it is the kind of greed prized by the society. All other kinds of greed are labelled 'bad', but acceptable greed is labelled 'good moti- vation', only too often. This diversion of greed into national, tribal and similar objectives only perpetuates addictive behaviour. People develop a taste for, say, attention; the society says: 'Yes, you may have it-all you have to do is to seek our approval by works of charity, heroism' - whatever the society in question thinks it wants or needs. Such approved works not infrequently cause in- justice to others.
0kcg | Because the victim seeks and gets stimuli, he is generally fully occupied with this, and fails to see that he is being manipulated, or that he has a compulsion. His spectrum of perception of the (in this case) acquisitive is never developed. It is as if he had a sense of touch but could not tell fine from rough, or hot from cold. He
1f32 | is correspondingly at a disadvantage in respect to people who nave a finer sense and also in respect to his and his society's possible variety, including the solution of problems.
glqs | As he has never been told that there is sensitive touch, (to continue the analogy) he cannot perceive it As he gets approval from using coarse touch, he is at the mercy of those people and institutions which lay down the rules. As he does not conceive the possibility of anything more sophisticated, he has no chance of finding it. Because it does not exist, of course, within the terms of his conventions, in his tribe. Or he may imagine the possibility, but be wrong in his choice of method of developing it.
1ded | This is, of course, the pre-rational, pre-scientific, pre-organised state. It is referred to by Sufis as the 'All Soup has Lumps in It* situation: after the tale of the yokel who wouldn't accept lumpless soup because he hadn't encountered it before, and refused to eat it.
zod3 | So he is not only coarse, he is an addict. How can he be cured?
e33h | He can be cured by experience. But first he must conceive the possibility. Next he must be exposed to it but only after he has attained 'spare capacity', time and alignment which will allow him to focus on the problem. He can never do so while the only alternatives which he is offered are simply other forms of addic- tion.
vnl2 | He must get used to the idea that he is automatised even while he is gulping the panacea called 'I am not going to be auto- matised!'
kjun | He may have to try again and again. Saadi, in his Boston, 'The Orchard' says: 'Not every oyster holds a pearl/Not every time does the archer hit the target'
u0y7 | Psychic Idiots
bs86 | Q: Is there any quick, rule-of-thumb way of telling whether a person is serious and capable of learning in the Sufi Way?
sglt | A: If there is any, it is this: serious people are prepared to start at the beginning and go a step at a time, to 'start the jour- ney of a thousand miles with one single step'; people who are not serious are looking for miracles and stimuli and 'advanced work'.
0l33 | Q: What produces, and what sustains, this unsuitability ?
8wt8 | A: Vanity, which is why most systems require humility.
5fo9 | Q: If most systems require this, why does it not work?
djty | A: Because most systems end up by making imagined humility into a form of vanity, so they end up with vanity just the same.
sm6g | You can perceive a person's aspiration if it is genuine, because this creates a change in the emanations from such a person.
ib71 | USELESS PRAYER
jmui | Omar Khayyam said:
3ygl | They went, and none returned again
fic6 | To tell you the telling of that beyond
p33e | You won't gain anything through automatic prayer
4c71 | Prayer is worthless without sincerity and true aspiration.
8yig | This second question, about unsuitability, interests me rather more than the first, about 'Quick, rule-of-thumb methods.' Has the enquirer ever asked himself what he could do with such a method?
21te | Q: But surely prayer, properly carried out, can prepare for proper learning?
