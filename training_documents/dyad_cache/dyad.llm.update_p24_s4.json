        "content": "8bwk | That Willoughby falsified intelligence in order to please MacArthur is supported by good evidence from the X Corps and the Eighth Army staff officers. Almond's deputy chief of staff, Colonel William J. McCaffrey, who had served under Almond as the chief of staff of the Ninety-second Division in World War Two, believed that Willoughby \"was more interested in staying in MacArthur's good graces than in rendering objective assessment of the available facts\" and that this was particularly the case regarding the estimate of the magnitude of the Chinese threat. Almond's G-three, Jack Chiles, remembered: \"MacArthur did not want the Chinese to enter the war in Korea. Anything MacArthur wanted, Willoughby produced intelligence for. In this case, Willoughby falsified the intelligence reports. He should have gone to jail.\" Almond's G-two, Colonel James H. Polk, wrote that \"we had the dope but old C-A-W (Willoughby) bowed to the superior wisdom of his beloved boss and didn't fight him as a good staff officer should.\"\nez9s | In the Eighth Army, the situation was more complex. While Walker was not considered by MacArthur and his inner circle as \"one of 'them,'\" his G-two, Lieutenant Colonel James Tarkenton, had been nominated for his position by Willoughby, despite his lack of combat experience, and he owed Willoughby his loyalty. But Tarkenton had done a good job in the Pusan perimeter and won Walker's trust. Nevertheless, when it came to estimating the magnitude of the Chinese threat, Tarkenton followed Willoughby's methodology and estimates. This was not an innocent mistake. The Eighth Army's G-three, Colonel John Dabney, defined Tarkenton's estimates as \"unduly influenced\" and \"colored\" by Willoughby's views. William Train, Dabney's senior planner who estimated the Chinese force as far greater than the official estimate, explained Tarkenton's motivation: \"It was MacArthur's Command, not a U.S. Army command, and if you crossed Willoughby it was not just a ticket out of there, it was probably a ticket straight out of your career.\" Train did not mince words about Willoughby's behavior: \"What he was doing in those days was fighting against the truth, trying to keep it from going from lower levels to higher ones where it would have to be acted on.\"\nmqot | The impact of the Bataan Gang mentality was not limited to intelligence estimates alone. Both Walker and Almond received the same intelligence reports, yet their effect on them was very different. Walker, an\noc99 | experienced general, considered by General Patton \"the most eager to attack,\" was aware of the lack of solid information concerning the enemy he faced. His G-two estimated it at twenty-seven thousand CPVF and twenty-three thousand KPA soldiers, altogether about fifty thousand troops. Although the Eighth Army was more than one hundred thousand strong and enjoyed superior firepower and mobility, and despite pressure from MacArthur, Walker avoided pushing his\n212\ngipz | commanders to move too fast and cautioned them of potential dangers.\nb4wj | The commander of the X Corps, as a professional U.S. Army study shows, acted differently: \"General Almond and his staff had blindly followed the guidance of the supremely optimistic Far Eastern Command, which seemed to ignore or discount sign after sign of possible massive Chinese intervention. Almond directed his units to race to the Yalu without regard to their flanks or to the location of any enemy forces.\" Whether it was Almond's personal fault or his and his staff officers' is a matter of controversy. Post factum, his chief of staff wrote that the X Corps plan was \"insane.\" Almond's deputy chief of staff explained it, \"General Almond was not about to protest an order from General MacArthur. After all, everyone said Inchon wouldn't work.\" Almond's Bataan Gang outlook made the X Corps offensive that started on November twenty-seven \"the most ill-advised and unfortunate operation of the Korean War.\" Others, who did not share Almond's\n5xlt | Almond had a reputation for being an aggressive commander but Marines commanders are known to be aggressive too and Smith was no exception. Nevertheless, he took into account the reality of the battlefield and thus saved his division from a disaster. Conspicuously, Almond's optimistic estimate did not change even after the Chinese counteroffensive had begun. On November twenty-eight, he told the officers of an isolated task force: \"The enemy who is delaying you for the moment is nothing more than remnants of Chinese divisions fleeing north. We're still attacking and we're going all the way to the Yalu. Don't let a bunch of Chinese laundrymen stop you.\" This \"Gung ho\" manner was unusual by any professional standard, but Almond was not a standard officer. He was a typical product of the Bataan Gang mentality, an officer whose \"greatest weakness as a commander in Korea was his conviction that MacArthur could do no wrong.\" In Halberstam's words, Almond \"was MacArthur's boy, the true loyalist, headstrong and arrogant, determined to make the reality of the Korean battlefield fit the dreams of the commander in the Dai Ichi [MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo].\"\n9bz4 | The Bataan Gang mentality penetrated also lower ranks. Major General John Coulter served under MacArthur in World War One, and MacArthur brought him to the Far East to command the U.S. Seventh Division in nineteen forty-eight. After taking two more positions, he returned to the U.S.A. When the war started, MacArthur brought him back to command the First Corps of the Eighth Army but actually to be his man in Walker's headquarters. Walker, who was not too impressed by Coulter's qualities as a battlefield commander, nominated him to command the IX Corps, which had only become operational in September. When the Chinese offensive of late November struck his forces, Coulter refused to grasp that a new reality thwarted MacArthur's intention to swiftly end the war. As Halberstam put it, his orders reflected \"the vast distance that by then existed between the reality on the battlefield and the illusions that existed in Tokyo.\"\nyfv2 | Important as it was, the Bataan Gang mentality was not created in a vacuum, but according to the preferences of senior officers in the FEC. The intelligence failure of late November, moreover, was ripened in an atmosphere that was created by human beings. And to fully comprehend the sources of this failure, we have to understand certain aspects of the minds of the persons most responsible for this fiasco.\npujl | Three. The individual level\n3rqe | Two prominent figures stand out in the process that led to the failure of November nineteen fifty. One is MacArthur, who inspired the Bataan Boys' mentality. He also exhibited groundless optimism concerning the magnitude of the Chinese threat and took unnecessary risks in pressuring his commanders to end the war by Christmas. The second is Willoughby, his G-two beginning nineteen forty-one and the officer most closely identified with this fiasco.\nnsi3 | MacArthur: paranoia and narcissism\nnil3 | Until his April nineteen fifty-one dismissal, the Korean War was MacArthur's war. Summarizing its first six months, Blair concluded that it had not been fought well, and that MacArthur was responsible for the main mistakes,\n68a1 | grossly underestimating the professionalism of the KPA; the inhumane piecemeal commitment of the untrained Eighth Army; the shift of X Corps after Inchon from hot pursuit to a meaningless amphibious landing at Wonsan; scandalously underestimating CCF strength and intentions; the foolish \"race\" to the Yalu in both the Eighth Army and the X Corps sectors. As a result sixty thousand American soldiers and Marines and probably five times that number of ROK soldiers were dead, wounded, or missing.",
