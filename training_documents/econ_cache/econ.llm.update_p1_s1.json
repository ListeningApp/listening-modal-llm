Despite the need for inclusive economic growth in the light of extreme inequality, the top five percent of incomes grew at about five percent per year compared to national income growth of three point seven percent per year. This divergence is striking in the post-recession period and appears to be partially driven by high growth in income from capital.\njfsr | Introduction\nu15r | The work of Thomas Piketty and others has highlighted the alarming increase in the income share of the richest one percent of people in countries ranging from the USA to India. Policymakers in South Africa have long sought to promote inclusive growth to address unemployment, economic inequality, poverty, and economic exclusion. This article reports new findings on income inequality, in particular the incomes of those at the very top of the income distribution - something not possible before.\nlq35 | Measuring income equality: new data\n3g9w | Regarding research on the highest incomes, Milanovic notes that household surveys, which for decades were the bread and butter of economists working on inequality, were shown wanting as they failed to fully capture this new phenomenon: the ineluctable rise of the top and the stagnation of everybody else. South Africa is no exception. Despite ample empirical evidence that South Africa has one of the most unequal income distributions in the world, the conventional use of household survey data - such as StatsSA's Living Conditions Survey, or the NIDS, the National Income Dynamics Study, collected by SALDRU on behalf of\nd09o | the Department of Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation - provide an incomplete picture of the incomes of the top groups of income earners. This is for three reasons. One: being very rich is rare, so sample surveys will not necessarily select the very rich. Two: the very rich are less likely than others to participate in household surveys. Three: the very rich may be reticent to reveal the true extent of their incomes.\nylhz | Tax information captures reported earnings and all kinds of income of taxpayers up to the highest level much more accurately. Therefore, tax data provide a much better view of the distribution of income at higher levels of income in particular. In addition to publicly available annual tax tables released by SARS, we use confidential, anonymized, assessed tax records to estimate the level and growth of the incomes of the richest in South Africa. These records were made available on a confidential basis to selected researchers in the REDI three by three project.\na3td | Here we do not consider the Gini coefficient, which is a measure of inequality in the overall income distribution. Rather, we focus on income shares in order to show the relative position of the top end of the income distribution. All calculations are in terms of real income in twenty sixteen, i.e., adjusted for inflation.\nex5k | Top incomes have diverged from the rest...\n9d4o | If, for example, one cuts this down to the top one percent, who have incomes of about seven hundred eighty thousand rand and higher, we see that their share of GNI is twelve point six percent. The richest zero point zero one percent of people, about three thousand five hundred people, had an annual income of over seven million rand each; their combined share of GNI was one point two percent, which is over a hundred times their share of the population. The relatively large income shares of such small percentages of the total adult population capture, in stark terms, the extent of income inequality.\ncjq2 | A second issue concerns how this inequality has changed in the past decade or so. The annual income growth rates for the entire period from two thousand three to twenty sixteen are shown in the last column of Table one. For all the top percentiles, the growth rate of income was around five percent per year. In comparison, the annual growth rate of Gross National Income for the same period was about three point seven percent. Thus the top income groups' income growth was significantly higher than the national average.\n5esx | ... notably in a recent period of low economic growth.\nm5ka | Additional insight is gained when one differentiates between the period two thousand three to two thousand seven, up to the recession of two thousand eight to zero nine, and the period after the recession, i.e., twenty ten to twenty sixteen.\nbyu8 | How does the income growth of the top earners compare with that of the rest of the people?\n76b0 | We use StatsSA's quarterly labour-force survey data from the Post-Apartheid Labour Market Series twenty seventeen to estimate the income growth rates for the rest of the adult population. We cannot use tax data for the entire distribution since only individuals above the filing threshold of three hundred fifty thousand rand are obliged to submit a tax return. Figure two shows a combined graph with growth rates from both survey and tax data, for the period two thousand three to twenty fifteen. The solid line shows the average growth rate of GNI over the period. About sixty percent of adults have remained on zero labour-market income. The lowest incomes grew substantially, driven by gains off a low base. For example, the sixtieth percentile earned about four hundred rand per month in two thousand three, followed by growth at an annual rate of six percent. The bulk of incomes across the distribution saw a change of between one percent and two percent only, compared to the top end of the distribution which have income growth rates of about five percent, as noted above.\nzxz6 | As a result, over the twelve years, the median income from working in the labour market grew by only twenty percent while the top one percent of income doubled. This seems to indicate that economic growth in South Africa in the period two thousand three to twenty fifteen has not been inclusive.\nxnth | Who are the winners and losers of this growth pattern? First, the survey data show that those with the lowest income growth, at the bottom of the U-shape, i.e., the seventy-fifth to ninetieth percentiles, were earning between three thousand three hundred fifty rand and ten thousand eight hundred rand per month in twenty fourteen. Secondly, whites are significantly over-represented in the fast-growing top percentiles, making up forty-three percent of the richest five percent of adults compared to eight percent of the full population.\nvafm | The income profile of those at the top of the distribution of income.\n2zmw | Using confidential tax data from SARS, we can uncover the composition of the top incomes. Figure three shows the average amounts from income sources by percentile in twenty fourteen.\nbf9k | The first two bars show that until the ninety-ninth percentile, salaries and bonuses comprise over eighty percent of income for earners. For the top one percent, income from salaries and bonuses still make up fifty percent of all income, but income from shares, profit, and capital gains contributes relatively more - and increasingly so for the top zero point one percent and zero point zero one percent.\notkr | To what extent is top income growth due to the newly rich?\nibgs | The tax data analyzed so far cover the incomes of all taxpayers in each tax year. This group changes over time as new income earners start paying tax and others stop, for example, due to death. Thus the data do not show how the income of particular individuals grew. However, the public tax tables from SARS provide some information on a selected panel of the same taxpayers over time that were tracked from two thousand five to twenty fourteen.\n```",
