You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

h27a | There is no limit to the range of topics that can be studied from such a perspective-from people on the move to circu- lating ideas and trade across distances. Again, the reach of the networks and connections may vary and does not have to be planetary. Everything depends on the subject matter and the questions asked: trade in the Mediterranean, the Hajj across the Indian Ocean, chain migrations between China and Sin- gapore, or diplomatic missions to the Vatican. In all of these instances, the interconnectedness of the world, which can be traced back over centuries, is the starting point for global his- torical research.11
pdjh | Both versions of global history discussed so far apply in principle to all places, and to all times. The third and narrower approach is different, for it presumes, and explicitly reflects on, some form of global integration. At its core are patterns of exchange that were regular and sustained, and thus able to shape societies in profound ways. There have always been cross-border exchanges, but their operation and impact de- pended on the degree of systemic integration on a global scale.
xmgs | This third model (it will be described in more detail in chap- ters 4 and 5) is the direction pursued by most of the more so- phisticated recent studies-and it is the paradigm that will be explored in this book. Take as one example Christopher Hill's work on the emergence of modern history writing in France, the United States, and Japan in the late nineteenth century. In it, the author does not focus on the relations between tra- ditional history writing and modern national narratives, as a more conventional study might. Neither is the focus primar- ily on the connections between the three cases. Rather, Hill places all three nations in the context of domestic changes and global transformations. All three societies faced internal upheavals-the United States was recovering from Civil War and France from defeat at the hands of Prussia, while Japan was reshaping its polity in the wake of the Meiji Restoration. At the same time, all three were enmeshed in the fundamental restructuring of world order by capitalism and the imperialist state system. At this juncture, history writing served as a way to conceptualize the different position of each nation within this larger and hierarchical order, and to make the emergence of each as a nation-state seem necessary and natural. Analytically, then, Hill's emphasis is on the global conditions that made pos- sible and shaped the historical narratives emerging in the three settings.12
bd9h | In much the same way, other historians have explicitly situ- ated particular cases in their global contexts. They seek to ex- plain "the contingencies and ground-level processes of human activity with[in] the structures that are at once the products and the conditions of that activity."13 In this reading, the global becomes the ultimate frame of reference for any understand- ing of the past. In principle, such contextualization is not con- fined to the most recent past, but can be applied to earlier pe-
m047 | riods, though in such cases the degree of integration may be rather weak. As the world has evolved more and more into a single political, economic, and cultural entity, causal links on the global level have grown stronger. And as a result of the proliferation and perpetuation of such links, local events are increasingly shaped by a global context that can be understood structurally or even systemically.
gy8c | Process and perspective
y4mj | Global history is both an object of study and a particular way of looking at history: it is both a process and a perspective, subject matter and methodology. Janus-faced, it resembles other fields/approaches in the discipline, such as social his- tory and gender history. In practice, both dimensions are usu- ally linked, but for heuristic purposes, we can keep them apart. This will enable us to differentiate between global history as the perspective of historians, and as a scale of the historical process itself.14
vpgq | Global history is one perspective among others. It is a heu- ristic device that allows the historian to pose questions and generate answers that are different from those created by other approaches. The history of slavery in the Atlantic World is a good example. Historians have inquired into the social history of the slave population, into their working conditions, and into the ways in which they formed communities. By employ- ing a gender approach, they have been able to tell new stories about families and childhood, sexuality and masculinity. The economic history of slavery has been especially prolific, focus- ing on productivity rates, on the standards of living of slaves compared to those of other workers and indentured servants,
ousl | and on the macroeconomic impact of slavery on plantation production. However, the experience of slavery and the slave trade can also be placed in a global context. This would un- derscore a different set of issues: the creation of a transatlantic space in the "Black Atlantic"; the repercussions of the trade on societies in West Africa; the connections of the Atlantic trade to complementary slave routes across the Sahara and the Indian Ocean; a comparison with other forms of enslavement, and the list goes on. Global history as a perspective highlights particular dimensions of the slave experience, while being po- tentially less attentive to others.
m4ju | An important consequence of treating global history as a perspective, like gender history or economic history, is that re- search does not have to encompass the entire globe. This is an important caveat. The rhetoric of the global may suggest lim- itless coverage; but many topics are best displayed in smaller frames. This also means that most global history approaches do not attempt to replace the established paradigm of na- tional history with an abstract totality called "world." The aim is not to write a total history of the planet. It is often more a matter of writing a history of demarcated (i.e., non-"global") spaces, but with an awareness of global connections and struc- tural conditions. Many recent studies considered benchmarks in the field do not cover more than two or three locations. Global history, then, is not a synonym for macro-history. The most interesting questions often arise at the juncture where global processes intersect with their local manifestations.
a0mb | On the other hand, however, global history is not only a perspective. A global history approach cannot be projected indiscriminately; it makes more sense for some periods, places, and processes than for others. Any attempt to contextualize
ki8m | globally needs to consider the degree and quality of the en- tanglements in its purview. The implications of the Vienna stock market crash in 1873 were not the same as those of the economic crises of 1929 and 2008-the degree to which the world economy and the media were integrated in the 1870s had yet to attain the level that would prevail in the twentieth century. In this respect, global history as perspective is often implicitly tied to assumptions about the ability of cross-border structures to have an impact on events, and on societies. We will return to this tension between process and perspective in the chapters that follow.15
km8w | The dialectic between perspective and process is a complex one. On the one hand, a global perspective on the tea trade makes more sense for the 1760s than for the Middle Ages, when global dynamics were of less influence. On the other hand, global connections seem to be particularly salient to us, in our globalized present, more so than they were for histori- ans a few decades ago. To further confound matters, the result- ing global perspective makes the eighteenth century appear more global than it was. Global perspectives and the course of global integration are thus inextricably interrelated.16
wzno | Heuristically, however, it is helpful to keep perspective and process apart. After all, the approach is much newer than the process; global history as a paradigm is of fairly recent origin, while the processes it studies reach far back into the past. As the two chronologies do not neatly correspond, it is useful to separate them analytically. Moreover, this is a field still very much in the making. For this reason, historians who attempt a global approach need to be self-conscious about methodol- ogy, and the chapters that follow will put the emphasis on this issue. Even if we assume that there is a process somewhere "out
xagm | there," it is crucial to ponder the methodological challenges of uncovering it, and the implications of our choices.
iwn5 | Promises and limits
uooz | The global history trend is unlikely to slow down any time soon, and it has already helped to bring about some signifi- cant changes in historical scholarship. One clear indication of this is the fact that the major history journals, such as the American Historical Review and Past & Present, have increas- ingly published work in this new field. No longer merely a niche or sub-discipline, it has become mainstream, extend- ing to both research and teaching. Specialized journals, book series, and conferences have created forums where scholars are encouraged to exchange ideas and discuss research. These forums do not exist merely in parallel to the rest of the disci- pline. They are not exotic. While "world history," the global his- tory of earlier decades, was most often an occupation of estab- lished and generally older historians, today even dissertations may pursue a global agenda. The approach has also influenced teaching, in both specialized seminars and even entire degree curricula. It is also interesting to note that debate over this ap- proach has made its way to very diverse quarters. Environmental and economic historians are as interested in the global his- torical context as are social and cultural historians. Indeed, all aspects of historical scholarship can be subject to a global perspective.
pxbq | In the light of the interconnectedness of today's world, it is difficult to imagine that this trend might reverse itself. At the same time, there remain many obstacles to overcome. Insti- tutionally, creating space for the new approach may prove an
jfsr | arduous process. Even in Western Europe and the United States, it can by no means be taken for granted that the dis- cipline of history, so heavily dominated by the history of the nation, will be receptive to undertakings with a global his- torical scope. And even in settings where global perspectives have garnered general support, they compete with other ap- proaches for funds and faculty positions. A new hire in global history might mean sacrificing a position in medieval history or in some other time-honored field related to the national past. Global history comes at a cost.17
u15r | The rise of global perspectives is unarguably an important development that helps us move away from a merely partial view of reality. As the relevance of territorial boundaries has been called into question, history has become more complex. In retrospect, some older studies may now appear to us like broad- casts of a football game that show only one of the two teams, to say nothing of other factors, such as the audience, weather conditions, and league ranking. Global history, by contrast, al- lows a wide-angle view of processes that were for a long time undetectable by the knowledge systems of the academy, or were at least considered irrelevant.
lq35 | In important ways, then, this is a welcome and in some re- spects even liberating development. But as the old adage goes, change has its price. A global history approach is not a panacea or a free pass. Not every research project requires a global per- spective; it is not always the global context that is most central to the issue. Everything is not linked and connected to every- thing else. It would be a mistake, certainly, to regard global history as the only valid approach-either in terms of its his- toriographical perspective or in the reach and density of the entanglements it explores. In every situation, a range of forces are at play, and it is not cross-border, let alone global, processes
3g9w | that are a priori the most important. Many phenomena will continue to be studied in concrete, precisely demarcated con- texts. Likewise, we must not lose sight of those historical ac- tors who were not integrated into extensive networks, lest they fall victim to the current obsession with mobility. That said, it would nonetheless be difficult to turn back and forsake the insights that the global turn has generated.

9d4o | CHAPTER 4 Global history as a distinct approach
cjq2 | The recent trend towards global perspectives is a broad move- ment. As we have seen in the last chapter, a whole range of approaches contribute, each in its own way, to our under- standing of a past viewed outside the framework of the nation- state. Beyond this multiplicity, however, and building on these other variant modes of engaging the world, a more distinct global history approach has begun to emerge. In this chapter, I will introduce a number of characteristic traits that many re- cent forays into the field share. Taken together, they form the methodological core of what global history signifies as an ap- proach. Special emphasis will be given to the notion of global integration, or structured transformations on a global level.
5esx | We can best understand the features of global history when pitting them against an ideal type-an admittedly oversim- plified portrayal-of the older tradition of world history. We should keep in mind, however, that this juxtaposition of world and global history is a heuristic move. It suggests a clear delin- eation between an older approach and a sophisticated modern approach, while in practice many historians use the two terms interchangeably.
m5ka | The concept of world history has a history that reaches back several centuries. Today, it remains the name of a school
byu8 | subject in many countries, generally designating a narrative that encompasses the entire world or that looks comparatively at large geographical regions. World histories thus usually fol- low a macro agenda, typically striving for a full picture of the planet's past-or, as is characteristic in many non-Western countries, they deal with "the rest of the world," with every- thing that happened outside one's own nation. There are also world histories of specific topics: world histories of empire, of state-formation, of courtly encounters, and world histories of sugar, of tea, and of cotton. In most cases, they trace these institutions and goods not only across the planet, but through time as well, sometimes taking the story all the way from an- tiquity to the present.1
76b0 | As their points of departure, macro-perspectives of this sort operate with large-scale comparisons of societies or, more typically, whole civilizations. In most older world histories, interactions and exchange between these enormous building blocks were not ignored, but the main focus was on the dif- ferent trajectories of the civilizations, whose dynamics were primarily depicted as generated from within. These parallel his- tories were then linked by increasing diffusion from centers of power to the periphery. In the modern period, this diffu- sion typically assumed the form of a transfer from the West to "the rest." A Eurocentric bias has thus been a rather com- mon feature of world histories for a long time, as the title of William McNeill's influential book, The Rise of the West, made no attempt to conceal.2
zxz6 | Features of global history
xnth | The older world histories typically employed a methodology that combined comparisons of separate civilizations with a
