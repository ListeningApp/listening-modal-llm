Knowledge of how particulate methane monooxygenase selectively oxidizes methane under ambient conditions could impact the development of new catalysts. The crystal structure of Methylococcus capsulatus particulate methane monooxygenase reveals the composition and location of three metal centers. Spectroscopic data provide insight into the coordination environments and oxidation states of these metal centers. These results, combined with computational studies and comparisons to relevant systems, are discussed in the context of identifying the most likely site for oxygen activation.\n5vqw | Introduction\nmeyw | The oxidation of methane to methanol is a challenging reaction because methane is the most inert hydrocarbon (one hundred four kilocalories per mole C-H bond) and because methanol reacts further at high temperatures. In nature, methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane to methanol in the first step of their metabolic pathway. Methane hydroxylation is carried out at ambient temperature by methane monooxygenase enzymes. There are two forms of methane monooxygenase enzymes. All methanotrophs except members of the Methylocella genus produce an integral membrane methane monooxygenase called particulate methane monooxygenase. Several strains also express a cytoplasmic form called soluble methane monooxygenase. In organisms that possess both forms, including Methylococcus capsulatus and Methylosinus trichosporium, differential expression is regulated by the bioavailable copper concentration. Both methane monooxygenase enzymes are metalloenzymes, but that is the extent of their similarity. The two systems differ in molecular structure, metal ion composition, and substrate specificity.\n2e62 | Whereas particulate methane monooxygenase is more selective toward alkanes and alkenes that are five carbons or less, substrates for soluble methane monooxygenase include alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and halogenated hydrocarbons.\n75y3 | Activation of oxygen by soluble methane monooxygenase and related enzymes has been investigated extensively. In contrast, the metal content, organization, and location of the active site in particulate methane monooxygenase have been and continue to be controversial. It is only recently that enough information on particulate methane monooxygenase has been obtained to begin thinking about oxygen activation chemistry. In the past five years, there have been significant advances in the biochemical, spectroscopic, structural, and mechanistic characterization of particulate methane monooxygenase. In this Account, we highlight recent discoveries, with an emphasis on their relevance to oxygen activation chemistry.\ns2g2 | Overall Architecture of particulate methane monooxygenase\nq1q2 | The two point eight angstrom resolution crystal structure of Methylococcus capsulatus particulate methane monooxygenase revealed its overall architecture for the first time. Particulate methane monooxygenase consists of three subunits, pmoA, pmoB, and pmoC, with molecular masses of approximately twenty-four, forty-seven, and twenty-two kilodaltons, respectively. The three subunits assemble into a cylindrical trimeric structure that is approximately one hundred five angstroms in height and approximately ninety angstroms in diameter. The pmoA and pmoC subunits comprise the bulk of the membrane-spanning regions and are composed of seven and five transmembrane helices, respectively. In contrast, pmoB includes two distinct cupredoxin-like beta barrels linked by two transmembrane helices and a long loop region. The beta barrels from pmoB form a soluble domain that houses two of the three metal centers identified in each protomer in the crystal structure.\ncb7r | In addition to the crystal structure, Dalton and co-workers determined the structure of Methylococcus capsulatus particulate methane monooxygenase by electron microscopy. Although the twenty-three angstrom resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure limits detailed comparisons with the crystallographic data, two observations are particularly significant. First, the electron microscopy structure represents an active complex and agrees well with the overall oligomeric state and architecture of the subunits in the crystal structure. Thus, the crystal structure of particulate methane monooxygenase is physiologically relevant. Second, the identification of side \"holes\" in the soluble regions near the membrane interface are hypothesized to serve as entry points for hydrophobic substrates. A central cavity, present in both X-ray and electron microscopy structures, may function in product egress. Recent cryo-electron microscopy studies suggest that the particulate methane monooxygenase trimer forms a larger assembly with methanol dehydrogenase, the subsequent enzyme in the methanotroph metabolic pathway. In the complex, methanol dehydrogenase is proposed to interact with the soluble beta-barrel regions of pmoB.\n68xu | Particulate methane monooxygenase Metal Centers\nhd35 | Metal Ion Composition. Early analyses of the particulate methane monooxygenase metal content suggested that copper is the primary metal involved in methane oxidation. Different groups have reported copper stoichiometries for purified Methylococcus capsulatus particulate methane monooxygenase of two, two to three, eight to ten, and fifteen to twenty copper ions per one hundred kilodalton protomer. Purified particulate methane monooxygenase from Methylosinus trichosporium contains two copper ions per one hundred kilodalton. Iron is generally also present with reported stoichiometries of zero point seven five to two point five ions per one hundred kilodalton. The varying metal ion content highlights the difficulty in\n2zpk | the isolation and purification of particulate methane monooxygenase. The discovery of methanobactin, a siderophore-like, copper-binding molecule associated with some preparations, resolves some of the discrepancies, however. The DiSpirito preparation containing eight to ten copper ions actually includes six to eight molecules of methanobactin and two copper ions and is thus consistent with values obtained by us and the Dalton group. Most but not all iron-containing particulate methane monooxygenase preparations exhibit spectroscopic features characteristic of heme, suggesting that the iron derives from contaminants in the membrane fractions.\nepu7 | Spectroscopic Data. Both membrane-bound and purified particulate methane monooxygenase have been studied extensively by spectroscopic techniques. Prior to the crystal structure, these data were used to suggest models for the metal centers. At this point, we are trying to reconcile these data with the crystal structure to assess the physiological relevance of the structure and to glean more detailed information on the metal coordination environments and oxidation states. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy has been widely used to investigate particulate methane monooxygenase. Chan and co-workers report a broad isotropic signal at g approximately two point one, which was proposed to derive from a ferromagnetically coupled trinuclear copper cluster. Because no trinuclear copper center is present in the structure, alternative interpretations for this signal, such as methanobactin, superposition of a radical signal with a type two copper signal, copper ferricyanide, or adventitiously bound copper ions, might be more reasonable. All researchers observe a type\n7od1 | two copper signal for both membrane-bound and purified particulate methane monooxygenase. This signal accounts for forty to fifty percent of the total copper present, disappears upon chemical reduction, and is not altered by the addition of azide or cyanide.\n```",
