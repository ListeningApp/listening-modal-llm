It includes using the guiding principles of IRM in combination with prominent systems theories to gain the collaboration of partners, parents, other family, and friends to serve the goals of therapy. It also involves understanding the structure, process, and interpersonal dynamics of group therapy.\nyply | Another fundamental skill involves knowing how to work collaboratively with supervisors, employers, and other professionals. It involves knowing how to communicate with other professionals about clients both in the presence and in the absence of those clients. Additionally, it requires understanding the power dynamics and value systems that underlie supervisor and student, as well as employer and employee, relationships. Understanding and managing clients' difficult behavior is another category of necessary interpersonal skills required in many practice situations. It involves knowing how to respond effectively to behaviors that involve manipulation, excessive dependence, symptom focusing, resistance, emotional disengagement, denial, difficulty with rapport and trust, and hostility. Responding effectively helps limit the extent to which this behavior disrupts the goals and processes of therapy.\n75n5 | Knowing how to resolve conflicts and empathic breaks (or rifts in understanding between client and therapist) is another fundamental skill set that can salvage a failing relationship or repair minor threats to an otherwise functional relationship. Professional behavior and ethics encompass knowledge of how your own values are consistent or inconsistent with the occupational therapy core values, ethical behavior and decision-making, behavioral self-awareness around clients, being reliable and dependable, upholding confidentiality, and setting and managing professional boundaries. Therapist self-care incorporates knowing and managing your own emotional reactions to clients and being accountable to those reactions, a general capacity for self-reflection, an ability to manage your personal life and seek support when necessary, and the capacity to maintain perspective regarding client outcomes. More information about all these skills, which comprise a therapist's interpersonal skill base, is provided in Chapters eight through sixteen.\nec91 | Therapeutic Mode Use\nwul6 | The second interpersonal capacity that a therapist brings to the client-therapist relationship is her or his primary therapeutic mode or modes. A therapeutic mode is a specific way of relating to a client. The IRM identifies six\n4rhy | encouraging, instructing, and problem-solving. Therapists naturally use therapeutic modes that are consistent with their fundamental interpersonal characteristics. For example, a therapist who tends to be more of a listener than a talker in everyday life and believes in the importance of understanding another person's perspective before making a suggestion would likely utilize empathizing as a primary therapeutic mode in therapy. Therapists vary widely in terms of the range and flexibility with which they use modes in relating to clients. Some therapists relate to clients in one or two primary ways, whereas others draw upon multiple therapeutic modes depending on the interpersonal characteristics of the client and the situation at hand.\n092d | One of the goals in using the IRM is to become increasingly comfortable utilizing any of six of the modes flexibly and interchangeably depending on the client's needs. A therapeutic mode or set of modes define the therapist's general interpersonal style when interacting with a client. Therapists able to utilize all six of the modes flexibly and comfortably and to match those modes to the client and the situation are described as having a multimodal interpersonal style.\n94ul | Chapter three A Model of the Intentional Relationship sixty-five\n0vdu | should depend largely on the enduring interpersonal characteristics of the client. In addition, certain events or interpersonal events in therapy may call for a mode shift. A mode shift is a conscious change in one's way of relating to a client. Mode shifts are frequently required in response to interpersonal events in therapy. For example, if a client perceives a therapist's attempts at problem-solving to be insensitive or off the mark, a therapist would be wise to switch from the problem-solving mode to an empathizing mode so he or she can better understand the client's reaction and the root of the dilemma. An interpersonal reasoning process, described in the paragraph that follows, can be utilized to guide the therapist in deciding when a mode shift might be required and determining which alternative mode to select. Because the interpersonal aspects of occupational therapy practice are complex and require a therapist to have a highly adaptive therapeutic persona, the IRM recommends that therapists learn to draw upon all six of the therapeutic modes in a flexible manner according to the interpersonal needs of each client and the unique demands of each clinical situation.\na230 | In addition to the practical application seen in the\ndvoe | sixty-six Part one Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Practice\n677t | of how Jane Melton used each mode in practice are presented in Table three point three. According to the IRM, the six modes are a central aspect of the therapist's skill set, and they are defined and elaborated on in more detail in Chapter four.\n5hk6 | Interpersonal Reasoning\nviei | The third therapist interpersonal competence involves the capacity to engage in an interpersonal reasoning process when an interpersonal dilemma presents itself in therapy. Interpersonal reasoning is a stepwise process by which a therapist decides what to say, do, or express in reaction to the occurrence of an interpersonal dilemma in therapy. It includes developing a mental vigilance toward the interpersonal aspects of therapy in anticipation that a dilemma might occur and a means of reviewing and evaluating options for responding. A full description of the steps of interpersonal reasoning and examples of its application in practice are provided in Chapter seven.\nrk0j | Desired Occupation\nc6x9 | PRACTICAL APPLICATION three point five\ng5at | In the case example at the beginning of this chapter, Rigel uses four of the six modes effectively to resolve the earlier rift with Mr. Johnson that occurred in Chapter one. He begins the session by remaining in the empathizing mode for a long period of time. He orients his body toward the client in a way that is not threatening, admits that he was not very useful to the client in the previous session, and openly tells the client on multiple occasions that he wants to better understand why he thinks and feels the way that he does. Additionally, Rigel shifts briefly into the collaborating mode early in the session when he suggests to Mr. Johnson that he will observe him doing \"anything he wants.\" There is also a brief moment in which Rigel shifts to the advocating mode in order to normalize Mr. Johnson's feelings of demoralization and doubt. After a substantial amount of time is spent asking Mr. Johnson deepening questions and summarizing his understanding, Rigel shifts into the instructing mode in order to educate Mr. Johnson about the effects of neurorehabilitation efforts on stroke recovery.\nre3j | In summary, Rigel used interpersonal reasoning to make multiple mode shifts during the interaction that effectively promoted a more truthful and trusting communication with Mr. Johnson.\n6z45 | engagement. The desired occupation is the task or activity the therapist and client have selected for therapy. Desired occupations may include a wide range of tasks and activities, such as dressing oneself, driving, shopping, gross motor play, participating in a goal-setting group, completing a craft activity, or engaging in a simulated or modified work task. The selection of the occupation and support for occupational engagement is primarily informed by other occupational therapy conceptual practice models such as the Biomechanical Model, the Sensory Integration Model, or the Model of Human Occupation.\n20af | The primary function of IRM is to enable the therapist to manage the interpersonal dynamic between the client and the therapist that also occurs as part of the therapy process. This interpersonal dynamic influences the occupational engagement and also serves as an arena in which the emotional\nhuae | Problem-solving\nrblh | Chapter three A Model of the Intentional Relationship sixty-seven\ngl5i | sixty-eight Part one Theoretical Foundations and Guidelines for Practice\nx0yg | reactions that stem from or influence occupational engagement can be positively managed.
