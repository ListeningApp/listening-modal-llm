Although it has long been held that the primary function of the eosinophil is protection against helminth parasites, there are little data to prove this unequivocally. Moreover, eosinophils are responsible for a considerable amount of inflammatory pathology accompanying helminth infections. This article will provide an overview of our current knowledge about eosinophils and their role, both protective and pathogenic, in parasitic helminth infections.\n2zpk | Parasitic infections are caused by unicellular protozoa or multicellular helminths, the extraordinary worldwide prevalence of which exacts a major medical and economic burden. Each parasite has an exceedingly diverse and unique biology. Protozoa are usually a few micrometers in size, whereas helminths are typically centimeters to meters in length. Tissue-dwelling protozoa are often intracellular parasites at some stage of infection, whereas helminths, being larger than most tissue cells, are almost always extracellular pathogens, with the significant exception being Trichinella spiralis. Although protozoa usually replicate during infection of a single host, helminths do not reproduce without the passage through either intermediate hosts or through soil or water.\nepu7 | Helminths have many developmental stages present during infection. In the course of a single infection, the host might be repeatedly exposed to larval-, adult-, or egg-stage antigens. For example, free-swimming cercariae of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni penetrate the skin of human subjects immersed in infested water and evolve into tissue-stage schistosomula that migrate to the liver and mesenteric veins for further differentiation into sexually dimorphic adult worms. Eggs are laid that migrate through tissues into the lumen of the bowel or\n7od1 | bladder for environmental release. Similarly, filarial infection involves repeated exposure to arthropod-borne infective larvae and parasitization by long-lived adult worms capable of continuously releasing microfilariae that circulate in the bloodstream or migrate through subcutaneous tissues.\n0bqy | Because each stage of parasite development can be antigenically distinct, the host response to helminth infection is often characterized by a series of discrete immune responses that evolve at different times during the course of infection. Protective immunity directed against a single stage might be circumvented by parasite differentiation, assisting in the survival of the pathogen and posing a significant challenge to immune-mediated resistance. Each stage of parasite development might also entail a change in tissue trophism, introducing a compartmental feature to immune or inflammatory responses. For example, a variety of distinct cutaneous, pulmonary, and intestinal inflammatory or hypereosinophilic syndromes are associated with different stages of Ascaris and Strongyloides species as they migrate through the skin and lung before reaching adulthood in the gastrointestinal tract.\nb780 | Because complex parasitic life cycles can only be maintained by sequential passage through intermediate and definitive hosts, parasites have adapted methods of optimizing transmission by prolonging infection. Perhaps because of this evolutionary pressure, chronicity, latency, or both are hallmarks of helminth infections. For example, adult schistosomes and filariae can survive in host tissues for as long as twenty to thirty years, continuously producing eggs and larvae. Strongyloides species, because of their ability to \"autoinfect,\" maintain their life cycle for decades. Chronicity might also reflect pressure toward \"true parasitism\" in that inducing mortality in the host would disrupt parasite transmission if the host were to die before egg laying or larval release could occur. Adaptations for chronicity can be so successful among parasites that naturally acquired protective immunity is only observed rarely in areas endemic for a given disease. Specifically, schistosomiasis results in an incomplete form of protection in which reinfection is limited but adult worms are tolerated for years (concomitant immunity).\nccmb | Whereas pathology and protective immunity to most protozoa are believed to reflect T cell-, B cell-, and macrophage-dependent (or perhaps cytokine-mediated) mechanisms, infection with helminth parasites induces immune effector responses that are characterized by IgE\nma93 | antibody production, tissue and peripheral blood eosinophilia, and the participation of inflammatory mediator-rich tissue mast cells, qualitatively not unlike that seen in atopic diseases. For the atopic state, these responses have clearly been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. In parasitic infection, although these types of responses can certainly induce pathologic reactions, they have also been implicated in mediating protective immunity to the helminth parasites.\nc6hh | GENERAL FEATURES OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO HELMINTHS\ny7ea | Whereas the cytokine response to helminth infection is clearly more complex than initially appreciated, the eosinophilia and increased serum IgE levels characteristic of helminth infection are associated with the production of IL-4 and IL-5. The critical role of IL-5 in this eosinophilic response has been clearly demonstrated in animal models, including transgenic and knockout mice infected with a wide variety of intestinal and tissue helminths. Whereas IL-5 alone is sufficient to cause helminth infection-mediated eosinophilia and eosinophil activation in most instances, a number of other cytokines (e.g., IL-4 and IL-13) and chemokines (e.g., RANTES and eotaxin) appear to be necessary for the recruitment of eosinophils to the tissues.\nnav4 | A number of transcription factors involved in the regulation of IL-5 gene expression, including nuclear factor IL-6, NF-AT, and GATA-Three, have been recently identified. At least one of these, GATA-Three, appears to play a direct role in helminth-induced eosinophilia, as demonstrated by enhanced IL-5 production and eosinophilia in GATA-Three-transgenic mice infected with Heligosomoides polygyrus, but not in uninfected GATA-Three-transgenic control mice. The role of other transcription factors in the eosinophilia of helminth infection remains to be explored.\ngem8 | Eosinophils in the blood and tissues of helminth-infected patients and experimental animals exhibit morphologic and functional changes associated with eosinophil activation in vitro. These include decreased density, upregulation of surface activation molecules (e.g., CD-Sixty-nine, CD-Twenty-five, CD-Forty-four, and HLA-DR), enhanced cellular cytotoxicity, and release of granule proteins, cytokines, leukotrienes, and other mediators of inflammation.\ne8nr | The kinetics of eosinophilia after infection with any parasitic infection have been difficult to define because the time of initial infection can be defined only rarely. However, information from both single-source outbreaks and experimental human infection has shed light on the initiation of eosinophilia and its natural regulation. In a study of five volunteers infected with the hookworm Necatur americanus, it was shown that blood eosinophil counts increased from baseline between two and three weeks after infection and peaked between weeks seven and nine. This increase was accompanied by a parallel increase in total leukocyte counts. In those exposed to lymphatic filariae, peak eosinophil levels occur eleven to\nk78w | feature articles\ng9du | Reviews and",
