Impact of insulin resistance on learning and motivation\nxb13 | As observed in rodent studies, the effects of insulin resistance on brain dopamine signalling are not limited to food intake behaviour. Lower beta-cell function and lower insulin sensitivity were related to increased delayed reward discounting indicating more impulsive choices preferring a small, immediate monetary reward, over a larger, delayed reward. In line, more impulsive behaviour in the stop signal task of insulin-resistant subjects was mediated by striatal activation. Furthermore, overweight and obesity, which can be concomitant with insulin resistance, are associated with impaired learning from negative feedback. Human studies reveal that insulin resistance also affects\ncxqi | motivation. The influence of insulin on motivation highly depends on a person's satiety or hunger state of the organism: while hunger is associated with higher motivation for reward in insulin-sensitive humans, this effect gets lost in insulin-resistant humans. Interventions improving insulin signalling such as GLP-1 analogues restore the effect of hunger on motivation in insulin-resistant humans. Importantly, this holds true for both food and monetary reward, indicating that insulin resistance not only impairs food related behaviour but is relevant for pathological states characterized by generally diminished motivational behaviour.\nqfmx | Collectively, and aligned with the preclinical findings, impaired insulin signalling in humans impairs food cue reactivity, learning and nutritional state-dependent motivation for reward.\nrut3 | Four. Clinical link to depression\nm3cp | Given the influence of insulin and insulin resistance on reward behaviour, it is unsurprising that epidemiological studies have established a clear link between diabetes and depression and in particular anhedonia. Multiple meta-analyses showed a strong relationship between depression or anhedonia and obesity which is associated with insulin resistance. Indeed, longitudinal studies demonstrated, that obesity increased the risk of experiencing depressive symptoms one to five years later, indicating a causal role on an epidemiological level. Interestingly, this association was not explained by socio-demographic, lifestyle, or illness-related factors, including systemic inflammation suggesting that metabolic dysregulation and potentially insulin resistance may play a direct role in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms. Indeed, recent meta-analyses bridge the link between obesity and depression showing that insulin resistance increases the risk for depression: The prevalence of depression is increased to nineteen point one percent range six point five to thirty-three percent for people with type two diabetes compared to ten point seven percent range three point eight to nineteen point four percent in people without diabetes. This is further supported by genetic studies, that report a genetic overlap between obesity, type two diabetes, and depression.\nmq4s | The link between insulin resistance and depression is bidirectional. In depressed patients, both insulin levels and the Homeostatic Model Assessment for insulin resistance a proxy for peripheral insulin resistance are elevated during the acute episode but not during remission. Insulin resistance is associated with increased disease severity and compromised antidepressant treatment efficacy. In a sub-analysis, Fernandes et al. revealed that in particular \"atypical depression\" is linked to increased insulin resistance. Although the concept of \"atypical depression\" mood reactivity, hyperphagia, hypersomnia, interpersonal difficulty is still under debate, notably increased appetite and weight gain belong to the core features of this subtype. In fact, about thirty-five percent of Major Depressive Disorder patients report increased appetite during a depressive episode, and about twenty percent of Major Depressive Disorder patients gain weight. Moreover, weight gain across depressive episodes is highly correlated within patients, suggesting a trait-like character. Therefore, it is unclear whether increased food intake results in reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, or rather insulin resistance leads to mesolimbic dysregulation that is known to drive food intake. Supporting the latter hypothesis, Simmons et al. discovered that increased appetite in Major Depressive Disorder patients was related to insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation IL-one receptor antagonist and interleukin-six although the Body Mass Index was not different from patients with reduced appetite. In fact, the extent of insulin resistance correlated with the insular cortex response to food cues. In a large sample of four hundred Major Depressive Disorder patients, Kroemer et al. confirmed that the direction of appetite change is characterised by a specific neuronal signature. In resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, they found different Nucleus Accumbens functional connectivity patterns between patients with increased and reduced\n95el | appetite; this study however did not consider metabolic parameters. Beyond appetite changes, anhedonia was found to be strongly linked with poor glycaemic control odds ratio one point two nine, ninety-five percent confidence interval one point zero nine to one point five two in five thousand seven hundred seventy-two Major Depressive Disorder patients, but in a smaller sample of six hundred four participants with type one and three hundred eighty-two participants with type two diabetes, Ehrmann et al. could not replicate this finding.\na0a5 | Four point one. The molecular mechanisms linking diabetes and depression\ngocl | Despite the clear link between diabetes and depression on an epidemiological level, the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Given the aforementioned evidence on dopamine-insulin interaction, impaired dopamine signalling in conditions of central insulin resistance has been proposed as a potential mechanism between depressive and anxious symptoms. In the last few years, a wave of fundamental rodent studies has provided evidence that insulin resistance in brain dopamine pathways can lead to depressive and anxious symptoms. This has been shown across different models of insulin resistance including High Fat Diet-induced insulin resistance, Streptozotocin-induced diabetes, and insulin receptor knockout in neurons or glial cells.\nob1z | Kleinridders et al. reported that brain or neuron insulin receptor knockout NIRKO mice, show age-dependent depressive and anxious behaviour due to impaired mitochondrial function and increased dopamine turnover by monoamine oxidase, which is normally suppressed by insulin. Insulin receptor knock-out in glial cells, in turn, reduces ATP exocytosis, resulting in decreased purinergic signalling on dopamine neurons and subsequently anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour. Mechanistically, a subsequent hyperdopaminergic state within the amygdala is probably responsible for the increase in anxiety observed in insulin-resistant and diabetic rats. Interestingly, downregulation of the insulin receptor in the hypothalamus can also induce depressive-like behaviour in rodents indicating that insulin signalling in the hypothalamus might also affect dopamine signalling in the midbrain.\nm4cb | Four point two.
