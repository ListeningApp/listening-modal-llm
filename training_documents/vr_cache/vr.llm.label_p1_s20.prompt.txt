You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

06yq | Virtual reality as a clinical tool in mental health research and practice
dpv6 | Virtual reality (VR) is a potentially powerful technology for enhancing assessment in mental health. At any time or place, individuals can be transported into immersive and interactive virtual worlds that are fully controlled by the researcher or clinician. This capability is central to recent interest in how VR might be harnessed in both treatment and assessment of mental health conditions. The current review provides a summary of the advantages of using VR for assessment in mental health, focusing on increasing ecological validity of highly controlled environments, enhancing personalization and engagement, and capturing real-time, automated data in real-world contexts. Considerations for the implementation of VR in research and clinical settings are discussed, including current issues with cost and access, developing evidence base, technical challenges, and ethical implications. The opportunities and challenges of VR are important to understand as researchers and clinicians look to harness this technology to improve mental health outcomes. 2019, AICH - Servier Group Dialogues Clin Neurosci. 2020;22(2):169-177. doi:10.31887/DCNS.2020.22.2/lvalmaggia

2taz | Introduction
o3ya | Developments in virtual reality (VR) have the potential to radically transform the landscape of assessment in mental health. Immersive VR involves wearing an enclosed head- mounted device (HMD) that displays three dimensional images on a screen so that the person is fully immersed in a virtual environment (eg, Figure 1).1 Images are continu- ously rendered relative to the position of the head and can capture movements of the body, allowing users to explore and interact with objects and avatars (digital agents) in the virtual space. These virtual environments are either programmed using specialist software to create comput- er-generated, photorealistic images, or filmed with special- ized cameras to create 360-degree videos of real-world

5gui | scenes that can be replayed within VR. Together, these capabilities make it possible for researchers and clinicians to observe and record individuals in highly controlled and near-natural environments, in real time.
82qc | VR has been applied for the delivery of exposure-based treatments, whereby individuals can experience feared situations or contexts in a safe and controlled manner, without leaving the clinical setting. Indeed, VR exposure treatments have proven effective across a range of mental health conditions. A number of reviews have been written on the topic of VR-based treatments for psychiatric condi- tions more broadly.2-7 Freeman et al4 conducted a system- atic review in 2017, finding 154 studies on VR treatments for a range of mental health disorders. Further reviews

Exposure therapy is notably dominant within this literature, highlighting how the ability of VR to recreate real-world environments has been leveraged to target the mechanism underpinning exposure. However, in general, innovation has not moved far from this approach, with more novel clinical applications of VR yet to be explored. One such applica- tion of VR within treatment is its use as a clinical assess- ment tool, a topic of relatively limited discussion within the literature. Clinical assessment is an integral element of mental health treatment, from diagnosis to treatment plan- ning and monitoring. As such, the aim of this review is to orient the reader to the clinical application of VR as an assessment tool within mental health research and practice. The specific capabilities that underlie the utility of VR for clinical assessment is provided, as well as examples from

5746 | Benefits of virtual reality for assessment
7toz | From symptoms and cognition to functioning and capacity, the measurement of psychological phenomena is central to research and practice in mental health.9 Although we can have confidence in current assessment instruments to a certain degree, there are many threats to reliability and validity.10 Differences between the assessment context (eg, a lab or clinic) and the real world generate multiple sources of potential bias, threatening the accuracy of results. Real-world assessments are possible, but can be costly and time consuming, and access can be limited by location and mobility. VR may overcome many of these limitations through the ability to generate highly controlled, real-world experiences.11
j346 | Enhancing ecological validity
v8uq | With technological advances over the past decade in partic- ular, VR has become increasingly immersive. By immersing individuals in real-world situations through VR, it is possible to conduct assessments that more closely emulate what happens in daily life. This capability overcomes the issue of ecological validity, that is, the degree to which the find- ings of research studies generalize to real-world settings.11 Research has consistently shown that individuals respond to virtual environments as if they were experiencing them in real life. 12-15 Virtual environments are known to produce physiological changes consistent with emotional responses to real-world scenarios13,16,17 and have the ability to elicit symptoms such as paranoia, 18,19 cravings, 20,21 anxiety, 14,15,22 and fear.23 A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials comparing VR exposure with in vivo exposure for phobias found equivalent effects for both interventions, suggesting similar processes occur.24 Experiences in VR have also been found to elicit predictable behaviors, with one study finding that people with higher levels of paranoia kept a greater interpersonal distance from avatars within a virtual environment, which was considered a reflection of perceived trust and social threat.25 These findings highlight one of the main advantages of VR within mental health: the ability to simulate experiences in everyday life.

4i0e | comparatively to assessments conducted in the real world. 12,26-28 Gorini et al12 examined emotional reactions to food in a virtual kitchen, a real kitchen, and in photographs, among individuals with eating disorders. They found that both real and virtual exposure to food cues elicited the same emotional reactions, which were greater than those elicited by the photographs. VR also enables access to situations and experiences previously difficult to attain in research, such as hard to reach or dangerous environments. For example, VR has been used in neuroimaging research to study brain activation in naturalistic scenarios, a method previously impossible from inside the scanner.29 Furthermore, since recent developments have resulted in VR becoming completely mobile, assess- ments do not need to occur within the clinic or lab, allowing people to access them remotely.30 The possibility to deliver automated assessments in people's homes, independent from a clinician, is an exciting opportunity to increase effi- ciency, improve accessibility, and reduce cost.
h2l3 | Sufficient evidence has accumulated to support the benefits of VR for a variety of assessment purposes in mental health
dfzb | Control and manipulation of the virtual environment VR offers the ability to control and manipulate features of the environment that can be used to test and assess rele- vant variables, such as eliciting paranoia in social situ- ations18,31,32 or examining responses to cues within the environment. 12,20,21 Experimental control is a cornerstone of psychological research, enabling direct comparison between conditions to determine causal relationships between vari- ables. Strong methodological rigor can be achieved in VR through careful manipulation of variables across condi- tions in virtual environments.11 For example, Veling et al31 randomized participants with psychosis, siblings, and health controls to conditions with varying levels of social stress within a virtual environment. They found a dose-response relationship between social stress and paranoia, which was associated with psychosis liability, supporting the theory that social stress may account for the relationship between the environment and psychosis. Another example comes from Freeman et al33 who examined experiences of paranoia and perceptions of social rank within a virtual underground train. Participants were placed in two conditions: one where they were taller than others on the train and another where they were shorter. Findings showed that under the condition
u6ty | DIALOGUES IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE . Vol 22 . No. 2 . 2020 . 171
awvu | where they were shorter, participants had a more negative view of themselves relative to others and greater levels of paranoia. The differences in paranoia were fully mediated by social comparison, suggesting that negative views of the self, relative to others, may drive feelings of mistrust.
on9b | Another capability of VR is that individuals are able to interact with objects within the system, rather than simply observing or imag- ining different scenarios. This not only enhances ecological validity, as interaction is inherent to the real world, but also allows researchers to examine behaviors of individuals within the virtual environment and their impact by manip- ulating different contingencies.34 Previously, this type of research was only possible using actors or "confederates" who performed certain roles within situations, which was costly and limited in ecological validity. Furthermore, the controlled nature of the experience enables greater repro- ducibility relative to field studies where the environment is constantly changing. These capabilities have important implications for social psychology,35 but also for identifying differences characteristic of mental disorders.5 For example, previous studies have demonstrated that exposure of each participant to the same virtual scenario can allow controlled examination of the determinants of paranoid ideation. 18,33,36,37 As such, the enhanced environmental control and interac- tivity of VR allows for standardization of otherwise dynamic variables, ensuring a consistent assessment experience, both over time and across individuals.
a8ge | Personalization and tailoring
h27a | Because virtual environments are computer-generated or recorded, it is also possible to program tailored VR expe- riences that match individual needs, abilities, or prefer- ences (eg, slowing down a sequence, using text or audio instructions, minimizing distraction). Rizzo et al38 devel- oped a VR-based exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that enabled the therapist to customize various features of a combat scenario most relevant to the trauma experienced by soldiers. Since effective treatment of PTSD requires exposure to cues of highly idiosyncratic experiences, customization of the virtual environment is an important feature. Such customization also has important

xmgs | utility for assessment purposes, though very little research has examined this to date. For example, functional analysis involves the examination of how symptoms change in rela- tion to different triggers and responses.39 VR could be used to examine changes in symptoms across different situations and in relation to certain cues, for example visual, auditory, and olfactory, allowing precise insight into the determinants of relevant clinical events. Gatti et al40 describe a VR protocol whereby clinicians were able to customize the virtual envi- ronment with personally relevant cues to alcohol craving and behaviors for the purposes of clinical formulation. The ability to perform psychiatric assessment via personalized tests and tasks meaningful to the individual and their situ- ation is powerful but is currently understudied within VR.
bd9h | Real-time, automated data capture
m047 | The benefits of using technology for automatic data capture has been well recognized.41 Mobile apps for tracking symp- toms and other clinically relevant information over time42 has been a major area of progress in digital mental health, with findings suggesting that they are feasible and accept- able to individuals.43,44 Researchers are starting to consider how data collected from devices such as smartphone apps and VR might be clinically informative. Patterns in data collected from technology devices, such as movement, speech, and geolocation, have been associated with changes in symptoms45 and may even be used to predict relapse among people with psychosis.42
gy8c | It is possible to capture data automatically from users during VR experiences. Eye-tracking software can be integrated with VR,30 capturing a source of data commonly used to identify markers of psychiatric disorders and cognition.46 It is also possible to measure behaviors within the virtual environment, such as decisions about how to navigate and interact with different objects and agents.25 Capturing the temporal relationship between variables in real time (ie, how thoughts, emotions, and behaviors unfold in relation to changes in the environment), makes it possible to test hypothesized processes and causal interactions. Further- more, physiological measures commonly used as objective indicators of psychological states, such as heart rate and galvanic skin response, can be recorded and synced with virtual content or even eye gaze. Mühlberger et al47 devel- oped a VR-delivered behavioral avoidance test (VR-BAT) to assess fear in specific phobia while automatically collecting heart rate, skin conductance, subjective rating of discom-

vpgq | fort, and stimulus-approach distance. Results indicated that the physiological measures were good predictors of fear intensity. Others have begun to investigate integrating more sophisticated biosensors, such as wireless electroencepha- lography (EEG), with VR to assess psychologically relevant constructs such as emotional state, with the aim to feed the data back to clinicians for enhanced decision making48 or even within VR itself as biofeedback.49
ousl | Increasing engagement
m4ju | Another benefit of delivering clinical evaluation via VR is the potential to enhance an individual's engagement with the test or assessment. Traditional testing procedures undertaken in mental health can be lengthy, repetitive, and/ or laborious, which may impact individual performance, especially for measures of attention or memory. Therefore, replacing traditional assessment with more engaging, mean- ingful, or enjoyable methods has substantial appeal. This is particularly important given that symptoms such as poor concentration and lack of motivation are common across mental health conditions.50 This application of VR may also be of benefit in young people experiencing mental ill-health, a population where digital technologies are common and their use for mental health is promising. 51
a0mb | VR may enhance engagement with clinical evaluations through the immersive, realistic, enjoyable environments enabled by the technology.52,53 The term "presence" has been used in VR research to refer to the subjective experience of being in a place or environment, even when one is physi- cally situated in another.1 The feeling of presence is influ- enced by the degree of immersion, defined as the extent to which the system generates sensory stimulation consistent with sensorimotor experience (eg, images are updated as the head moves). Sense of presence has traditionally been linked to an individual's level of engagement54 and moti- vation.55 As such, high rates of presence and immersion reported within investigations of clinical uses of VR point to the ability of the technology to enhance engagement with clinical evaluation.56-58 However, it is currently difficult to create VR environments with a high level of realism, which can create a strong aversion to the experience.59
ki8m | VR could further increase engagement with clinical evalua- tion by adding elements of digital games to the assessments, a process known as "gamification."60 Incorporating features of games, such as rewards and feedback, within VR may
