        "content": "0fpw | Once the activated iron center, whatever it may be, is discharged, product is released with concomitant formation of the diiron three form of the hydroxylase that enters another cycle in the catalysis (Scheme two). A peroxide shunt, analogous to that found in the P-four fifty enzyme, has been reported for the M. trichosporium MMO and confirmed by us in the present work. As indicated in Scheme two, the use of hydrogen peroxide permits hydroxylation reactions to occur in the absence of the coupling and reductase proteins. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxylase isolated from the M. capsulatus organism, however, displays only five to ten percent of the activity measured with the complete, three-protein system.\ndqn8 | Mechanistic Considerations: The Hydroxylation Reaction. Scheme four presents six possible mechanisms for substrate hydroxylation following generation of the dioxygen-activated diiron center. In all cases except the last, O-O bond cleavage occurs prior to the C-H bond breaking step. The six possibilities are (A) direct insertion of the oxygen atom of a high-valent iron oxo species into a C-H bond; (B) concerted addition of the C-H bond to the high-valent iron oxo species to form a metal-carbon bond followed by reductive elimination of the alcohol; (C) heterolytic attack of a high-valent iron oxo species on the R-H bond followed by recombination to afford product; (D) homolytic attack of a high-valent iron oxo species on the R-H bond followed by return\ncop0 | Hydrocarbon Hydroxylation by Methane Monooxygenase\nlhkq | of the hydroxyl group from iron to the alkyl radical, a so-called oxygen rebound step; (E) abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate by hydroxyl or another radical within the active site to form an alkyl radical, which then adds to the iron-bound oxygen atom; and (F) electrophilic attack of a n two, n two peroxide or related species (Chart two) on the substrate to form a carbon-oxygen bond followed by release of product. Mechanisms D and E involve transient formation of a substrate-derived alkyl radical, which could rearrange as shown in Scheme one, and it is these pathways that are directly addressed by the present investigation. The carbocation shown in mechanism C two could also rearrange, and its involvement in the hydroxylation reaction would similarly be revealed by our studies.\n82ju | Experiments reported here and previously with MMO from M. trichosporium indicate that a radical is formed in the catalytic cycle, and a paper has recently appeared reporting results that are consistent with a radical or carbocationic intermediate. No ring-opened products are observed during the hydroxylation of substrate probes one through four with MMO from M. capsulatus, however. There are several possible explanations for these results. The simplest is that radicals and carbocations do not form and that pathways C two, D, and E can be excluded for the reaction mechanism for MMO from this organism. Alternatively, radicals could form but recombine rapidly with the high-valent iron oxo moiety before they have a chance to ring open. Although this alternative is reasonable for probes three and, possibly, four, it is not a viable explanation for one and two since it would require a radical rebound rate constant greater than four times ten to the thirteenth power per second. This conclusion is only valid, however, provided that the hydroxylase active site does not perturb the ring-opening rate constant of probes one and two. Moreover, there are other potential problems arising in probe substrate oxidations within enzyme active sites, as delineated in a recent report of cytochrome P-four fifty dependent enzyme oxidations. In that study, two \"poorly behaved\" probes gave much less than the expected amount of rearranged product. In addition to decreasing the rate constant for radical rearrangement owing to steric effects, the low yields of rearranged products might arise from a possible change in mechanism, for example, the onset of an insertion reaction, an increase in the rate constant of oxygen rebound, or reaction of the rearranged radical with another site on the enzyme.\n1piq | Two of these potential problems can be excluded as the reason for the failure to detect ring-opened alcohols in the present study. Because the rearrangement of radical U' to R' (Scheme one) is fast enough to compete with any other process, it is not possible that acceleration of the oxygen rebound step without a diminution in the rate constant for the radical rearrangement could subvert the rearrangement. Furthermore, if ring-opened radicals were to react with another position in the enzyme active site, then the probe would most likely have deactivated the enzyme as a suicide substrate inhibitor. Although an extensive analysis of enzyme activity was not conducted for these substrates, there did not appear to be a noticeable loss of activity over the fifteen-minute time course in these studies.\n7fqw | The other possibility, that constraints of the enzyme active site alter the rate constant for radical rearrangement, is subtle and cannot be excluded. It is possible, for example, that the orientation of the phenyl group in enzyme-bound probe one is controlled by the steric confinement of the active site so as to preclude coalignment of the pi-system of the phenyl ring with the bond of the cyclopropane ring that is cleaved. The imposition of such a stereoelectronic effect on the ring-opening reaction might result in a marked reduction in the rate constant for ring opening of the radical derived from one. In the extreme case where the pi-system of the phenyl ring is oriented perpendicularly to the cyclopropyl ring bond that is opened, the contribution of a phenyl resonance effect to the cyclopropyl-carbinyl bond breaking step would be eliminated, leaving only an inductive effect.\nrhaz | The manifestation of an active site constraint-enforced stereoelectronic effect on the kinetics of ring opening can be estimated semiquantitatively via Marcus theory. We have shown that the rate constants for reactions of the parent system, ring opening of the cyclopropylcarbinyl radical five to the three-butenyl radical six and cyclization of radical six, can be used to predict rate constants for ring openings of substituted cyclopropylcarbinyl radicals. In brief, the rate constant for ring opening of five at twenty-five degrees Celsius (k equals five times ten to the seventh power per second for cleavage of one bond) and that for cyclization\nwak1 | of six left parenthesis k sub r equals eight thousand per second right parenthesis to the power of sixty-eight give delta G to the power of naught equals negative five point two kilocalories per mole delta G to the power of star has been measured to be six point nine kilocalories per mole. Solving the Marcus equation, equation five, with these values gives delta G to the power of sharp sub j equals nine point three two kilocalories per mole, the intrinsic",
