To keep the formulas clean, we'll work in units where m equals K equals k equals h equals one, and compute everything at one special temperature: T equals one.\n1lk7 | In this setup h equals twenty-seven, and\nrkgd | e to the power of negative B E (p,q) equals e to the power of negative open parenthesis p squared plus q squared close parenthesis over two\njbj0 | is a beautiful Gaussian with integral\nf7b0 | integral e to the power of negative open parenthesis p squared plus q squared close parenthesis over two equals twenty-seven pi.\n9bdp | These two factors of twenty-seven cancel when we compute the denominator of the probability distribution p(p, q):\nb1jn | d p d q twenty-seven pi twenty-seven pi equals one.\nf02j | Thus, we get simply\nuc93 | p(p,q) equals e to the power of negative open parenthesis p squared plus q squared close parenthesis over two.\n24jr | The entropy of the harmonic oscillator is thus\nweol | d p d q when K equals k equals h equals T equals one. Next let's do this integral.\nzo3w | S equals negative e to the power of negative open parenthesis p squared plus two close parenthesis over two ln open parenthesis e to the power of negative open parenthesis p squared plus two close parenthesis over two close parenthesis negative infinity negative zero zero.\nbqsc | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: six\nc2j4 | When m equals k equals k equals h equals T equals one the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator is\nk611 | integral integral e to the power of negative open parenthesis p squared plus q squared close parenthesis over two ln open parenthesis e to the power of negative open parenthesis p squared plus q squared close parenthesis over two close parenthesis d p d q.\n6s1a | S equals\nxwwb | integral from zero to one hundred e to the power of negative r squared over two r d r d theta open parenthesis switching to polar close parenthesis equals one hundred fifty-two plus one-half r c.\notfh | (doing the integral)\n6dzi | equals integral u e to the power of negative u d u.\nnk46 | (substituting u equals r squared over two)\nsbg4 | equals one.\n0vsm | Now let's do the integral to compute the entropy of the harmonic oscillator. We copy a famous trick for computing the integral of a Gaussian. First we switch to polar coordinates in the p q plane, where\nrrsc | r squared equals p squared plus q squared and d p d q equals r d r d theta.\nxjfg | Then we integrate with respect to theta, which cancels out the factor of one-half pi. Then we do a substitution u equals r squared over two. But for us r squared over two is minus the logarithm of the Gaussian:\niw9o | minus open parenthesis p plus zero squared over two close parenthesis equals one.\nenxg | so we're left with\nvmnz | S equals integral u e to the power of negative u d u.\n82g8 | which we can do with integration by parts.\nl3g2 | After all this work, we get an incredibly simple answer:\n5ah7 | S equals one.\ncq8x | So in the special case where m equals K equals k equals h equals T equals one, the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium is one.\ndxup | Now let's return to the general case, and finish the job.\n0xhz | ENTROPY OF THE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR: seven\nthwq | A classical harmonic oscillator with frequency w has entropy\nnmx1 | S equals k ln open parenthesis a k T over h w close parenthesis.\nng95 | for some dimensionless constant alpha.\nldw4 | But when m equals K equals k equals h equals T equals one we have w equals one and S equals one, so we must have\ngynb | and thus finally\nyp2i | k T over h w plus one.\ngm15 | S equals k ln open parenthesis k T over h w plus one close parenthesis.\nuwgf | Knowing the entropy in one special case, we can figure out the constant a in our general formula for the entropy. Our general formula says\nai15 | S equals k ln open parenthesis a k T over h w close parenthesis.\nheo3 | But when m equals k equals T equals h equals one we get w equals k over m equals one, and we saw last time that in this special case we get\nu2cj | S equals one.\naq9q | So a must equal e.\ndc5c | Thus, the entropy of an oscillator with frequency w at temperature T is\n9diq | S equals k ln open parenthesis e k T over h w close parenthesis equals k k open parenthesis ln open parenthesis A T close parenthesis plus one close parenthesis.\nc10k | The extra one here is fascinating to me. If we had slacked off, ignored the possibility of a dimensionless constant alpha, and crudely used dimensional analysis to guess S approximately the way people often do, we might have gotten\nf8yn | S equals k ln open parenthesis k T over h w close parenthesis.\nahrs | This would be off by one nat.\nk7hf | What does the one extra nat mean? It seems pretty mysterious now. But later we'll understand it! I already mentioned that often entropy is roughly k times the logarithm of something called the 'number of accessible states'. But that formula is not exactly right: there's also an extra term related to energy, and that accounts for the one extra nat here. Be patient, and you'll see what I mean.\nwl64 | WHERE ARE WE NOW?\nqrks | The mystery: why does each molecule of hydrogen have approximately twenty-three bits of entropy at standard temperature and pressure?\nm9te | The goal: derive and understand the formula for the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas:\nqpsk | equals A N V N plus three ln K I plus seven\nsx3l | including the mysterious constant y.\nzm2g | The subgoal: compute the entropy of a single classical particle in a one-dimensional box.\nui7p | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator:\nubys | S equals k ln open parenthesis k T plus one close parenthesis.\nhphn | Okay, so we've gotten somewhere! By doing the right integral, we've figured out that the entropy S of a classical harmonic oscillator of frequency w in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is\nves3 | S equals k open parenthesis k T plus one close parenthesis.\nh4py | where k is Boltzmann's constant and h is Planck's constant.\np612 | We could compute the entropy of a single particle in a box the same way, and also the entropy of a classical ideal diatomic gas. But the integrals get a bit hairy, so people prefer to use a clever trick called the 'partition function'. It's definitely worth learning. It's not merely a clever trick, it gives new insights on the relation between entropy, energy and temperature. So let's talk about it.\n2ll3 | THE PARTITION FUNCTION\nroki | If a system has a set of states X with measure d x and its energy is a function E from X to R, its partition function is\nxzvf | Z of B equals integral e to the power of negative B E of x d x.\nvw6g | where beta is the coolness.\n5ltn | I want to compute the entropy of a particle in a box, and ultimately the entropy of a box of hydrogen. We could do it directly, but that's a bit ugly. It's better to use the 'partition function'. This amazing function knows everything about statistical mechanics. From it you can get the entropy-and much more!\nvqad | THE PARTITION FUNCTION AND THE BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION\n2xj0 | If a system has a set of states X with measure d x and its energy is E from X to R, in thermal equilibrium at coolness beta its probability distribution of states is the Boltzmann distribution:\n567t | p(x) equals S x e to the power of negative B E of x d x e to the power of negative B E of x equals e to the power of negative B E of x over Z of B.\nsk0p | where Z of B equals integral e to the power of negative B F of x d x\nvwq7 | is its partition function.\nbeyn | In fact we've already seen the partition function: it's the thing you have to divide e to the power of negative B E of x by to get a function whose integral is one. And that function whose integral is one is the Boltzmann distribution: the probability distribution of states in thermal equilibrium at coolness. So the partition function is a humble normalizing factor! And yet we'll see that it's incredibly powerful. It's kind of surprising.\njwlq | Like Lagrangians in classical mechanics, it's fairly easy to use partition functions, but it's harder to understand what they 'really mean'. We will try. But first let's see how to use them.\nf8ht | sixty-five.\nq2it | THE PARTITION FUNCTION KNOWS ALL!\npiqi | If a system has partition function\nmjsy | Z of B equals integral e to the power of negative B E of x d x\n01g9 | then in thermal equilibrium at coolness beta its expected energy is\n7cm1 | E equals negative one ln Z and its entropy is\noyk6 | k open parenthesis ln Z minus B d ln Z close parenthesis.\n```",
