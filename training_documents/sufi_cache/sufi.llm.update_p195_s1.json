        "content": "hen3 | A Bridge and its Use\nuh4k | It will seem improbable, yet it is no exaggeration to say that people ignore, are unaware of or even sneer at materials which could be their only hope of escaping from circular thinking.\n4fkf | I have learned more from people, things and ideas which are by many considered irrelevant, slight or even worthless, than from much more advertised and crudely emphasized materials.\nirnw | People who cannot or will not approach these sources of knowledge may accept them when they have been put in a manner which they are prepared to accept. This indicates the serious limitation on learning imposed by so many people's refusal to look at anything which seems to them to be unsuitable, judged from its outward face.\ngbc0 | But this is only the first part of a process. You can 'popularise' or make palatable, but at some point you must direct attention to the original thing.\n7fxf | If we have to act as a bridge, we must fulfil the function of a bridge, which is to conduct from one side of something to another side.\n6nc8 | Dimensions of a Foot\nstnz | I remember the case of one person who was able to understand this, and hence to become sensitive to the existence and operation of a Sufi school imperceptible to others, by simply digesting the statement of Rumi, in Fihi ma Fihi:\n18xh | 'I am a shoemaker, with much leather. But I do the cutting and the stitching according to the dimensions of the foot'\nmf3x | Deterioration of Studies\nw3uc | Q: How do studies deteriorate?\nptio | A: People look for new teachings, or the revelation of concealed ancient ones, when their problem rightly may be that they cannot see the presence of the teaching in the materials abundantly available to them, ancient and otherwise.\ni2jr | They cannot see these teachings because they have chosen to blind themselves to the intention of a teaching-technique. They have 'superficialised' their own heritage of materials. Here is an example:\ngu0m | Many people are impressed by the example that if they look at something for half a minute, they will find their attention wandering. Instead of looking at this as an indication of fact, complete in itself, they do two unnecessarily shallow things; they\n2nkh | One. Try to look at things for long periods in the hope that they will be able to develop attention capacity. They never achieve it, however, when they try in this manner, because the description of the deficiency does not of course contain the technique;\nqvbd | Two. Immediately assume that the person who drew their attention to their lack of attention is able to supply them with the method or system whereby they can remedy the situation. They seldom seem to imagine that, if a man says, 'This door is splintered' he does not necessarily know how to mend it.\nyelz | These people have lost the versatility of thinking which was the hallmark of ancient teaching. They have 'idolatrised' ideas, by making omniscience resident in illustration. This is exactly what a totemist does. The modern man does not, however, recognise himself as a totemist, perhaps because he does not live in a tropical jungle.\nll1t | The Real Poor\nv77n | The great Sheikh Abdullah Ansar of Herat said that the really\n01ga | poor are those who are not independent of poverty: those who really care whether they are poor or not poor. Similarly, attachment to secondary concepts causes studies to deteriorate - for when this is the rule, the container is mistaken for the content. There has never been any lack of people who imagine that the physical absence of something is poverty, and that the ownership of material objects is riches. The question of attitude is absent.\nx623 | You ask how studies deteriorate. One of the causes is the sheer weight of numbers of deluded or superficial people who demand 'deep studies' or 'spiritual knowledge'. They create a supply-and-demand situation which can cause so much imitation of teaching and learning that the imitation is taken for the real.\n3w43 | Indians Prohibited\nre9w | In a story current in India, an Indian student in the United States heard that a countryman of his was teaching Hindu spirituality to the people of the West, and was well established there, although he still lived near Delhi for most of the year. When he went home on a vacation, the student sought out the great guru and respectfully sought to become a disciple.\nf8s3 | 'I'm sorry,' said the chief assistant guru at the Ashram: 'we don't take Indians here - only Europeans or Americans.'\nuz19 | The young Hindu was aghast. I thought that the days of colonialist discrimination were over!' he gasped. 'You mean that you won't accept me as a disciple, here in my own country?'\nosb6 | My dear chap', said the great guru himself, coming to the ashram gate, 'the facts are the other way round: have you ever actually seen any of the terrible people who want to drink deep of Indian spirituality? I am trying to protect my countrymen from them.'\nxv5c | Community and Human Growth\nh97k | Q: How does human growth take place in a community, and what are the dangers of operating in a randomly-collected group?\n4hn0 | A: Take certain kinds of organisation and the beliefs about them which are commonly held. Then examine another attitude towards them, in order to learn something.\nwxgh | A certain society is called Freemasons. It is ritualistic, is thought to have 'secrets', and is named after a vocation. People believe that Masonry grew up because of the comradeship of masons and their desire to monopolise certain building knowledge and even to regulate the supply of labour.\nlpjm | Now look at apprenticeship in Europe, Africa and Asia, applied in a wide variety of crafts. Again, there are initiation and other ceremonies. There is a certain relationship, including a contract, between the master and pupil.\n6w91 | Now recall to your mind the special ritualism and connection contained in the institution of kingship. And the rumours and beliefs of special developments or binding force between members of families, clans and other collections of people.\n80wh | What these all have in common is the belief that certain extraordinary perceptions can be developed by means of a certain kind of human association (call it the alchemist and his assistants, the carpet-making fraternity, one of a hundred others) whether or not the individual entering into the association is at first aware of this extra element. In other words, the verbalised form of teaching, even of introduction to higher (or inner) learning, is only one possible approach.\nm5a9 | It is, however, not enough that there should be a collection of people with an aim of working in unison or towards an objective: even though without this, the enterprise is absurd.\n3i4d | Aspiration and desire are not enough: and the leadership must understand this as well.\no24c | The Mulla and the Drought\np2on | The conception is illustrated in this Nasrudin tale:\n8fiw | One day Mulla Nasrudin saw a schoolmaster leading a group of his pupils towards a mosque.\nsmhv | The Mulla asked:\n1bgr | 'What is the purpose of this activity, Learned One?'\nxl1f | 'There is a drought,' said the teacher, 'and we are hoping that the cries of the innocent will move the Heavens.'\nfmr7 | 'Cries, innocent or guilty,' said Nasrudin, 'can have no such effect without knowledge.'\nw10v | 'How can you prove such a dangerous statement?' spluttered the affronted pedagogue.\nrqey | 'Easily,' said Nasrudin, 'because if supplications were enough: intentions led by apparent necessity, there would not be a schoolteacher left on earth. Children yearn for their abolition.\nx4xb | 'So, even if the children's heart cries could have you banished, it would be the prayers of the people of knowledge alone, who understand your function, which still sustain you among us.'\nfnmf | In addition to the enterprise on hand, there must be a correct selection of the particular team. This selection must be effected by a teacher. But, once these conditions are fulfilled, there is no further need of one single word from any of the vocabularies of metaphysics or philosophy, esotericism as we know them.",
