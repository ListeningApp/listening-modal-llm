You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

863b | Statistical analysis
fj24 | We undertook all statistical analysis with SPSS (IBM 2017), with initial screening in Excel (Microsoft 2019). Significance for all tests was determined at the <LATEX>p \leq 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level. We interpret effect sizes and power requirements in line with Cohen's (1988) widely accepted benchmarks.
uz3c | Alternative measurement definitions
d5bi | We used Kappa Measure of Agreements to gauge the level of agreement between the FFIT categorical classi- fications under DS1, DS2, and DS3 measurement defi- nitions, investigating hypothesis 1. High agreement indicates high stability in the classification. Table 2 shows how many participants fit each of the FFIT's body shapes, according to differential measurement definitions. We selected the hourglass body as the ref- erence shape because it was the most common in DS1: FFIT's 'standard' interpretation.
ba4l | Alternative waist definition's measurement impact We used T-Tests to investigate the differences between alternative waist measurement definitions. T-
ffx8 | test one - Association of Waist - investigates hypoth- esis 2: the difference in waist measurements taken at the <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> and <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> regions. T-test two - Association of Waist Height - investigates hypothesis 3: the difference in waist heights taken at the <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> and <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> regions.
s6su | Shoulder measurement's predictive capability
y219 | We used Multinomial Logistic Regression to predict the FFIT body shape classification from shoulder measure- ments, investigating hypothesis 4. Our model's depend- ant variable is the FFIT body shape classification. Our factors are shoulder-to-shoulder (horizontal), shoulder- to-shoulder (calliper), and shoulder girth (full). We used Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of shoulder meas- urements to assess Goodness of Fit to the multinomial logistic regression's model, using the same variables.
06ht | We used ANOVA to investigate whether the FFIT's categorical variables associate with alternative shoulder measurements (scale variables). Our ANOVA tests vari- able is Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal), with group- ings: the FFIT body shape classification. We investigate Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) with ANOVA because it is the most potent predictor of the FFIT's body shape classification according to our multinomial logistic regression model. As multiple comparisons in post hoc analysis increase the risk of Type I errors, we apply a Bonferroni adjustment to p0.007, mitigating Type I errors' risk (Tabachnick and Fidell 2007b, 270).
v3r2 | Post hoc power analysis
nv42 | We conducted post hoc power analysis for parametric sta- tistics - in conjunction with calculating sample size based on power calculations - to mitigate Type II errors caused by underpowered samples (Portney and Watkins 2009). We used our statistical analysis' results - i.e. mean differ- ence, standard deviation, and significance - with sample size as inputs for post hoc power analysis with G*Power (Faul et al. 2020). All post hoc power analysis tests showed adequate power <LATEX>\left( \pi > 0 . 8 \right)</LATEX> under commonly accepted power guidelines (Cohen 1988; Aberson 2011).
xags | Results and analysis
jc47 | Comparison of body shape classifications following the FFIT and SizeUK definitions
ko3c | Investigating hypothesis 1, a Kappa Measurement Of Agreement test revealed negligible agreement between the FFIT categorical classifications under dif- ferent measurement definitions: DS1 and DS2
xek3 | <LATEX>\left( K \left( N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 0 . 3 6 9 , p < 0 . 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> DS1 and DS3 <LATEX>\left( K \left( N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 0 . 4 1 0 , p < 0 . 0 1 \right) ,</LATEX> and DS2 and DS3 <LATEX>\left( K \left( N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 0 . 3 5 6 , p < 0 . 0 1 \right) .</LATEX> Table 3 presents the inter-shape agreement for DS1, DS2, and DS3. Between 21.9% and 39.6% of participants are categor- ised into different body shapes, measured by disagree- ment between measurement definitions in Table 3.
bbpr | While rectangle, inverted triangle, and top hourglass show a high level of shape classification agreement under different measurement definitions, hourglass, tri- angle, bottom hourglass, and spoon show low shape- classification agreement; below 50% (Peat 2001, 228).
5zyf | Figure 4 visualises the low degree of agreement in the body shape assigned to participants by the alter- native definitions. Each of Figure 4's lines correspond to a value from Table 3. Thicker lines represent higher levels of agreement, and dashed lines represent homogeneous shape agreement. A stable body classi- fication system would be less influenced by changes in definition and more consistently categorise the same person into the same shape, showing as a sym- metrical diagram. Figure 4 instead shows asymmetrical randomness: exposing how a person can be classified in up to three distinct body shapes - depending on measurement definition selection.
9own | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis 1.
bqfb | Association of waist measurement placement
wwdt | Investigating Hypothesis 2, a paired-sample t-test revealed waist measurements significantly decrease when taken within Size UK's <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> region <LATEX>\left( M = 7 9 . 3 9 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. S D = 1 2 . 6 4 \right)</LATEX> compared to being taken within the FFIT's <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> region (FFIT) <LATEX>\left( M = 7 8 . 1 3 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. S D = 1 2 . 6 4 \right) ,</LATEX> <LATEX>t = 3 2 . 0 3 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1</LATEX> (two-tailed). The t-test achieved <LATEX>\left( 1 - \beta \right.</LATEX> err <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p r o b } \right) = 1 . 0 ,</LATEX> Effect size <LATEX>d z =</LATEX> 0.8 : satisfying our statistical power requirements. The mean decrease was 1.26 cm, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -1.33 cm <LATEX>t o \quad - 1 . 1 8 \quad c m .</LATEX> The eta- squared statistic (0.38) indicates a large effect size.
mn1r | 70.3% of participants had a waist circumference smaller within the FFIT's <LATEX>S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> region than those whose smallest waist circumference lay within SizeUK's SoB + 4.0 cm region. Waist measurements are, therefore, smaller when the 3 D body scanner searched for the narrowest point within a larger waist region starting from the SoB.
5vqw | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis 2.
meyw | Association of waist height
2e62 | Investigating hypothesis 3, a paired-sample t-test of the waist's height taken at the SizeUK's <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> region

Dashed lines agree with consistent classification across measurement sets - e.g. Rectangle with Rectangle -, thin red lines = low agreement through to thick green lines = high agreement.
q1q2 | and the <LATEX>F F I T s \quad S o B + 6 . 3 5 \quad c m</LATEX> region revealed a statistically significant increase in waist location height from defining the region within <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( M = 1 0 4 . 6 6 , \right.</LATEX> <LATEX>\left.

The t-test achieved Power(1 - ß err prob) = 1.0, Effect size <LATEX>d z = 1 . 0 ,</LATEX> satis- fying our statistical power requirements. The mean increase in waist location height was 1.22 cm, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 1.67 to 1.27 cm. The eta- squared statistic (0.56) indicates a large effect size. Our results show that 71.9% of participants had a higher waist
cb7r | height location when measured within the FFIT's <LATEX>\mathrm { S o B } +</LATEX> 6.35 cm region. The large number of participants with their smallest waist existing above SizeUK's <LATEX>S o B + 4 . 0 \quad c m</LATEX> region illustrates the need to consider measurement placement and its impact on shape definitions.
68xu | We, therefore, accept Hypothesis 3.
hd35 | Shoulder measurement's influence
2zpk | Investigating hypothesis 4, we added shoulder measure- ments to a Multinomial Logistic Regression model
epu7 | Table 4. Predictor's unique contributions in the multinomial logistic regression
7od1 | <LATEX>\left( \alpha = 0 . 0 5 \right)</LATEX> containing only the intercept. Adding shoul- der measurements significantly improved the fit between model and data: x2(18, <LATEX>\left. N = 1 6 7 9 \right) =</LATEX> 322.386, Nagelkerke <LATEX>R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> Shoulder-to- Shoulder measurements - Horizontal and Calliper - made significant contributions to the model, as Table 4 shows. Shoulder girth (full) did not, however, signifi- cantly contribute to the model. We confirmed Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' Goodness of Fit through Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for each pair of groups, with both tests reporting
0bqy | <LATEX>p > 0 . 0 5 .</LATEX> Considering parameter estimates, the Horizontal and Calliper shoulder measurements' predictor has six parameters: one for each of the FFIT body shape clas- sifications, excluding the hourglass shape that acted as the reference group. To interpret the differences between predictors, Table 5 shows the parameter esti- mate and lists each shoulder measurement, standar- dised to: <LATEX>M = 0 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>S D =</LATEX> 1.
b780 | Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) is the most powerful predictor for body shape classification com- pared to the hourglass shape. Bottom Hourglass pre- diction is, however, the exception.
ccmb | To improve the model's predictive power, we culled Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Calliper) from the model because of its insignificant association with the FFIT Body Shape Classification. The resulting model was statistically sig- nificant <LATEX>x ^ { 2 } \left( 1 6 \right. ,</LATEX> <LATEX>\left. N = 1 6 7 9 \right) = 2 7 7 . 2 6 5 ,</LATEX> Nagelkerke <LATEX>R ^ { 2 } =</LATEX> 0.16, <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 ,</LATEX> correctly classifying 37.2% of all partici- pants FFIT Body Shape. Despite the significant result, the model cannot correctly predict: Inverted Triangle, Triangle, Top Hourglass, or Spoon shapes, as Table 6 shows. Hourglass was the only shape with a high level of predictive capability: correctly identified in 63.2% of
ma93 | cases. Shoulder-to-Shoulder (Horizontal) may, therefore, be a further factor in defining body shape. Systems like FFIT could include this measurement.
c6hh | We, therefore, reject hypothesis 4.
y7ea | A one-way between-groups analysis of variance explored the FFIT body shape's association with shoul- der-to-shoulder (horizontal) measurements. There was a statistically significant difference at the <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 5</LATEX> level for shoulder measurements for the FFIT's seven body shapes; <LATEX>F \left( 6 , 8 8 . 8 7 \right) = 4 1 . 6 5 8 ,</LATEX> <LATEX>p < 0 . 0 1 .</LATEX> The <LATEX>^ { 2 }</LATEX> was 0.16, indicating a large effect size. The ANOVA test achieved <LATEX>\left( 1 - \beta \right.</LATEX> err <LATEX>\left. \mathrm { p r o b } \right) = 1 . 0 ,</LATEX> Effect size <LATEX>f =</LATEX> 0.41, satisfying our statistical power requirements. Table 7 presents the post hoc - pairwise - comparisons using the Tukey HSD test, with a Bonferroni adjustment of
