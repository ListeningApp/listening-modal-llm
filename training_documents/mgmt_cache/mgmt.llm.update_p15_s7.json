        "content": "sk5m | Structure. All of Haier's \"reinventions\" over more than three decades have been top-down driven and have been initiated before many would have considered this \"necessary\". Haier is well-known for disrupting itself or cannibalizing its own cash flows. Doing this well requires an appropriate structure.\nqws8 | Haier's structure might both obstruct and stimulate innovative changes in management practices. Being originally a municipality-owned enterprise, the functional structure, with tight separation between units and departments, might prevent implementing new ideas and meeting user needs. At the same time, Haier's top-down, hierarchical structure helped Zhang to effectively introduce and diffuse his new management approaches throughout the entire organization. Subsequently, Zhang was able to adopt the energetic, visionary leadership style required to drive changes.\n877u | Organizations that thrive in a VUCA environment make experimentation a way of organizational life. Zhang's stronghold on the company allowed him to keep experimenting and reinventing the company. From the nineteen eighties onward, Zhang took various steps to change the company structure and to mold the organizational culture. In nineteen eighty-nine, Haier introduced the practice of \"overall, every, control, and clear\" (OEC), a Japanese-inspired practice to control \"everything, everyone, and every day\" in order to increase the accountability of all employees and to stimulate them to continually challenge ineffective work practices. Subsequently, Zhang started to slowly move from the traditional hierarchical and siloed structure into a project-based network structure. In nineteen ninety-nine, Haier's organizational structure was entirely transformed into a matrix, consisting of four development divisions and six functional departments with greater decision-making autonomy. Between nineteen ninety-eight and two thousand two, Haier reportedly changed the organizational structure on more than forty occasions. Operating in a context characterized by\nrzhj | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi\nbfax | frequent experimentation with structure made Haier more amenable to later structural changes.\nf2y8 | Leadership. By the mid-two thousands, the Haier Group had become one of the leading white goods companies globally. But Zhang believed that the VUCA environment was a great threat to the existence of traditional companies such as Haier. \"When the world changes, we need to embrace change or we will be eliminated by the changing world,\" he noted on various occasions. Chairman Zhang's key concern was that Haier's successful expansion also reduced its flexibility and the entrepreneurial spirit that was needed to tackle the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous forces that he observed. He told us that he observed a similar pattern in Silicon Valley: \"When enterprises start they are agile, when they become bigger they become less flexible.\" Zhang concluded that Haier needed innovative management practices to strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit and user orientation.\no7qm | Like many other Chinese executives, Zhang initially looked up to western firms and consultants to emulate their management practices. He regularly traveled to the United States and Europe, visited Silicon Valley, and consulted with senior executives at International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard. By two thousand five, Zhang had initiated an HR transformation project in partnership with IBM, an IT transformation project in conjunction with HP, and R and D collaborations with universities such as MIT. At the time, the introduction of performance-based compensation was quite novel for a large Chinese company. But the introduced performance management and communications practices did not move Haier nearly far enough toward Zhang's vision of empowering every employee. \"The traditional methods only cater to the traditional era,\" he remarked.\nd52l | Zhang thought that cutting-edge management practices from some IT firms in Silicon Valley were not necessarily applicable to a global manufacturing company with eighty thousand employees. Conversely, he thought that no large conventional hierarchical firm in the West had yet come up with the sort of radical management practice that he envisaged for Rendanheyi. So, he decided to experiment with introducing different management practices to bring his ideas into reality, looking for inspiration in traditional Chinese writings, management gurus such as Peter Drucker, and new concepts such as quantum theory and \"maker\" culture. While experimenting with new practices, he was driven by an eclectic mix of ideas such as the concept of a \"market chain\" about connecting the company with the market, Peter Drucker's vision about the changing role of employees as \"everybody should become their own CEO,\" and ancient Taoist ideas of Laozi about leadership. Consequently, Rendanheyi became a unique product of different traditions and influences that was essentially driven by one leader.\nqlbb | In February two thousand nine, Zhang first proposed the introduction of ZZJYTs during a performance review for the previous month. Zhang experimented with different ZZJYT setups, not least because there was a perceived lack of collaboration\nnhsg | between ZZJYTs. By the end of two thousand twelve, ZZJYTs and their market chains were grouped into \"communities of common interests,\" which were typically led by the most influential ZZJYTs in the chain. But ZZJYTs did not go far enough toward Zhang's vision for Rendanheyi, and Zhang finally initiated the shift from ZZJYT to xiaowei in two thousand thirteen.\nhy0l | The xiaowei came close to fulfilling Zhang's vision of empowering every employee, but it also conformed to Zhang's acceptance of the ancient ideas of Laozi about true leadership. While Haier uses many different communications channels to convey Zhang's Rendanheyi vision to the employees—the \"Haier University\" training, an internal newsletter, a monthly \"entrepreneurs café,\" and Zhang's personal book recommendations for employees—Zhang believes in Laozi's idea that, ultimately, \"supreme leadership is to make the leader invisible.\" The xiaowei make autonomous decisions without the involvement of the headquarters, like the invisible hand of the market once described by Adam Smith. Quite visibly though, without Zhang's enormous leadership in terms of designing and implementing Rendanheyi, the new management practice would not exist, so we would argue that leadership is the most important factor.\n4jmz | Resources. To complement the changes to the organizational structure, Zhang developed a new corporate culture to support the company's shift toward responsiveness and customer orientation. To encourage simultaneous internal cooperation and competition among the company units, Haier's corporate culture emphasized internal reputation and performance. Backed up by appropriate performance management systems, the company emphasized that the more productive and customer-oriented employees are, the more decision-making autonomy and greater rewards they will receive. The new corporate culture was understandably more receptive to the radical changes in organizational practices in the mid-two thousands.\nb7cq | But beyond employing the organizational culture as a resource, the introduction of a new management system required resources such as consultancy fees, new IT systems, and staff training. More importantly, the performance outcomes of Rendanheyi were totally unknown, and unsuccessful implementation could become a major drain on the company's finances. However, Zhang suggested that Rendanheyi would proceed even if revenues and profits showed signs of weakening.\n0b39 | Fortunately, Zhang did not have to worry about resources or the potential impact on investors when he introduced his new management system in two thousand five. Haier's revenues in the mid-two thousands were soaring, having quadrupled from RENMINBI twenty-seven billion in nineteen ninety-nine to RENMINBI one hundred three billion in two thousand five. And the Haier Group was under partial public ownership, freeing the company from delivering consistent financial returns.\nqecd | The freedom to allocate resources distinguished Haier from western competitors. Indeed, Zhang told us that he specifically discussed the idea of introducing\n1o7p | Management Innovation Made in China: Haier's Rendanheyi",
