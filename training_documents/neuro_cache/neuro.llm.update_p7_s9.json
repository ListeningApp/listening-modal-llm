        "content": "o7qm | A crucial aspect of this logic is that the patterns of activation arising from the two strategies must actually be different. It is not enough to show that, relative to a baseline, in one task areas X-Y are activated, whereas in another task areas P-Q are activated. 'Activation' is a continuous variable, and sub-threshold activation is common. Thus, even though activation in an area might be significant in one task (relative to baseline), and not in another, there might be no difference between the two when they are directly compared. Thus, one must compare the tasks directly, not simply rely on visual comparisons of what was and was not over the threshold under separate conditions.\nd52l | Three. When are specific types of information processing used?\nqlbb | One virtue of beginning by asking questions about how information processing is implemented in the brain is that the answers can later be used as a basis for asking and answering other types of questions. We can distinguish two broad classes of questions that can be asked about when specific processing is used. First, one can ask simply whether a given process or structure was drawn upon\nnhsg | while subjects engaged a particular ability. Second, 'when' need not be a constant: one can ask how practice, fatigue or some other state can alter when a particular process or structure is used. We explore both classes of questions below.\nhy0l | (a) Inferring processes from brain activation\n4jmz | Two distinct types of logic of inference can be used to infer that a particular process or structure is used when subjects perform a specific task.\nb7cq | (i) Inferring processing from the presence of activation\n0b39 | It is commonplace in the discussion sections of neuroimaging studies to see post-hoc interpretations of processing based on the set of areas found to be activated. In the ideal case, if one knows which processes or structures are implemented in a given part of the brain, one can argue subsequently that activation in that area while subjects perform a particular task is prima facie evidence that these processes or structures were drawn upon while subjects performed that task. To the extent that a particular process or structure has been identified with a particular neuroanatomical locus, this logic of inference is defensible. For example, the function of area M one is understood well enough to allow us to infer that if it is activated, then motor processes were present as one performed the task (assuming that it can be shown that the activation is not an artifact of the baseline comparison).\nqecd | For example, it is known, largely from animal research, that the anterior insula is the major cortical recipient of input from the autonomic nervous system. We therefore asked whether visual mental images of strongly aversive pictures could induce such feedback from the body; it is well-known that mental images can engage the autonomic nervous system. Kosslyn et al. asked subjects to visualize either very aversive pictures (e.g. of a baby with a large tumor over one eye, or a battered body) or neutral pictures (e.g. of a truck, a lamp), mostly drawn from Lang's set. PET scanning was conducted while subjects visualized each picture and determined whether a statement was an appropriate description of it; the statements were selected to require imagery to evaluate, and thus to encourage subjects to visualize the pictures (e.g. 'the baby has a tumor over his left eye'). When rCBF in the aversive condition was compared with that in the neutral condition, additional activation was documented bilaterally in the anterior insula, as expected. This led us to infer that images of aversive objects can engage the bodily structures that in turn feed back to activate this area.\n1o7p | We can discover whether the structures or processes implemented in a particular area have a functional role in conferring an ability by studying the effects of disrupting that area. In this case, patients who had damage to areas that have no essential role in the ability of interest would still retain the ability (assuming that they are alert enough to be engaged in the tasks used to assess the ability); similarly, TMS delivered to the area would not disrupt this ability. In contrast, if an area does indeed underlie a particular ability, the ability should be\ncp13 | impaired after both damage to the area and temporary disruption of the area induced by TMS. However, without such data, there is no way to know whether any given area implements a structure of process that contributes to the performance of the task of interest.\nbgre | In addition, a problem with the logic of inferring processing from activation is that a given part of the brain can implement more than one process. This could conceivably be true even for highly constrained sensory and motor cortices; we simply do not know enough to exclude the possibility of multiple roles for any piece of cortical real estate. Thus, the activation of a given brain area does not necessarily implicate specific processes that were previously found to activate it; some other process could in fact be at work. The finding of activation in a particular brain area during a particular task can therefore only be taken as either (i) the basis for the hypothesis that a specific process or structure is at work (to be tested, in part, by observing the effects of disrupting the area), or (ii) one piece of converging evidence for such an inference.\n57lp | (ii) Using variations in activation to predict performance\nukth | A completely different logic of inference can be used to discover whether a specific process or structure contributes to how well one can make use of a specific ability. First, however, it is important to be clear on what question is being asked here. We are no longer asking whether a process or structure (implemented in an area) confers an ability. Instead, we are asking whether variations in the efficacy of a structure or process are related to variations in the performance of the relevant tasks. That is, we can divide processes and structures into two general types. The first type of processes or structures are not taxed by the task, to the extent that, if they function at all, they function well enough to allow one to perform a class of tasks. The second type are the 'rate-limiting steps'. They are taxed when one draws on a particular ability; the more effectively they function, the better one will perform the relevant tasks. By analogy, keys on a keyboard are designed so that minimal strength is required to press them down; therefore, finger strength in excess of this amount is irrelevant (and hence finger strength would be analogous to the first type of process). However, the ease of typing a sequence of letters depends on their arrangement, and setting up motor commands to execute some sequences is difficult; thus, better ability to program complex motor movements will lead to better performance on this task (this is a rate-limiting step).\nkpvt | For example, in the task of Kosslyn et al., subjects were asked to visualize, with eyes closed, capital letters. After four seconds they heard a probe (such as 'straight side') and were to decide, as quickly and accurately as possible, whether the visualized letter had that property. Both response times and accuracy rates were recorded as the subjects performed the task while being PET-scanned. After both behavioral and rCBF data had been collected from sixteen subjects, the rCBF values in each brain were normalized to the same mean. For each brain, we then measured deviations from the mean for each region of interest found previously to be activated during visual imagery. These areas were previously interpreted as implementing the functions",
