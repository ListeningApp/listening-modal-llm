You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

(2011) on the basis of 7 year data from WMAP and astrophysical data from other sources.

This is contrary to out- come of accelerated expansion <LATEX>\left( q < 0 \right)</LATEX> of the Universe ob- tained in earlier sections by using latest data sets of <LATEX>H \left( z \right)</LATEX> and SNe Ia observations.

A similar conclusion on power-law cosmologies was drawn by Kaplinghat et al. (1999). However, in the case at hand, it has been done with updated observational data sets and the constraints have been obtained on both the parameters <LATEX>q</LATEX> and

zlxc | The Hubble parameter <LATEX>H = \dot { a } / a</LATEX> and deceleration parameter <LATEX>q = - \ddot { a } / a H ^ { 2 }</LATEX> are useful geometric parameters in cosmology, which describe the expansion history of the Universe. For instance, <LATEX>H > 0</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( \dot { a } > 0 \right.</LATEX> indicates an expanding Universe while <LATEX>q < 0 \left( \ddot { a } > 0 \right)</LATEX> characterizes an accelerated expansion of the Universe. In order to explain accelerated expansion
k0bw | of the Universe, various dark energy models have been pro- posed in the literature. However, these models encounter degeneracy on the geometric parameters <LATEX>H</LATEX> (involving first time derivative of scale factor) and <LATEX>q</LATEX> (involving second time derivative of scale factor) at the present epoch (Malekjani &
aq5a | Khadom-Mohamaddi 2012). Thus the geometric parameters <LATEX>H</LATEX> and <LATEX>q</LATEX> are not capable of discriminating between different dark energy models and a viable diagnostic tool is required for this purpose. Sahni et al. (2003) proposed a pair of pa- rameters <LATEX>r , s</LATEX> called statefinders as a means of distinguish-
sc5y | ing between different dark energy models. The statefinders involve derivatives of scale factor upto third order and are defined as
0yab | <LATEX>r = \frac { \dot { a } } { a H ^ { 3 } }</LATEX> <LATEX>s = \frac { r - 1 } { 3 \left( q - 1 / 2 \right) } .</LATEX> and '
w95z | The remarkable feature of statefinders is that these pa- rameters depend on scale factor and its time derivatives, and hence are geometric in nature (Sahni 2002). Further, different dark energy models exhibit different evolutionary trajectories in the <LATEX>s \quad - r</LATEX> plane. Moreover, the well known flat ACDM model corresponds to the point <LATEX>s = 0</LATEX> and <LATEX>r = 1</LATEX> <LATEX>i n \quad t h e \quad s \quad - \quad r \quad p l a n e</LATEX> (Alam et al. 2003). These features of statefinders provide an opportunity to distinguish between different dark energy models. The statefinder diagnostic tool has been extensively used in the literature as a means to dis- tinguish between different dark energy models (see Alam et al. 2003; Ali et al. 2010; Malekjani & Khadom-Mohamaddi 2012 and references therein). In what follows, we test the power-law cosmology by statefinder diagnostic tool.
