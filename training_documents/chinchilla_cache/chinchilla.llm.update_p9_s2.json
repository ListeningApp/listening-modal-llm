We test this hypothesis by training a model on the larger end of this range, seventy billion parameters, for one point four trillion tokens, due to both dataset and computational efficiency considerations. In this section we compare this model, which we call Chinchilla, to Gopher and other large language models. Both Chinchilla and Gopher have been trained for the same number of floating point operations but differ in the size of the model and the number of training tokens.\niest | While pre-training a large language model has a considerable compute cost, downstream fine-tuning and inference also make up substantial compute usage. Due to being four times smaller than Gopher, both the memory footprint and inference cost of Chinchilla are also smaller.\ncox8 | Four point one. Model and training details\nppqi | The full set of hyperparameters used to train Chinchilla are given in Table four. Chinchilla uses the same model architecture and training setup as Gopher with the exception of the differences listed below.\noxou | We train Chinchilla on MassiveText, the same dataset as Gopher, but use a slightly different subset distribution, shown in Table A1, to account for the increased number of training tokens.\n495n | We use AdamW for Chinchilla rather than Adam as this improves the language modelling loss and the downstream task performance after finetuning.\nawri | We train Chinchilla with a slightly modified SentencePiece tokenizer that does not apply NFKC normalisation. The vocabulary is very similar, ninety-four point one five percent of tokens are the same as those used for training Gopher. We find that this particularly helps with the representation of mathematics and chemistry, for example.\nbl28 | Whilst the forward and backward pass are computed in bfloat sixteen, we store a float thirty-two copy of the weights in the distributed optimiser state. See Lessons Learned from Rae et al. for additional details.\nd5bz | In Appendix G we show the impact of the various optimiser related changes between Chinchilla and Gopher. All models in this analysis have been trained on TPUv3 and TPUv4 with JAX and Haiku. We include a Chinchilla model card in Table A8.\nap5o | Four point two. Results\n7zvf | We perform an extensive evaluation of Chinchilla, comparing against various large language models. We evaluate on a large subset of the tasks presented in Rae et al., shown in Table five. As the focus of this work is on optimal model scaling, we included a large representative subset and introduce a few new evaluations to allow for better comparison to other existing large models. The evaluation details for all tasks are the same as described in Rae et al.\nmov9 | Four point two point one. Language modelling\nks7m | Chinchilla significantly outperforms Gopher on all evaluation subsets of The Pile, as shown in Figure five. Compared to Jurassic-one, one hundred seventy-eight billion parameters, Chinchilla is more performant on all but two subsets- dm_mathematics and ubuntu_irc- see Table A5 for a raw bits-per-byte comparison. On Wikitext one hundred three, Chinchilla achieves a perplexity of seven point one six compared to seven point seven five for Gopher. Some caution is needed when comparing Chinchilla with Gopher on these language modelling benchmarks as Chinchilla is trained on four times more data than Gopher and thus train/test set leakage may artificially enhance the results. We thus place more emphasis on other\nw1w1 | tasks for which leakage is less of a concern, such as MMLU and BIG-bench along with various closed-book question answering and common sense analyses.\nh8gv | Four point two point two.
