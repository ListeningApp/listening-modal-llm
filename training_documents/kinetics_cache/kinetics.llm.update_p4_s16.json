And the error between true parameters theta true equals the ordered pair Bf true and Bs true and estimated parameters theta est equals the ordered pair Bf est and Bs est is calculated according to:\ngii5 | Error ordered pair theta true and theta est equals the sum of open parenthesis logarithm of Bf true minus logarithm of Bf est close parenthesis squared plus open parenthesis logarithm of Bs true minus logarithm of Bs est close parenthesis squared.\nq5eu | We show the robustness of the inference in the cases of positive, negative, and non-feedbacks, respectively. To explore the robustness of the cell numbers to the inference, we select different sampled cell numbers (two hundred, three hundred, five hundred, one thousand, five thousand) to synthesize data fifty times, and at each time, set thirty different initial points for optimization in each case of feedback forms. The optimization process is the same as the inference process of real data. The same process is used to explore the effects of stochastic losses of mRNA molecules (sensitivity), missing randomly at a certain probability (zero point one, zero point three, zero point five, zero point seven or zero point nine) from sufficient samples (number equals two thousand). The results of inference robustness analysis are illustrated with two different distribution examples in the three cases of feedback forms.\na7ao | Inference evaluation\n29a3 | To assess whether the observed data came from the distribution generated via the parameters inferred by our method, we use goodness-of-fit statistics that obey chi-square distribution of large samples:\nsb1e | Chi-square equals the sum from k equals zero to infinity of the fraction open parenthesis Ok minus Ek close parenthesis squared over Ek,\nw2yn | where Ok is the observed sample number whose mRNA number is k, and Ek is the expected sample number. Note that in some sequencing techniques, the cell samples of scRNA-seq data are not large enough, so it is needed to use the Monte Carlo method to generate the null distribution of chi-square goodness-of-fit test instead of the asymptotic distribution. For each gene, we first generate the same number of samples as that in the observed data from the probability of each point with the inferred parameters and then compute the chi-square sim statistic according to Equation seventeen. After repeating the Monte Carlo simulation procedure for one thousand times, we judge whether the resulting inference is a good fit by comparing X obs squared with the resulting one thousand chi-square sim. The criterion that an inferred parameter is a good fit is that the X obs squared is at least less than five percentage numbers of chi-square sim.\nap6l | Data analysis\niest | scRNA-seq data processing. We utilize the processed scRNA-seq data for ten thousand seven hundred twenty-seven genes of transcriptomes from two hundred twenty-four individual mouse embryonic fibroblasts for each allele (C fifty-seven cross CAST). In that paper, the quantification of gene transcription is based on the Smart-seq two scRNA-seq libraries, and UMI counts is used to reduce the amplification noise. To ensure that the inference process is not hin-\ncox8 | dered by low-quality elements of the data as far as possible, we carry out a certain degree of quality control of the original data. We filter out the genes expressed in less than fifty cells. Also, we filter out the cells expressed in less than two thousand genes. In addition, we filter out the genes whose overall average expression levels are less than two. After these manipulations on each allelic data (C fifty-seven cross CAST), the genes that meet the conditions are combined to facilitate inferences from more adequate samples and give a single-cell expression matrix composed of two thousand one hundred sixty-two genes and four hundred thirteen cells. This treatment is based on the assumption that the distributions of almost all genes for the CAST and c fifty-seven alleles have similar shapes and that the transcriptional dynamic behavior is consistent between alleles for most genes, which is also supported by previous studies. And, we removed the outlier data with the tail five percent of the distribution. In addition, our method can be also applied to any high-quality non-allelic scRNA-seq data.\nppqi | Identification of promoter motif and TSS distribution. The recognition and coordinates of the promoter motifs (TATA box, Initiator, CCAAT box, GC box) are downloaded from the Select/Download Tool of the EPD New database. In order to determine the TSS distribution of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs FANTOM five Cap Analysis of gene expression data is retrieved through the CAGEr R package. After normalization and TSS clustering, TSS distribution is defined as 'sharp' if the promoter width is less than fifteen base pairs (this length is taken as the median of all genes), and as 'broad' otherwise.",
