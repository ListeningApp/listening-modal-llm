You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

Cross sections of the geology and alteration interpreted from drill core (collars shown by circles), seafloor morpholo- gies, and seafloor observations from (A) site C (looking north) and (B) site B (looking north).

li1k | The alteration assemblages vary with location and depth, generally progressing downward from the seafloor in the order montmorillonite/nontronite to nontronite + corrensite, to illite/ <LATEX>s m e c t i t e + p y r i t e ,</LATEX> to illite/smectite + chamosite, to chamosite + corrensite. Footwall breccias from site A are dominated by chamosite + corrensite alteration, with localized illite/smectite + chamosite alteration that varies in abundance over short dis- tances and is interpreted to reflect proximity to inferred synvol- canic faults (Fig. 11A). Alteration at site <LATEX>B</LATEX> is semiconformable, varying downhole from illite/smectite <LATEX>+</LATEX> pyrite, to illite/smectite + chamosite, to chamosite + corrensite (Fig. 11B). Site <LATEX>C</LATEX> is characterized by nontronite near the surface, followed by non- tronite + corrensite and chamosite + corrensite at depth (Fig.
pbea | 12A). Alteration at site D varies from illite/smectite + pyrite near the surface, to illite/smectite + chamosite at depth (Fig. 12B). End-member illite and rectorite is present in all samples from site D, reflecting high temperatures (>220â„ƒ) and a pro- gression from argillic to phyllic alteration at depth (e.g., Inoue et al., 1990). The variations in alteration assemblages identified at different sites along the NS-trending fissure appear to reflect variable thermal gradients and permeability structure.

bfax | A3). The proportion of illite increases progressively down- hole, indicating a process of continuous transformation of smectite to illite (e.g., Inoue et al., 1990). Chlorite may form directly from smectite or through an intermediate corrensite step (e.g., Shau et al., 1990). At Tinakula, chamosite appears before corrensite in the downhole progression of alteration assemblages, suggesting that corrensite is not an intermedi- ate phase. Corrensite appears after illite/smectite, following a transition from illite/smectite + chamosite to chamosite + corrensite. This suggests that corrensite forms as an alteration product of the mixed-layer illite/smectite clays.

In addition, small absorption features are present at 2,350 and 2,450 nm for the white micas. Montmorillonite is distinguished by a narrow and symmetri- cal 2,200-nm feature with a small shoulder on the H2O + OH absorption feature at 1,450 to 1,460 nm. Chlorite is identified by the strong absorption feature at 2,340 nm, the wavelength of which increases from 2,324 nm for Mg-rich compositions to >2,350 nm for Fe-rich compositions. Gypsum is identi- fied by the OH + H2O feature at 1,400 nm, together with the OH feature at 1,800 nm. The alteration mineral assemblages observed in the SWIR analysis progress downhole from smec- tite (montmorillonite/nontronite), to white mica (paragonite

How- ever, SWIR analyses with both montmorillonite and white mica reflect the presence of mixed-layer illite/smectite clays rather than discrete end members, with progressive increases downhole in aluminum content that shift the Al-OH absorp- tion feature to lower wavelengths (e.g., Velde, 1980).
b7cq | Alteration Geochemistry
0b39 | Least altered volcanic rocks from the Tinakula deposit range from basaltic andesite and andesite to dacite, with basaltic andesite most abundant within and near the volcanic cones. Representative whole-rock geochemical analyses of altered volcaniclastic rocks from drill core are given in Table 4, with the associated alteration assemblages indicated. The least altered host rocks, described by Anderson (2018), were iden- tified petrographically by a lack of alteration minerals, loss on ignition (LOI) <1.2 wt %, low base metal values (<183 ppm Cu + Zn + Pb), and no obvious Na2O depletion (>4.0 wt %). Data for the three least altered basaltic andesite samples lie on linear trends, with those for the altered samples in plots of TiO2 versus Zr and TiO2 versus Al2O3 (Fig. 13). Excursions from this linear trend (e.g., Zr >160 ppm at ~1.5 wt % TiO2; Fig. 13A) may reflect variability in the parental rock compo- sitions, as volcanic rocks in this area show progressive frac- tionation from basaltic andesite to andesite (e.g., Anderson, 2018). The concentration ranges of immobile and mobile ele- ments for each alteration assemblage are shown in Figure 14. The narrow range of concentrations of Zr, Y, Sc, Nb, Ti, and Al reflect the fact that these elements are least mobile. Concen- trations of Ba, Si, Al, Fe, S, Mg, Ca, Na, and K show signifi- cant variation, consistent with their inferred mobility during hydrothermal alteration. High Ba, Ca, and S(T) reflect the abundance of barite and anhydrite/gypsum in the samples. High Fe2O3(T) and S(T) are related to pyrite occurrence. Illite- smectite alteration is characterized by relative enrichments in

Immobile element ratios of altered volcanic rocks and least altered precursor (average of three samples, from Ander- son, 2018) showing linear trends of relative mass gains and losses, with increasing alteration intensity reflected by increasing distance from average least altered precursor composition: (A) Zr versus TiO2 and (B) Al2O3 versus TiO2.

cp13 | K2O compared to the least altered basaltic andesite, whereas chamosite + corrensite alteration is dominated by MgO addi- tion. The bulk compositions are transitional between illite/ smectite + pyrite to illite/smectite + chamosite to chamosite + corrensite end members (Fig. 15).
bgre | The chondrite-normalized REE profiles for the altered volcaniclastic rocks and the least altered basaltic andesite samples (Fig. 16) show pronounced positive Eu anomalies, as Eu becomes concentrated in hydrothermal fluids after it is released from plagioclase during water-rock interactions. Smectite-rich assemblages (nontronite/montmorillonite and nontronite + corrensite) show slight REE depletion and have flat profiles. The illite/smectite + pyrite assemblage displays significant light REE (LREE) enrichment and steeper pro- files, whereas the chamosite-rich assemblages (illite/smec- tite + chamosite and chamosite + corrensite) show moderate LREE enrichment and flat profiles. The change in slope of the LREEs during the main stage of alteration (illite/smec- tite + pyrite) relative to the least altered rock indicates strong mobility. In contrast, the heavy REEs (HREEs) have slopes similar to those of the least altered rocks, which indicates that they are immobile during hydrothermal alteration. The HREEs are simply moved up or down relative to the least altered values due to the total mass gain or loss of the rock during alteration.
57lp | Major element mass changes were calculated for all altera- tion assemblages following the single precursor method of MacLean and Barrett (Maclean, 1990; Maclean and Barrett, 1993; Barrett and MacLean, 1999) using the average concen- tration of the three least altered samples as the precursor. In this method, the ratio of the concentration of an immobile element in an altered rock to the concentration of that ele- ment in the least altered precursor is proportional to the total mass change in the rock due to hydrothermal alteration. We used the proportion of the least mobile element, Zr, in the precursor sample relative to the altered sample to calculate
