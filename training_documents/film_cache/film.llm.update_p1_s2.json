No prior knowledge of feminist theory is required, but it is expected that readers will be familiar with the basic language of film form. The intended readers are secondary school and university undergraduate teachers and students of film and media studies. Areas of emphasis include spectatorship, narrative and ideology. Many illustrative case studies are used to offer students an opportunity to consider the connotations of visual and aural elements of film, narrative conflicts and oppositions, the implications of spectator 'positioning' and viewer identification, and an ideological critical approach to film.\n9m8s | The book begins with 'potted versions' of the contributions of two influential authors whose seminal texts have fostered new understanding of gender representation in the visual media - John Berger and Laura Mulvey. The theoretical material will be illustrated with reference to case studies. Explanations of key terminology are included. Each chapter begins with key definitions and explanations of the concepts to be studied, including some historical background, where relevant. A list of practice questions is provided at the end of the book and these could be used for essays or tests.\n893y | Cinematic entertainment is often understood as being neutral with respect to values. As studio boss Sam Goldwyn famously said, 'If you want to send a message, call Western Union.' Many students (and teachers) may feel that cinematic entertainment is generic with respect to gender and values. The trouble with this view is that it prevents us from questioning cinematic practices themselves, under the presumption that any sexist problems lie not in specific institutional practices, but in the uses we make of them, or in the way viewers interpret them. It is rare to find discussions of cinema institutions that pay serious attention to the ideological framework underlying them. But viewers can only interpret or use what is there in the first place.\nfavz | In the nineteen eighties and nineties media scholarship interrogated why some kinds of media representations persist and others are absent. It asked how corporate-owned media created markets and shaped its products, thus contributing to how consumers perceive gender, race or class. Media scholarship attended to the ideologies of media forms. By contrast, the more recent paradigm shift in neoliberal academia has been towards viewing media consumption patterns as indicative of the consumer's intrinsic interests. The belief that consumers are ultra-resilient, unimpregnable and completely free and active in their viewing choices has supplanted the focus on the industrial supply side of the relationship.\n7szx | Limiting the focus of film studies to formal codes and techniques for producing them directs our attention to means and away from an evaluation of ends. I realise that some might see gendered film studies as a controversial attempt to change\nhx9e | an industry that already exists and works very well. Perhaps some pedagogues would prefer film and media studies to be evaluated within their own spheres, acknowledging their economically-proven potential to contribute to public entertainment. Arguments about ends may not seem relevant, but such criticism begs the question because it presupposes that a decontextualised evaluation of cinema is an adequate one. When we attempt to analyse cinematic meanings 'in their own sphere' what we are doing is tacitly and uncritically sanctioning the values' status quo. This seems to fall short of the pedagogue's traditional role of encouraging questioning and critical reflection. Those who control the questions control the answers, and educators should not preclude attempts to frame the issues in alternative and enlightening ways.\nywn2 | A culture is more than its institutions, laws or religious beliefs. It consists in the unspoken assumptions and values of its members. Despite claims to objectivity and value neutrality, the Hollywood film industry has an identifiable 'language' with customs, codes and conventions that have developed over time. Many of these conventions developed historically in the absence, or partial absence, of women as creators. Over time, the cultural habits, norms and values produced through this industry have contributed to fostering a culture of opposition to women's equal participation. Media products come from a culture and reflect its moral norms and values. On the other hand, media products also speak to that culture, either reinforcing and legitimising its norms and customs, or subverting and interrogating them. Movies have the potential to spark the audience's imagination, to arouse or sway its emotions, or to provoke new thoughts and ways of seeing the world.\na63r | Film-makers who attempt to increase women's participation (both in the production process and within media products) might be seen as aspiring to reform the cultural institutions. These efforts range from understanding subtle gender biases in hiring practices, for example, to restructuring the conventional language and codes through which films communicate. This is not to suggest that there is an intrinsic 'male' way of seeing because of some biological perceptual difference in all people of the male sex, or vice versa. The point is not to reify the male way of doing cinema (i.e. proclaim a natural or biological cause for it). This would imply that there is an intrinsically masculine way of 'seeing' or 'representing' the world. Rather it is to interrogate how we arrived at so many assumptions about 'masculinity' or 'femininity' in the first place and to point to a certain bias that any human being has in seeing the world through the prism of their own experiences and their own culture.\ndqvj | If cinema (and television) have been complicit in constructing gender stereotypes, then we can begin to ask by what particular mechanisms it has succeeded in doing so.\nr17u | Pluralists generally do not attend to the ways in which huge multi-national conglomerates control the flow of ideas. They focus instead on the consumer and the audience, emphasising the ability of the consumer to select media products according to their own gratifications and needs. They stress the active role of audiences and reject the idea that audiences might be passively manipulated by media messages. Postmodernists argue that there is a wide proliferation of media products not exclusively under the control of the major conglomerates. They argue that there has been a dissemination of power and ideas due to improved access to technology by ordinary citizens.\n3c47 | However, much evidence supports the (not outlandish) theory that what people are taught by their cultural institutions has enormous effects on the way they see the world. There is now a consensus that exposure to media violence is a risk factor for actual violent behaviour. In two thousand five, the Lancet published a comprehensive review of the literature on media violence to date. The weight of evidence from dozens of studies supported the view that exposure to media violence leads to aggression, desensitisation towards violence and lack of sympathy for victims of violence, particularly in children. The United States surgeon general, the National Institute of Mental Health and multiple professional organisations - including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association - all consider media violence exposure a risk factor for actual violence.\ng345 | The remote Himalayan nation of Bhutan makes an interesting case study. Bhutanese life, which is steeped in Himalayan Buddhism, was transformed dramatically when television was introduced for the first time to this nation in June nineteen ninety-nine. A cable service provided forty-six channels of round-the-clock entertainment. By April two thousand and two Bhutan began to see for the first time a crime wave including burglaries and violence, broken families, school dropouts, and other youth crimes like shoplifting. Many Bhutanese citizens began writing in to the national newspaper, Kuensel, complaining that TV is very bad for the country and attributed these social changes to television.\n```",
