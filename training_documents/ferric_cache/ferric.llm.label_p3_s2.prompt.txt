You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

gy8c | 2A) with optical features that closely resemble the substrate- free ferric resting state (Figure S5), before slowly returning to the original mixture of HS and LS species over the following 40 s (Figure 2B, Figure S5). Analysis of the timecourse for cWP- bound oxy-AspB formation and decay at 440 nm required fitting to a three summed exponential (Figure S6). A single rate of formation ~28.1 <LATEX>s ^ { - 1 }</LATEX> and two decay phases (2.2 and 0.04 s-1) (Table S2) represent the primary decomposition of the oxy-ferrous species to the initial LS-species and the subsequent slower generation of the enzyme-substrate complex. Evaluation of the kinetics of oxy formation and decay with varying <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentrations show that only the first kinetic phase (oxy-formation) is O2-dependent as expected, while the latter phases are independent of <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> concentration (Figure 2C). Further comments on the assignment of each of these phases are provided in the Supporting Information Methods, Figure S7, and Tables S2 and S3.
y4mj | The direct transition of <LATEX>\mathrm { F e } ^ { 3 + }</LATEX> to a pure LS species is atypical for substrate-bound CYPs34-36 and suggests a process that is more complex than autoxidation. Nonetheless, we have previously observed similar behavior in the H2O2-dependent CYP OleT.37 In that case, autoxidation, which ultimately
vpgq | Journal of the American Chemical Society
ousl | furnishes <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> can react with the ferric-heme to initiate catalysis. However, AspB is unable to effectively metabolize cWP using a peroxide-shunt pathway (Figure S8), and the inclusion of catalase did not alter the kinetic behavior for oxy- decomposition, unlike what was found for OleT (Figure S9). Another notable deviation from typical CYP behavior is seen when comparing the decay rates of the oxy-complex for the substrate-bound and free enzyme. In the absence of the substrate, AspB-oxy decays directly back to the ferric resting state (Figure S10). For many CYPs, a bound substrate typically extends the lifetime of the first dioxygen intermediate, occasionally upward of 100-fold, thus allowing second electron transfer event to occur and minimizing the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, there is no significant difference in the decay rate constants for AspB decomposition in the presence or absence of the substrate <LATEX>\left( 2 . 2 \pm 0 . 3 s ^ { - 1 } \right.</LATEX> for substrate-free oxy).
m4ju | N-Methylated Substrate Derivative Stabilizes the Oxy Complex. We synthesized a substrate derivative where the indole nitrogen was methylated, termed N1-methyl cWP (3) (Figure 3A), as computational studies by Sherman and colleagues have suggested that DKP-dimerization by AspB may be afforded by primary indole N-H abstraction.19,23 AspB displayed very similar binding characteristics <LATEX>\left( K _ { D } \right.</LATEX> and maximal spin-state conversion) with (3) (Figure S11). The crystal structure of N1-methyl cWP-bound AspB (PDB: 8TWU) was solved to 1.86 Ã… resolution (Figure S12A, Table S4). As in the crystal structure of AspB bound to cWP (PDB 7S3J), two molecules of (3) are found bound in the active site in close vicinity to the heme cofactor (Figure 3B). The first substrate molecule, shown in blue, displays some minor structural differences from that of the native substrate (Figure S12B). This substrate molecule loses some of the concavity seen with the native substrate, and the DKP nitrogen is no longer within hydrogen bonding distance of the heme propionate group as is seen in the crystal structure with (1). Nonetheless, the introduced methyl-group is oriented ~4 Ã… from the heme-iron in a position that would appear primed for oxidation (e.g., hydroxylation followed by spontaneous demethylation)8 by an activated oxygen species if it was generated. The second substrate molecule, shown in light green, binds very similarly to what was observed in the crystal structure of the native substrate. HPLC characterization of AspB turnover with (3) revealed that the substrate analog was highly inhibitory (Figure 3C) and only produced a very minor amount <LATEX>\left( \sim 2 \right)</LATEX> of a demethylated dimerized product with an <LATEX>m / z = 5 7 9</LATEX> (Figure S13).
a0mb | As AspB appears unable to effectively metabolize the N- methylated substrate despite a similar binding mode, we compared the spectral and kinetic characteristics for oxy-AspB decay in the presence of 3. Dramatically different kinetic behavior was observed, as the oxy-complex decayed directly to a mixture of ferric HS/LS states with a composition that was identical to the resting substrate-bound state (Figure 3D) with clearly defined isosbestic points for the transition. While the formation of AspB-oxy was significantly faster in the presence of 3 (238 s 1) with an on rate for <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> binding ~3-fold higher than with 1 (Figure S14), the decay kinetics were much slower than cWP and dominated by the amplitude of the slow phase. The rates of both decay phases closely resembled formation of the E-S complex monitored at 390 nm (Figure S15, Table S5), unlike what was observed with 1. Thus, alteration of the indole

xagm | Provision of a Second electron Is Not Required for Catalysis. Taken together, the unusual behavior for the decay of the AspB-oxy complex in the presence of 1 as well as the inverse KSIE on product formation prompted us to examine the possibility that the generation of CYP-I may not be required for catalysis. The dithionite-reduced E-S complex was exposed to <LATEX>O _ { 2 } ,</LATEX> and samples were then analyzed for product formation. It is unlikely that excess dithionite would be able to effectively reduce the oxy complex, as CYPs prototypically require an allosteric effector role provided by a biological redox partner for efficient second electron transfer.39,40 Nevertheless, we further excluded this possibility through the removal of excess dithionite by anaerobically desalting the E-S complex following reduction such that only one electron equivalent was provided. Irrespective of this chromatographic step, we observed the efficient formation of a product with identical retention time (Figure 4A), UV-absorption profile and <LATEX>m / z</LATEX> as

uooz | 2 (Figure S16). The addition of catalase or superoxide dismutase (SOD) did not significantly affect the accumulation of product in single-turnover experiments, ruling out that product was formed via a H2O2 shunt pathway or from the reaction of released superoxide to the ferrous enzyme (Figure 4B). Quantitation of the product revealed a highly efficient process, resulting in 0.68 Â± 0.12 molar equivalents of 2 per enzyme, while <LATEX>0 . 1 \pm 0 . 0 2</LATEX> equivalents of <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> per enzyme was also produced (Figure 4B), accounting for nearly all <LATEX>\left( \sim 9 0 \right)</LATEX> of the <LATEX>O _ { 2 }</LATEX> and redox equivalents provided during the experiment. We were unable to observe any product in single-turnover experiments when 3 was used as the substrate, and H2O2 quantitation indicated significantly more H2O2 was generated, consistent with the autooxidation behavior shown in stopped-flow experiments (Figure S17).
pxbq | Evidence for HAT by a CYP Ferric Superoxide. To further probe the nature of the AspB-oxy reaction with the native substrate, we compared the rate of decay of the intermediate under single turnover conditions in stopped-flow experiments in <LATEX>H _ { 2 } O</LATEX> and D2O. As both the DKP and indole N- <LATEX>H</LATEX> protons are exchangeable in solvent, we preincubated the E:S complex in deuterated buffer to achieve deuteration at both sites. We observed a normal solvent kinetic isotope effect <LATEX>\left( k _ { \mathrm { H } } / k _ { \mathrm { D } } \right)</LATEX> of <LATEX>2 . 6 \pm 0 . 3</LATEX> (Figure 5A, Table S6), in stark contrast to

u15r | the inverse KSIE observed when using surrogate redox partners. This implies a change in the rate-limiting step under single turnover conditions and strongly implicates the AspB-oxy species for affecting the N-H(D) cleavage. For comparison, we performed the same experiments with 3 to determine if a KSIE is observed in autoxidation, since it has been suggested that hydrogen bonding may also play a role in the stability of the oxy complex.36,41 However, only minor KSIEs for both phases for autoxidation were observed (KH/kp = 1.3 Â± 0.2 and 1.4 Â± 0.2 for the first and second decay phases, respectively) (Table S7). N-H abstraction by AspB-oxy would provide a proton and electron to form the ferric hydroperoxo complex. Due to the highly transient nature of this intermediate, which has only be observed in CYPs at cryogenic temperatures using cryoradiolysis and calibrated thermal annealing, we were unsurprisingly unable to observe this species in stopped-flow experiments. However, to examine the

d09o | role of the subsequent steps involved in downstream dimerization, we replaced the conserved threonine residue at position 244 with an alanine (T244A), which has been rigorously examined in CYPs to be crucial for maintaining correct protonation of the distal oxygen for efficient O-O bond scission to form CYP-I (Figure 5B).24,43 CYPs that use a ferric peroxo-anion remain functional when the analogous mutation is made.44 Compared to wild-type (WT) AspB, the rate of product formation under multiple turnover conditions is 30- fold slower in T244A (Figure 5C). Consistent with its role in proton-mediated heterolysis, the T244A mutant displays less than 3% coupling of NADPH to the product as compared to 62% in WT (Figure 5D). Furthermore, we were unable to observe any appreciable product formation in single-turnover assays with T244A AspB. This suggests a mechanism by which the conserved threonine in CYP-dimerases retains its canonical role for CYP-I formation and is critical in dimerization steps that occur after initial oxidation.
ylhz | Generalization of a Superoxide-Mechanism to Other CYP DKP Dimerases. Utilizing the enzyme function initiative (EFI) suite of tools, we compared the I-helix sequences of 48 CDPS-associated CYPs (Figure S18). The alcohol residue is highly conserved in these putative CYP-dimerases (typically a Ser), while the acid is replaced with aliphatic residues (typically Val or Ile). This suggests that ferric superoxide reactivity may not be limited to just AspB. To test whether the potential commonality of this mechanism to other types of DKP linkages, we evaluated the metabolic profile of NzeB, which shares ~98% sequence identity to AspB. Using the surrogate redox system, NzeB was found to convert cWP to a mixture of C-C and C-N-linked dimers as previously reported (Figure 6A).18,19 To investigate whether C-C bond formation also

Provision of one reducing equivalent and O2 was sufficient to generate the same ensemble of products as those formed under multiple turnover conditions with surrogate redox partners (Figure 6B, Figure S19).
9d4o | DISCUSSION
cjq2 | Steady-state analysis of product formation by AspB has revealed a significant inverse kinetic solvent isotope effect, implicating the use of an intermediate prior to CYP-I for the initiation of substrate dimerization. The competent formation of aspergilazine A under conditions when a second electron is omitted suggests that only a single reducing equivalent from a

Further support for the reactive nature of a ferric superoxide complex is provided through examination of the single-turnover KSIE of oxy-AspB decay, which reverts to a normal (i.e., kH/kp >1) value due to the suppression of available proton-linked uncoupling pathways.
