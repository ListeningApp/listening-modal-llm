        "content": "7bdk | Subjects were seated in separate cubicles. Some were randomly assigned to the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition N equals thirty-three and others to the no-hypothesis-control clip condition N equals thirty. Because Study five featured a novel open-ended measure, other subjects were randomly assigned to a no-hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition N equals thirty-one. After they watched the bittersweet film, subjects in the bipolarity hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition were asked to describe their emotions. Specifically, the computer provided subjects with the following prompt: \"Emotions can affect language comprehension, so please tell us how you feel right now. Type in how you are feeling and why.\" The prompt was accompanied by a field with a capacity of approximately three hundred words. We gave subjects up to four minutes to respond but, to prevent confabulation, gave them the option to finish early. Subjects then read that we were interested in how any positive and negative emotions they felt \"played out over time\" and that \"what we're really interested in is whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time. Two groups of researchers have spent several years debating whether people can feel happy and sad at the same time.\" They then read that one group's prediction is that people can feel happy and sad at the same time but that\nfim0 | our own group, the Boulder Group, predicts that people cannot feel happy and sad at the same time. So we have predicted that people cannot feel both happy and sad at the same time, but evidence for\nojro | or against our prediction would be interesting, so we'll let the data decide.\nl6t9 | These subjects were then asked to indicate which of Figure six's panels best captured the time course of their emotions. Finally, they were asked whether they had been told that our hypothesis was or was not that people could feel both happy and sad at the same time. Data from the four subjects, twelve percent, who incorrectly thought they had been told that our hypothesis was that people could feel both happy and sad were removed from all analyses.\n1ujy | Subjects in the no-hypothesis-bittersweet clip condition went through the same procedure, except they were neither told nor asked about our hypothesis. Subjects in the no-hypothesis-control clip condition also went through the same procedure, except they watched the control clip and were neither told nor asked about our hypothesis.\nqzor | Results and discussion. The percentage of subjects in each group who reported mixed emotions and simultaneously mixed emotions is shown in Table four. Chi-square tests revealed effects of condition on both measures, chi-squared two, N equals ninety equals nineteen point fifty-seven and sixteen point fifty-eight, Cram√©r's V equals point four seven and point four three, respectively, both P is less than point zero zero one. Follow-up Fisher's exact tests indicated that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip and were told nothing about our hypotheses were more likely than subjects who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions phi equals point five one, P is less than point zero zero one and simultaneously mixed emotions phi equals point four one, P equals point zero zero two. Additional tests indicated that subjects who watched the bittersweet clip and were told that we doubted that people can feel happy and sad at the same time were also more likely than subjects who watched the control clip to report mixed emotions phi equals point five seven, P is less than point zero zero one and simultaneously mixed emotions\na0by | phi equals point five four, P is less than point zero zero one. In sum, individuals who watched the bittersweet clip reported more mixed emotions than those who watched the control clip whether or not they were led to believe that we doubted the existence of mixed emotions. Thus, these data replicate Study four's evidence for mixed emotions and extend them by indicating that subjects pay more attention to reporting their emotions than to speculating about our hypotheses.\nu1ky | Study six: Lay Theories Revisited\nhtm9 | As in Studies one and two, subjects in Studies four and five may have simply reported feeling both happy and sad because they believed that people can feel happy and sad at the same time. To test this hypothesis, we conducted another study that included subjects who did not endorse the belief that happiness and sadness can co-occur. Rather than ask subjects to write about their emotions, we had an interviewer ask them to describe their emotions verbally.\n8hul | Method. Three weeks before the study began, eight hundred fifty-two University of Colorado, Boulder, undergraduates enrolled in introductory psychology courses completed a mass survey. One questionnaire contained the yes-no question \"Do you think people can feel happy and sad at the same time?\" embedded among similar questions about psychological phenomena. Those who said \"yes\" and\n87vz | \"no\" were classified as endorsers N equals seven hundred eighty-nine; ninety-three and nonendorsers N equals sixty-three; seven, respectively.\nl0a3 | A subset of endorsers and nonendorsers were invited to participate in the study N equals seventy-four; thirty-eight women; fifty-one percent. Data from an additional subject were lost because the voice recorder malfunctioned.\nu8nw | Subjects completed the study individually. Because few nonendorsers were available and we thought it unlikely that they would report mixed emotions after watching the control clip, all nonendorsers N equals twenty-eight watched the bittersweet clip. Endorsers watched either the bittersweet Life Is Beautiful clip N equals twenty-two or the control clip N equals twenty-four by random assignment. After providing the cover story, the experimenter left and subjects watched the clip. After the clip, the experimenter told subjects that she needed to ask a few questions about their emotional reactions to the film because emotions can affect language comprehension. She first asked, \"How do you feel right now?\" Throughout, whenever subjects mentioned an emotion, the experimenter asked them to explain why they felt that way if they had not spontaneously done so. If they mentioned positive or negative emotions only in response to the first question, she asked, \"Do you feel anything else?\" At this point, the experimenter confirmed any reports of mixed emotions by asking, \"So you feel happy and sad?\" (When applicable, the experimenter replaced \"happy\" and \"sad\" with the positive and negative emotions mentioned by the subject.) No subjects who initially reported mixed emotions subsequently denied them.",
