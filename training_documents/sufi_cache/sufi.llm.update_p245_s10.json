If, on the other hand, I import something of use, like wool, from a place where it grows to a place where it can be used, I am probably doing something useful.\npis5 | It is a sad commentary on the primitive state of thinking upon this matter that people try to safeguard their existing ways by excluding things which are of use and including things which are useless.\nwzbn | The difficulty on the part of the ordinary man to know what is useful and what is merely secondary, cultural material, is in part due to his impatience and greed - he wants anything that might be useful, or is attractive in part due to the fact that nobody has told him the elementary fact that certain things are not only useful but essential imports, and partly due to the fear that something brought into his life or thinking from another source might not suit him.",
