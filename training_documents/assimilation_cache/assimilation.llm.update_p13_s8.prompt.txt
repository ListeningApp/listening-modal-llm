You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

For <LATEX>t > 1 . 5</LATEX> or so, the ensemble mean is seen to differ dramatically from the true solution. The specific reason in this case is that trajectories from the ensemble switch from one leaf of the attractor to the other at times that can be very different from <LATEX>t = 2 .</LATEX> Essentially, if the initial data are known only up to random errors that have standard normal distributions, then the true trajectory becomes unpredictable for <LATEX>t > 1 . 5</LATEX> or so. Averaging over many ensemble trajectories does not eliminate this bias. This situation is typical for nonlinear systems of differential equations; for linear systems, the ensemble mean always equals the true trajectory.
i9k5 | Figure 20.5 again shows the x-component of the true trajectory, together with the corresponding results of the EnKf, for a ensemble of size 50. The data model is given by Eq. <LATEX>\left( 2 0 . 1 7 \right) ,</LATEX> with <LATEX>H = \left( \begin{array}{} { 1 } & { 1 } & { 0 } \\ { 0 } & { 1 } & { 1 } \end{array} \right)</LATEX> Therefore, only a two-dimensional projection of the true trajectory, corrupted by random noise, is observed at each time.

Evidently, the assimilation processes is only partially successful in approximating the correct trajectory. For example, on the intervals <LATEX>1 . 5 < t < 2</LATEX> and <LATEX>4 . 5 < t < 5 ,</LATEX> the assimilated trajectories are not even qualitatively correct. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that a significant portion of the true trajectory is recreated correctly over the entire interval of interest.

htre | 20.9 - Concluding Remarks
da3c | Data assimilation has been very important for weather prediction, where it has extended both the range and reliability of forecasts. In the best-case scenario, there is a correct dynamical model with sufficiently high resolution and a well-designed observational net- work that can provide accurate data. In the next-best-case scenario, there may be a some- what deficient dynamical model, but the observational network is still good enough to provide adequate data. Then it is still possible to obtain estimates in agreement with na- ture, as long as dynamical model errors are recognized and incorporated adequately.
890q | In climate science, data assimilation has been used since the late 1980s. It is having an increasingly significant impact, since it allows improved and faster estimation of both internal and external parameters. Parameter estimation is particularly promising in the biogeochemistry of the climate system, where it is often difficult to measure rates directly in situ. Realistic dynamical models and feasible measurements of quantities such as con- centration fields of plankton, in combination with advanced data assimilation techniques, can lead to surprisingly realistic estimates of these rates.
jomo | Data assimilation techniques have been applied to create reliable uniform background data for the past (reanalysis) and to obtain information about unobservable quantities such as ocean upwelling and chemical reaction rates in the ocean. A typical example is described in [11], where an EnKf approach is used to reconstruct the ocean climate for the period 1958-2001.
06fi | Interestingly, there are specific problems with heterogeneous data sources associated with all reanalysis exercises for ocean circulation for the 20th century. Since about 1980, satellites with circumpolar orbits have provided reliable records of planet-wide uniformly distributed ocean measurements. But prior to about 1980, observations came mainly from shipboard observations that were concentrated along major shipping routes. There are also other more subtle trends in the data collection efforts that are known to introduce spurious trends during data assimilation. For example, the typical height at which ship- board anemometers are mounted has increased since the middle of the last century, leading to biased results for wind strengths and patterns. In the past, when data assimilation was used mainly for weather prediction, such slow trends did not matter.
hb4s | Ridgwell et al. [88] describe a similar project for biogeochemistry data. Here, an EnKf is employed in an iterative fashion to obtain steady-state information about geochemical parameters such as uptake rates and concentrations of phosphate and calcium carbonate in the ocean at preindustrial times.
cqq2 | The EnKf is known to run into problems when the underlying process model is highly nonlinear and has many unstable equilibria. Other methods have been proposed for such situations. For example, Apte, Jones, and Stuart [2] develop a Bayesian approach to ad- dress data assimilation questions coming from drifting buoys, which are known to have trajectories that are very sensitive to changes in the initial data.
