The goal here is to push your limits and jog your brain into thinking of a different version of the solution you'd normally default to. This is where you get to flex your entrepreneurial creativity.\n84li | Reminder: You only need to do this once. Literally one time for a product that may last years. This is high-value, high-leverage work. You ultimately get paid for thinking. You got this. This should be fun. Go ahead and list out all your possibilities now. Then I'll take you through my example. I'll just use the buying food problem from earlier as an example. I like to group things by how many people I'm going to deliver this thing to at once.\noh1c | My list is below. And at the bottom, I've given you my \"cheat codes\" for how I think through this to get even more creative.\napax | Problem: Buying Healthy Food Is Hard, Confusing, and I Won't Like It\nzc7j | If I wanted to provide a one-on-one solution I might offer . . .\n96pn | One. In-person grocery shopping, where I take clients to the store and teach them how to shop\ntxea | Two. Personalized grocery list, where I teach them how to make their list\n8oh3 | Three. Full-service shopping, where I buy their food for them. We're talking one hundred percent done for them.\nm27u | Four. In-person orientation (not at store), where I teach them what to get\ns0b6 | Five. Text support while shopping, where I help them if they get stuck\nihlu | Six. Phone call while grocery shopping, where I plan to call when they go shopping to provide direction and support\nr3zr | If I wanted to provide a small group solution I might offer . . .\nj6ku | One. In-person grocery shopping, where I meet a bunch of people and take them all shopping for themselves\nzt0d | Two. Personalized grocery list, where I teach a bunch of people how to make their weekly lists. I could do this one time or every week if I wanted to.\nej0q | Three. Buy their food for them, where I purchase their groceries and deliver them as well\ndg44 | Four. In-person orientation, where I teach a small group offsite what to do (not at store)\nlhtj | If I wanted to provide a one to many solution I might offer . . .\nns07 | One. Live grocery tour virtual, where I might live stream me going through the grocery store for all my new customers and let them ask questions live\nq8bx | Two. Recorded grocery tour, where I might shop once, record it, then give it as a reference point from that point onwards for my clients to watch on their own\nlftq | Three. DIY grocery calculator, where I create a shareable tool or show them how to use a tool to calculate their grocery list\nhyaf | Four. Predetermined lists, where each customer plan comes with its own grocery list for each week. I could make this ahead of time so they have it. Then they could use it on their own time\n9etn | Five. Grocery buddy system, where I could pair customers all up, which takes no time really, and let them go shopping together\n2bic | Six. Pre-made, insta-cart grocery carts for delivery, where I could pre-make insta-cart lists so clients could have their groceries delivered to their doorstep with one click\njras | As you see, the list can really go on and on here. This is just to illustrate the many ways to solve a single problem. Now do this for all of the perceived problems that your clients encounter before, after, and during their experience with your service/products. You should have a monster list by the end of this.\ndwvf | Product Delivery Cheat Codes\nic87 | What's that? You're having trouble being creative? I'm going to give you the cheat codes right now, kind of like I did with the brick example: \"the brick could be gold, or plastic, or have holes in it, or be a lego, etc.\" Here are my \"cheat codes\" for product variation/enhancement and a visual to break down the process for you from my consulting deck:\nbxpw | Delivery Cube\n4g09 | I-I, Small Group, I-Many\ntxr8 | Consumption\nrsup | LIVE\nhk1c | Speed and Convenience\nna8b | DIY-Do it with them-Done for you\na4wk | Monday-Friday?\nbi02 | Twenty-four seven Nine-five\nyc23 | DIY\nki0m | Ten X and one tenth Test\n6wrx | Support\nu4q7 | X\njd7m | Ten X or\nsknv | SMS\nusuw | IOX ACQUISITIONIM\nd4hr | One. What level of personal attention do I want to provide? one-on-one, small group, one to many\nph8j | Two. What level of effort is expected from them? Do it themselves - figure out how to do it on their own; do it with them - you teach them how to do it; done for them - you do it for them\nbemf | Three. If doing something live, what environment or medium do I want to deliver it in? In-person, phone support, email support, text support, Zoom support, chat support\ns9l9 | Four. If doing a recording, how do I want them to consume it? Audio, video, or written.\nbs07 | Five. How quickly do we want to reply? On what days? during what hours? twenty-four seven. nine-five, within five minutes, within an hour, within twenty-four hours?\ny6eq | Six. Ten X to one tenth test. If my customers paid me ten times my price (or one hundred thousand dollars) what would I provide? If they paid me one tenth the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that? How could I still make them successful for one tenth price? Stretch your mind in either direction and you'll come up with widely different solutions.\n0tl4 | In other words, how could I actually deliver on these solutions I am claiming I will provide. Do this for each problem because solutions from one problem will give you ideas for others you wouldn't normally have considered.\nvbq2 | Remember, it's important that you solve every problem. I can't tell you the amount of times one single item becomes the reason someone doesn't buy.\npfrt | Anecdote: Why We Must Solve Every Perceived Problem\niws8 | One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn't work for her because she went out to eat for lunch every day. Normally, I would have lost this sale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded \"I'll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat out one hundred percent of the time and still hit your goal. How does that sound?\" She agreed, and I closed the sale.\nn452 | I took the time to make an eating out guide for her. But from that point going forward, whenever someone said \"but what about eating out?\" I had the solution. Over time, I continued solving obstacles with templates and trainings until there were no more \"one things\" to prevent my sales. This lesson has stuck with me to this day. Don't get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that's so good, people just can't say no. And that's what we're building here.\nztct | Note: You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people. That's not to say that if you don't, you won't sell people. Not at all. But you won't sell as many people as you otherwise could have. And that's the goal, to sell the most people, for the highest possible price, with the highest possible margin.\nenir | Step five: Trim and Stack",
