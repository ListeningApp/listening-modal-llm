        "content": "gqd8 | In addition to Cleveland and McGill, who were statistical scientists (and later professors) focused on researching how we process visual cues, Stephen Few has written extensively on this topic in his books and on his blog.\netr7 | The authorities on this matter have concluded that the human brain correctly perceives numerical values in a way that is different from how it perceives various visual primitives.\n3m6c | Chapter Four\nh1un | In the descending order of accuracy, visual primitives are as follows:\nnljo | Position: This shows how marks relate to an axis, like in a scatter plot.\nookx | The bar or line length: This is why line graphs and bar graphs remain the first and the most popular forms of data visualization.\n0h9f | Angle: This should be used sparingly, as the human brain actually is not good at differentiating angles within a circle. Pie charts are effective if you wish to communicate measures as long as about five dimensions are included and the slices are labeled with their respective percentages of the whole.\na5nf | Area: It's actually fairly difficult for us to differentiate numerical values from each other based on the size of a shape. Therefore, you should use bubble graphs and tree maps sparingly and label them properly when you do use them.\nhtog | Saturation and hue: These are the worst primitives that you can use to encode numerical values because not only are a significant number of readers color-blind, but also they are used inconsistently and designed for perception rather than judging.\nd9zz | Color: This is best used for categorization into groups rather than to measure quantity. However, you can use it effectively in heat maps and highlight tables, as long as you are using it properly and labeling the values.\neovv | Your mileage may vary, but consider the hierarchy of visual clue perception carefully. Some conservative data authors will try to stick to scatter plots, line charts, and bar charts (and their derivative chart types) almost exclusively and avoid most other charts such as pie charts, bubble charts, and heat maps.\nf6vi | Leveraging your understanding of how our brains interpret visual clues will help you select the proper chart type. Fortunately, there is a built-in assistant in Tableau Public called Show Me that will help you choose a chart type based on the data elements (measures and dimensions) that you select.\nqt9q | Visualization - Tips and Types\nfkn1 | Tableau Public has a great tool embedded into the software called Show Me (or the Show Me button). This tool is an expression of Tableau Software's vision of self-service analysis because it allows largely nontechnical users to develop useful graphs and charts based on their data. The Show Me button is at the top right-hand side of the Tableau Public interface. Clicking on this button opens the Show Me dialog box (with twenty-four chart type icons in Tableau Public nine.x), as seen in the following screenshot:\nxqgo | The Show Me tool suggests graph types based on the view that the user has created and/or the fields that the user has selected from the Data window or the shelf areas.\nztv3 | Only the graph icons that fit the data types available or selected are enabled. For example, none of the geographic maps on icon row number two are enabled, because there is no geographic data in the data set used to make this screenshot.\nd6tt | The Show Me tool also tells you which additional field types you need to select in order to create a specific visualization, which is a great way to learn.\now58 | To use the Show Me tool, select one or more dimensions or measures from the Data window and then click on the Show Me button in the upper right of the Tableau window to see the suggestions in the Show Me dialog box. The following are some examples:\nrhnw | Chapter Four\n78ub | Selecting a continuous date field will prompt the suggestion of a line graph.\n49qz | Selecting a geographical field will prompt the selection of a map.\nvw2p | You can't auto-hide the Show Me dialog box once it is displayed and the user has made a selection from it. Click on the Show Me button again to hide the Show Me dialog box.\njkfz | In addition to creating new visualizations using the Show Me card, you can modify the existing graph. When you select a new graph type from one of the highlighted buttons, Tableau Public will change your visualization for you, and by doing so, it might remove fields on the visualization that aren't part of the new one.\n1jrv | Show Me contains twenty-four chart types in Tableau Public nine.x, but many more advanced or customized charts can also be created by adding different data elements and tweaking the existing chart that you have built. Items that help users better understand the data include tool tips, trend lines, color indicators, row separators, and reference lines. We will explore these additions in detail later in the chapter.\nurci | Answering questions using Show Me chart types\nzrmd | Of the many chart types available in the Show Me tool in Tableau Public nine.x, there are several common chart types that are frequently used - tables, line charts, bar charts, geographic maps, and scatter charts. Pie charts are often used in popular culture, particularly in infographics, but you should use them sparingly and always label the slices with the percent of the total.\nvret | Charts and graphs exist to answer questions, and some charts can naturally answer certain types of questions better than other charts.\nurmw | The following sections discuss in detail some important chart types offered in Tableau Public, but this is not a comprehensive list due to limitations pertaining to space in this book. In order to help you learn how to construct different visualizations, the screenshots in these sections include the placement of different fields on the shelves and cards of the workspace.\nhqf9 | Visualization - Tips and Types\n7ahf | About dimensions and measures\n1lig | In Chapter Three, Connecting to Data, we discussed dimensions and measures in detail. Let's bring up a few more points so that we understand the chart creation process a little better. Tableau Public separates data source into dimensions (qualitative fields) and measures (quantitative fields).\npr1i | When you drag a field onto a worksheet, its new instance is called a pill. The dimensions and discrete fields will be blue, while continuous measures will be green pills. Each of these pills has a right-click on the shortcut context menu and can have icons on them that correspond to the Marks card shelves that they belong, to as well as the set and group icons (if they are part of a group or set).\n7k5c | When we use a dimension, Tableau Public creates column or row headers for a chart (view). On the contrary, measures typically create an axis in the chart in case the measure is classified as continuous, as described in the next section of this chapter. Measures can be aggregated (mathematical calculations such as summation, averaging, counting, and so on) based on the selected aggregation function (SUM, AVG, COUNT, and so on) for each item in the dimension used in the chart.\n14m3 | Tableau Public automatically determines whether a data field is a dimension or a measure, but sometimes, the software makes mistakes. For instance, if your data source has numeric unique identifiers, such as account numbers, then they will be grouped as measures by default, unless the field name contains the ID string. In this case, you can change a data element to either a dimension or measure by dragging it to the correct pane in the Data window (to the Dimensions pane or the Measures pane). It is more likely that you will have to convert measures into dimensions (because all numeric values are not measures). To convert a measure into a dimension, you can either drag it to the Dimensions pane or right-click on the measure and select Convert to Dimension from the shortcut context menu. If this conversion is needed for only one chart, you can locally convert the measure on a shelf in the same manner (by selecting the Convert to Dimension command from the shortcut context menu).\n8bf1 | Continuous and discrete dimensions and measures",
