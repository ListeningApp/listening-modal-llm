This type of smoothing retains the original spatial resolution, but tends to improve classification predictions by decreasing the impact of meaningless local variation, instrument noise, and small shadows. We initially processed layers at several smoothing distances (zero point five meters, zero point seven five meters, one meter, one point two five meters), but we only retained layers that appeared important in preliminary models and had a Spearman correlation less than zero point ninety-five at the reference plot locations. Once the layers were prepared, the values of all predictor layers at the location of each reference plot were extracted for model training and validation.\nb780 | Two point five. Random forest modeling\nccmb | Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses ensembles ('forests') of classification or regression trees. In a Random Forest, each tree selects and permutes random subsets of predictor variables at each splitting node, which reduces overfitting and improves the strength of predictions. Additionally, Random Forest is non-parametric, models local interactions naturally, and is relatively robust against the collinearity common to ecological variables, making it an effective tool for ecological research.\nma93 | We implemented Random Forest using the package 'randomForest' along with model training tools in the package 'caret' in the R statistical language. Twenty-five percent of the reference data plots (selected proportionally from each class; one hundred ninety-six plots total)\nc6hh | a Smoothing, summing, and standard deviations were performed using ArcGIS Focal Statistics in Spatial Analyst via arcpy in Python.\ny7ea | b Canopy and terrain heights estimated from lidar as described in Greaves and others.\nnav4 | c Calculated from RGBN imagery via the 'raster' package in R.\ngem8 | e Hue derived from RGBN imagery via ENVI.\ne8nr | f Raw intensity gridded using LAStools.\nk78w | g Implemented in SAGA GIS via the 'RSAGA' package in R.\ng9du | were withheld from model building to be used as a test dataset; the remaining seventy-five percent of the plots were used to build the model. One model was built to predict all three footprints.\nf682 | Because the Random Forest algorithm strives to produce the best overall accuracy, it is susceptible to producing poor accuracy for small classes in imbalanced datasets. Since our input dataset was imbalanced, we used an upsampling algorithm implemented in the caret package to ensure equal weighting of each class. The model building was an iterative process: we used out-of-bag error rates and confusion matrices from early models to determine which classes could not be differentiated, then collapsed input classes accordingly and retrained the model, seeking a balance between accuracy and retention of informative classes. The final class names and reference plot membership counts are in table three. We also used tools in the caret package to tune the number of trees and the number of variables selected for splitting at each tree node based on five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. We found that any number of trees greater than five hundred and any value of mtry less than approximately six gave largely similar results. The final model used one thousand one trees and an mtry of one.\nli1k | Two point six. Mapping\npbea | After building the final Random Forest model, we applied it across the three data collection footprints using the AsciiGridPredict tool in the R package 'yaImpute'. Once the initial maps were built,\nccpt | pixels in class patches smaller than twenty-five pixels (one square meter) were replaced by the surrounding majority class; therefore, while the map spatial resolution is twenty centimeters, the minimum mapping area is one square meter. Queen-related pixels (pixels touching only at one corner) were considered to be connected to each other, so one square meter patches may not appear as cohesive blocks. Minor manual cleanup was performed to correct pixels where infrastructure had been classified as vegetation on the Toolik Field Station gravel pad. Some misclassifications of other infrastructure on the landscape, such as boardwalks, remain uncorrected but are apparent to the human eye.\n0fpw | To evaluate the accuracy of the map, we extracted the final mapped class at the location of each withheld test plot. From these mapped locations, we determined the overall accuracy, balanced accuracy, Cohen's kappa, and Cohen's weighted kappa. Like Cohen's kappa, Cohen's weighted kappa quantifies the overall agreement after accounting for agreement occurring by chance, but it also permits the investigator to subjectively indicate the degree of disagreement present. Given that vegetation classes are discrete labels that represent gradients of species abundance and structure, and given that our class labels were highly granular, it is reasonable to treat some disagreements as more or less serious in this way. For example, in most applications it would be considerably less serious to confuse Tussock Tundra with Shrubby Tussock Tundra than to confuse it with Tall Shrub. Detailed descriptions of the classes are in table S3.\ndqn8 | Three. Results and discussion\ncop0 | Three point one. Model and map accuracy\nlhkq | Random Forest upsampled out-of-bag overall accuracy was zero point eighty-six, with a kappa of zero point eighty-five and weighted kappa of zero point ninety-one. Based on extraction of final mapped classes for withheld test plots, overall map accuracy was zero point fifty-two, and balanced (mean class-wise) map accuracy was zero point fifty-seven. Kappa was zero point forty-seven for the mapped withheld plots, indicating moderate agreement. Weighted kappa was considerably higher (zero point sixty-five), suggesting that many disagreements were relatively minor in an ecological sense. The confusion matrix shows that the main confusion was among shrubby classes and among moist upland classes, which was expected because these classes grade into each other on the landscape. Mean user's accuracy was slightly higher than mean producer's accuracy (zero point sixty-three versus zero point fifty-seven). The confusion matrix also illustrates that although the withheld test data represented twenty-five percent of all reference data, the imbalanced class sizes led to very small withheld sample sizes for small classes (as small as four members, mean thirteen); this makes the accuracy metrics more difficult to interpret, since there were relatively few opportunities to test accuracy in these smaller classes.\n82ju | Three point two.
