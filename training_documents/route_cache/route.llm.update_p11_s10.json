The crude product was purified by column chromatography (eluent: hexane/acetone equals three to one) to afford a yellow pale solid (forty-one milligrams, seventy-two percent yield): one H NMR (CDCl3, four hundred point one three megahertz, eight) seven point seven four to seven point six eight (multiplet, two H), seven point five seven to seven point five three (multiplet, two H), seven point three three to seven point two seven (multiplet, five H), seven point zero eight to seven point zero five (multiplet, two H), six point six three to six point five seven (multiplet, two H), five point five eight (singlet, two H, CH two), two point nine eight (singlet, six H, N(CH three) two); thirteen C{one H} NMR (CDCl3, one hundred point six megahertz, eight) one hundred thirty-six point eight (quintet), one hundred thirty-four point eight (quintet), one hundred thirty-three point zero (triplet), one hundred thirty-two point seven (triplet), one hundred thirty-one point eight (quintet), one hundred thirty-one point one (quintet), one hundred twenty-nine point nine (triplet), one hundred twenty-nine point two (triplet), one hundred twenty-eight point seven (triplet), one hundred twenty-seven point one (triplet), one hundred eighteen point two (quintet), one hundred thirteen point five (quintet), one hundred eleven point eight (triplet), one hundred eight point five (quintet), ninety-five point seven (quintet), seventy-six point four (quintet), fifty-two point nine (singlet), forty point two (pentet); IR (centimeter to the negative one) nu two thousand two hundred twenty-three (C equals C, C equals N); HRMS ESI C twenty-six H twenty-one N five N four hundred twenty-six point one six eight nine, found four hundred twenty-six point one six eight nine.
