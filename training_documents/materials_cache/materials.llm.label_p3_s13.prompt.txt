You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

bqfb | Most of random initial structures are infeasible solu- tions, and the analytic optimization methods such as the steepest-descent method cannot escape from the infeasi- ble solution to a feasible solution. Therefore, we period- ically update the values of d(min) and d(max) depending on the network of CBs that are also renewed periodi- cally. The network is determined from the maximization problem of the number of CBs given by

ccpt | where 0 < E; is the fixed bonding affinity, nijT (CBA) is the number of common bridging atoms between the pair of atoms i and jT, N.(CBA) is the default maximum num- ber of common bridging atoms defined in Eq. (18), and q is an index for selecting ni indices of anions jT ran- domly. The third constraints define the formation ranges of CBs. The fourth constraints force cations to create CBs with the nearest ni anions. The optimization prob- lem can be solved as follows: First, all the cations create as many CBs as possible with neighboring anions, and seconds, we erase CBs with maximizing the object func- tion of Eq. (17) until all the number of common bridging atoms satisfy the second constraints. Note that two poly- hedra are linked by sharing a common vertex, a common edge, or a common face that corresponds to sharing one, two, or more than two common bridging atoms, respec- tively [24].
0fpw | To find the optimal solutions, we solve the problems of Eqs. (2) and (17) alternately. The optimization scheme is shown in Fig. 2. A random initial structure can be infeasible solution, in fact, not all cations may not be surrounded by oxygen ions and may not have desirable coordination numbers. Besides, even if all the atoms have the desirable coordination numbers, the structure does not necessarily satisfy all the geometrical constraints such as the maximum number of common bridging atoms. Therefore, the global geometrical optimization is aimed at transforming the structure largely enough to create a different network of CBs by large Axmax. After the small number of global geometrical optimization steps,

k16v | we solve the problem of Eq. (17) once again to update the network of CBs. The mutable network and the other ge- ometrical constraints assist cations making coordination polyhedra, and accordingly, the structure is transformed into a feasible solution. If the structure satisfies the con- dition of Eq. (15), the structure is locally optimized by small Axmax to identify whether the structure can be the optimal solusion of the geometrical optimization problem given by Eq. (2). If so, the structure is the optimal so- lution of the paired optimization problems. If not, the structure is globally optimized again after annealing. The parameters of global and local optimization are detailed in Supplementary Information [33].
b2lm | To estimate the number of optimal solutions and coarsely classify the optimal solutions, we define a struc- tural fingerprint as the bundle of the fingerprints by the lists of geometrical constraints (LGCs) in dictionary or- der. LGCs are defined as what kinds of geometrical con- straints are formed with the adjacent atoms. The fin- gerprint of LGC enumerates the element symbols of the adjacent atoms linked by CBs, PCs, and ACs in dictio- nary order, respectively. Note that there is a possibility that the same structure fingerprint is assigned to differ- ent structures. For example, the fingerprint for the rutile structure and a-PbO2 is the case. See also Supplemen- tary Information [33].
ti7f | The paired mathematical programming approach is aimed at showcasting capabilities of simple rules to search structural prototypes of crystals. In this study, we in- troduce 11 kinds of cations shown in Table II to repro- duce a wide variety of coordination polyhedra. The 11 cations are selected by considering closed packed poly- hedra consisting of the centered cation and surround- ing oxygen ions, and defined by r(I), R(I), N(CB), and N(CBA), where N(CBA) is the default maximum number of common bridging atoms. We determine N(CBA) in the second constraint of Eq. (17) as

o22k | Cationic radius Cn (n € N) corresponds to the mini- mum radius so that the cation can connect n oxygen ions, while CO correponds to the ionic radius of oxygen ion. They are given in Supplementary Information [33]. If the minimum and maximum cationic radii are the same, the cation is a hard sphere; if not, the cation is a soft sphere,
nwfz | TABLE II. 11 kinds of cations. Cn (n E N) corresponds to the minimum radius so that the cation can connect n oxygen ions, and CO corresponds to the ionic radius of oxygen ion. The values of the radii are listed in Supplementary Informa- tion [33]. A symbol represents the atomic radius and/or the maximum number of common bridging atoms. For example, the minimum and maximum cationic radii of the cation Op are C7 (sePta) and Cs (Octa), respectively, while the max- imum number of common bridging atoms Ht is three (Tri). The color is given if the cation is illustrated in Figures.
nvfy | because the bonding lenths can vary within the two radii.
mror | We apply our mathematical programming model to several compositions of cations, and find that a wide va- riety of real crystals are discovered in the optimal solu- tions by the paired mathematical programming. Table III shows the number of discovered optimal solutions for each composition, which seems to be much smaller than the number of local minima in the total energy by ab- initio simulations, and corresponding real crystals found in them. We discuss here results by focusing on aspects of the generated coordination polyhedra.
zlxc | The optimal solutions of HtyTmOn form a wide variety of linked-polyhedra composed of tetrahedra and octahe- dra as shown in Fig. 3. The cations T and Ht are placed in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively, in the Barrow-packings consisting of oxygen ions. Many structures are rejected from the optimal solutions by the constraints of the maximum number of common bridging atoms of T. The spinel structure has the lowest number of LGCs and highest symmetry, found as one of the opti- mal solutions for both the Ht4T208 and Ht& T4016, while the Ga2O3 structure, which is composed of 5 LGCs with the C2/m symmetry, has more LGCs and lower symme- try than the structure shown in Fig. 3(d). Real crystal structures are not necessarily the optimal solution com- posed of the lowest number of LGCs and highest sym- metry, however, they are generally good indicators to assess expectations of the structures to be realized by real crystals. The optimal solution shown in Fig. 3(c) is similar to the crystal structure of Li2 WO4; the differ- ence comes from the sizes of the unit cells. The crystal structure of Li2 WO4 is composed of large tetrahedra and octahedra around lithiums, but this structure may be re- produced by using cations Ht and T, which are placed

sc5y | All the optimal solutions of D4Ht4O12 correspond to the real crystals shown in Figs. 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), and 4(d). The cation D makes coordination polyhedra of antic- uboctahedron or cuboctahedron. Besides, we find that D3Ht6O15 has the optimal solution corresponding to the BaTi2O5 structure shown in Fig. 4(f). The optimal so- lution consists of 11 LGCs, but we find another optimal solution consiting of only 5 LGCs with the Cmmm sym- metry shown in Fig. 4(e).
0yab | Our results indicate that De4Ht208 and DegHt4016 have only one optimal solution corresponding to the crys- tal structure of La2-zSr2 CuO4 as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The cation De makes coordination polyhedron of capped square antiprism. Besides, our calculations indicate that D1De2Ht2O7 and D2De4Ht4O14 also have a unique op- timal solution corresponding to the crystal structure of La2-zSr1+2 Cu2O7 which consists of three kinds of coor- dination polyhedra as shown in Fig. 5(b).
