You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

e8nr | GAP models for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were developed and were efficiently used in simulative selection. Fivefold cross-validation showed the prediction accuracy was 0.5541 and 0.6018 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. The predictability of these models was not only better than that of the activator-depleted substrate model (van der Sman and Sanders, 2012), but also better than that of pure GS by ridge regression BLUP, the accuracy of which was more than 0.4 for apple firmness after storage and was 0.08-0.45 for changes in fruit firmness (McClure et al., 2018). The improvement in predictability of the GAP models may be attributed to the taking into account non-additive allelic effects. Additive, dominant, and even over-dominant non-allelic epistasis or interactions among

g9du | QTLs or candidate genes for fruit firmness were detected in tomato (Causse et al., 2007; Chapman et al., 2012). Dominant or partially dominant allelic effects were common in this study for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability.
f682 | Conclusion
li1k | Fifty-six candidate genes for apple flesh firmness and crispness retainability were predicted from the intervals of 62 QTLs. GAP models were developed using genotype effects of the QTL-based marker, and the prediction accuracy of the GAP models was 0.5712 and 0.6585 for the retainability of flesh firmness and crispness, respectively. On the QTL hotspot of chromosome 3, an 8-bp deletion in the MdERF3 promoter perturbed the binding of MdDOF5.3, reduced MdERF3 expression, relieved the inhibition on MdPGLR3, MdPME2, and MdACO4 expression, and ultimately decreased the flesh firmness and crispness retainability. From a QTL on chromosome 16, a 3-bp deletion in the promoter of MdERF118 decreased its expression by perturbing the binding of MdRAVL1, which increased MdPGLR3 and MdACO4 expression and reduced flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The results implied a sophisticated genetic variation network regulating flesh firmness and crispness retainability. The GAP models can be potentially applied in apple breeding.
pbea | Experimental procedures
ccpt | Plant materials and growth conditions
0fpw | The plant materials were 2,664 bi-parental hybrids derived from 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji' (1185), 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Golden Delicious' (967), and 'Jonathan' x 'Golden Delicious' (512). 'Zisai Pearl' is a Chinese apple cultivar that belongs to Malus asiatica Nakai., while the other three parents are commercial cultivars belonging to M. domestica Borkh. All the hybrids were grown at a density of <LATEX>2 . 5 m \times 0 . 5 m</LATEX> under conventional management and pest con- trol in the Fruit Experimental Station, China Agricultural University (Changping District, Beijing, China).
dqn8 | In 2016-2017, fruit samples were harvested at commercial maturity based on fruit background colour and starch degradation (selected at 7 on a scale of 1-10) (Blanpied and Silsby 1992). After harvest, apples were cold-stored at 1 ℃ with -95% relative humidity in polyethylene bags. Flesh firmness and crispness of three apples per hybrid (all 2,664 hybrids if fruit samples were available) were measured at 0-6th month with one month interval. Apples from hybrids with year-stable extremity phenotypes (randomly five hybrids from each phenotype type) were used for ethylene measurement in 2017. Flesh tissue of 'Zisai Pearl', 'Red Fuji' and hybrids with phenotype type I (12-190, 17-103, and 14-107) and type II (01-067, 11-169, and 17-138) of flesh firmness retainability were used for qRT-PCR analysis for MdERF3 and MdERF118 relative expression. The fruit flesh and leaf samples were collected, imme- diately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ℃ until use.
cop0 | Apple calli induced from the flesh of the cultivar 'Orin' were sub-cultured every three weeks on Murashige and Skoog medium used for <LATEX>A .</LATEX> tumefaciens infection (Jia et al., 2018).
lhkq | Measurements of flesh firmness/crispness and the retainability
82ju | To evaluate the ability of flesh firmness and crispness retention during cold storage, the maximum time (months as unit) till which the apples maintained acceptable flesh firmness (≥7.0 kg/cm2) and crispness (≥0.7 kg/cm2) was recorded as the retainability of

7fqw | flesh firmness and crispness, respectively (Costa et al., 2010; Nybom et al., 2012). Flesh firmness and crispness were measured with a computer-controlled texture analyser TAXT (StableMicroSystem, Godalming, UK) (Costa et al., 2011, 2012). The diameter of the penetrating probe was 0.2 cm, and the penetration depth was 0.5 cm. Punctures were performed on the maximum equator of each apple. Three biological replicates were performed, and each included at least three technical replicates.
rhaz | Measurements of ethylene production
wak1 | To determine ethylene emission, each fruit was weighed and enclosed in a gas-tight container and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (20-25 ℃). One millilitre of gas was sampled from the headspace in the container using a BD syringe (No. 309602, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The ethylene concentration of gas samples was measured with a gas chromatography (HP 5890 series II) (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector. The fruit ethylene production was calculated as described previously (Dougherty et al., 2016).
wtfz | BSA-seq and QTL identification
qy1i | As hybrids with longer flesh firmness and crispness retainability over six months can only be detected in the population of 'Zisai Pearl' x 'Red Fuji', hybrids from this population were used to make BSA bulks. Thirty hybrids were randomly chosen from each phenotype type: type I, type II, and type III for flesh firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. Totally six phenotype extremity bulks were constructed (Figure S3). Genomic DNA from each hybrid was extracted from young leaves and pooled. Each bulked DNA sample was sequenced to obtain 30x genome coverage using a paired- end 150-bp read strategy (Illumina X10, Illumin a, USA). The parental cultivars have been re-sequenced previously (Shen et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020). The re-sequencing data were processed, and QTLs were identified using the BSATOS software package (https://github.com/maypoleflyn/BSATOS) (Shen et al., 2019).
1k9e | RNA-seq
5bjs | RNA-seq was performed to explore DEGs between phenotype types of flesh firmness and crispness retainability during cold storage. Apples of three hybrids (as three biological replicates) from each phenotype type, III, II, and I of flesh firmness or crispness retainability were respectively sampled at 0, 6, 12 and 18 weeks of cold storage. Totally, 72 samples were collected. The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was used to generate 100-bp paired-end reads. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data was performed as previously described (Sun et al., 2016). DEGs were determined by using the false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and the fold change threshold >2.0.
uodj | Candidate gene prediction
k16v | To develop potential diagnostic markers, candidate genes associ- ated with flesh firmness and crispness retainability were predicted by using multi-omics data (Shen et al., 2019). Genes were downloaded from the intervals of the QTLs for flesh firmness or crispness retainability, respectively. SNPs and insertion/deletion variations (InDels) in these genes were called using parental re- sequencing data. Of these genes, those with SNPs or InDels that did not affect the cis-element on the upstream sequence or the functional domain on the coding region were excluded. The genes which expression was not detectable, in addition to the genes with SNPs or InDels only in the promoter but that were not included in the DEGs, were excluded from further analysis.
b2lm | Genomic DNA extraction, RNA extraction and qRT-PCR assay
ti7f | Genomic DNA of young leaves and total RNA of apple flesh or apple calli samples were extracted using the modified CTAB method as previously described (Gasic et al., 2004; Muhammad et al., 1994). cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Japan). The primers were designed according to the sequence on apple genome (GDDH13 v1.1) with premier software (version 5.0) (Premier Biosoft Interpairs, Palo Alto, CA) (Daccord et al., 2017). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The gene encoding apple actin was used as the internal control. Three biological and three technical replicates <LATEX>\left( 3 \times 3 \right)</LATEX> were performed. The primer sequences are listed in Table S16.
oksu | Functional validation of candidate genes
wtow | GUS analysis
o22k | To test whether the allelic variations upstream of MdERF3 and MdERF118 coding sequences (CDS) may affect its promoter activity, 2000-bp promoter fragments were amplified using PCR from the genomic DNA of 'Zisai Pearl' and 'Red Fuji'. After Sanger sequencing, the reporter constructs containing the promoter sequences of MdERF3 and MdERF118 (2000 bp upstream of the start ATG codon, using restriction enzyme sites SalI and EcoRI) were prepared as previously described (Jia et al., 2018). The CDS of MdDof5.3 or MdRAVL1 was introduced into the pRI101 vector using restriction enzyme sites (SalI and BamHI for MdDof5.3; BamHI and XholI for MdRAVL1) to generate the effector constructs. The reporter and effector vectors were constructed and injected into tobacco leaves. After three days infection, the transgenic leaves were dyed using the GUS reporter gene staining kit (Solarbio, China) in three biological replicates and four technical replicates, as described by Zhang et al. (2016). All primer sequences for vector construction are listed in Table S16.
nwfz | Transient overexpression and VIGS
nvfy | A 690 bp MdERF3 and a 1032 bp MdERF118 CDS fragments were cloned from 'Golden Delicious' into the EcoRI/Xholl and EcoRI/KpnI sites of the pTRV2 virus vector as previously described (Li et al., 2017). A. tumefaciens cells harbouring the resultant plasmids were suspended in infiltration buffer supplemented with 150 mm acetosyringone. The inoculum preparations were adjusted to <LATEX>O D _ { 6 0 0 } = 1 . 0 .</LATEX> A mixture of <LATEX>A .</LATEX> tumefaciens cells harbouring pTRV1 and pTRV2 derivatives (1: 1 ratio) was infiltrated into 'Golden Delicious' apple fruit (140 days after anthesis) (Li et al., 2016). The complete MdERF3 and MdERF118 CDS cDNA sequences were amplified and individually cloned into the NdeI/EcoRI and SalI/BamHI sites of the PRI101 vector, followed by infiltration into 'Golden Delicious' apple fruit. The assays were performed with at least six fruit for each vector, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. The primer pairs used are listed in Table S16.

These included MdERF3 pro-F:GUS (Del323),
