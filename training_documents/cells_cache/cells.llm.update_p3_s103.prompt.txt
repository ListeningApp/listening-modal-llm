You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

8mp0 | of the vasculature13,14,16,17 (Fig. 1c). In straight, non-branching regions of human arteries, viscous forces of blood flow predominate over inertial forces, leading to stable, unidirectional laminar flow, which delivers high-magnitude ULS (-15 dyn/cm2) to endothelial cells13,16. Conversely, in curved and branching regions, inertial forces become more promi- nent, leading to disturbed, multidirectional oscillatory flow that deliv- ers low-magnitude OSS (approximately ±4 dyn/cm2) to the endothelial cell surface14,17 (Fig. 1d). The terms 'stable flow' and 'disturbed flow' are typically used in in vivo studies, whereas most in vitro studies use ULS and OSS to describe the experimental flow conditions to which endothelial cells are exposed. To reduce potential confusion and sim- plify these interchangeable terms, we use stable flow or disturbed flow in this Review, whenever feasible.
xjyk | three layers of artery wall are the intima (which contains endothelial cells), the media (with VSMCs) and the adventitia (which contains fibroblasts). c, Common sites of atherosclerosis development, with the associated prevalence of plaques in middle-aged adults reported in the AWHS and PESA studies and the shear stress level average and ranges, based on available literature18,19. d, Time-averaged shear stress levels in the left carotid bifurcation in a healthy individual show that the lateral wall of the internal carotid, a common site of atherosclerosis development, experiences low and oscillating shear stress from disturbed flow. Panel d adapted from ref. 14, Elsevier.
mt0f | The clinical significance of blood flow is that atherosclerosis pref- erentially develops in curved or branching vascular regions exposed to disturbed flow conditions in the presence of additional risk factors such as hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes. For example, athero- sclerotic plaques form preferentially in the lateral wall of the internal carotid artery at the carotid bifurcation, the lesser curvature of the aortic arch, and the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery18,19.
awab | Animal models of flow-induced atherosclerosis
ixcc | Clinical observations strongly suggest a correlation between disturbed flow and sites of atherogenesis, but whether disturbed flow directly causes atherosclerosis remained unknown until it was proven by
8p6h | experimental studies in animal models. Studies using the partial carotid ligation (PCL) and the shear stress-modifying constrictive carotid cuff mouse models directly demonstrated the effect of disturbed flow, or low flow, on atherosclerosis development20,21. In the PCL model, three of the four caudal branches of the left common carotid artery (LCA) are surgically ligated without manipulating the LCA itself. The PCL surgery induces disturbed flow in the LCA with characteristic low-magnitude OSS patterns (Fig. 2a). In Apoe / mice or C57BL/6 mice overexpressing PCSK9 fed a high-fat diet to induce hypercholesterolaemia, the PCL sur- gery causes rapid development of atherosclerosis in the entire length
pmgl | of the LCA within 2-3 weeks 20,22,23 . Importantly, in this mouse model, the contralateral right carotid artery (RCA) continues to be exposed to stable flow and does not develop atherosclerotic plaques, serving as an ideal control in the same animal20,22,23 (Fig. 2a). The constrictive carotid cuff model involves the implantation of a shear stress-modifying cast over a portion of the RCA (Fig. 2b), which exposes that portion of the RCA to three different shear stress regimes that translate into atherosclerosis-inducing patterns in hypercholesterolaemic Apoe-/- mice fed a Western diet: low-magnitude, stable flow in the region proximal to the cast, which induces the development of vulnerable

In hypercholesterolaemic conditions, such as in Apoe / mice fed a Western diet for 8 weeks, the low-magnitude OSS induces atherosclerotic plaque (P) development with a large lipid core (black arrows) in the carotid artery, as shown by haematoxylin and eosin staining.
