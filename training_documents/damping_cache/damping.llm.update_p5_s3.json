Note that the model considered in this paper neglects the additional damping due to transversal spin currents whose form is zero M cross zero zero M. In this case the LLG equation takes the following form:\n41fx | zero M minus M cross zero M equals negative one plus x squared M\n7um8 | times DAM plus delta O, M plus zeta zero M times zero O M.",
