        "content": "nsm3 | The surface expression of hydrothermal precipitates covers approximately seventy-seven thousand square meters, including approximately thirteen thousand eight hundred square meters of active chimneys and mounds, fifty-one thousand eight hundred square meters of inactive chimneys and mounds, and nine thousand three hundred square meters of partially buried chimneys and mounds. Areas of low-temperature venting, dominated by iron and manganese oxides, occur over an additional one hundred thirty thousand square meters (ninety-one thousand square meters of iron oxides and thirty-eight thousand square meters of manganese oxides), although these areas commonly overlap those of the chimneys and mounds. The area of subseafloor sulfide mineralization is not completely known, so the full size of the deposit could be much larger. The areal extent of this deposit is significant compared to others discovered along mid-ocean ridges and along arcs and back-arc basins; fewer than ten percent have dimensions larger than five thousand square meters. Modern sulfide deposits with comparable sizes (by area) include the Solwara one deposit in the Eastern Manus basin (ninety thousand square meters) and the Mir zone, Ashadze-one, and Ashadze-two deposits on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (fifty thousand square meters each). It should be emphasized, however, that the large areal footprint of the Tinakula deposit may not necessarily correlate with a large tonnage of massive sulfide.\njdfw | Methods\nuc9r | Ship-based multibeam bathymetry operating at fifty kilohertz was collected over six hundred eighty-five point six square kilometers in the Starfish-Tinakula area, and the data were gridded with a cell size of fifty meters. Higher-resolution bathymetry was collected over approximately two point two square kilometers that includes the Tinakula deposit, using an ROV-mounted multibeam system at four hundred kilohertz with inertial navigation and gridded with a cell size of zero point two meters. Bottom observations and grab samples were collected during thirteen ROV dives. Shallow seafloor drilling,\nl0ap | including push-coring and rotary diamond drilling, was carried out using the Benthic Geotech portable remotely operated drill. Approximately two hundred seventy meters of drill core was logged and sampled to establish between-hole correlations along the length of the north-south-trending eruptive fissure (sites A-D). Mineralogical and chemical data are reported here on forty-one ROV grab samples and twenty-one drill core samples of chimney and mound material and on sixty-one drill core samples of clay-altered volcaniclastic rocks. Polished thin sections of the sulfide-sulfate chimney samples and epoxy-impregnated clay-altered volcaniclastic samples were prepared by Dettmar Dissection Technology.\nx815 | Whole-rock geochemistry was determined on forty-five bulk samples of sulfide-sulfate material and forty-seven samples of fine less than sixty-three micrometer clay-altered volcaniclastic material at Activation Laboratories. For the sulfide samples, a sodium peroxide fusion was used; major elements (aluminum, calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, silicon, titanium) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry and trace elements\nepbj | (boron, barium, beryllium, bismuth, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, copper, gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, nickel, lead, rubidium, tin, strontium, tantalum, thorium, uranium, vanadium, tungsten, yttrium, zinc, and rare earth elements) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. For the clay-altered samples, a lithium metaborate-tetraborate fusion was used; the major elements (silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, ferric oxide, manganese oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, titanium dioxide, phosphorus pentoxide) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry, and trace elements (barium, beryllium, bismuth, cobalt, cesium, gallium, germanium, hafnium, indium, molybdenum, niobium, rubidium, strontium, tantalum, thorium, thallium, uranium, vanadium, tungsten, yttrium, zirconium, rare earth elements) by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, with additional elements (silver, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc) analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry following a total acid digestion technique. In both sample types, cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine mercury; infrared detection was used to determine total sulfur. Instrumental neutron activation analysis was used to determine gold, silver, arsenic, barium, bromine, chromium, iron, hafnium, iridium, lutetium, sodium, antimony,\nnmn2 | scandium, and zinc in the sulfides and gold, arsenic, bromine, chromium, iridium, scandium, selenium, and antimony in the clay-altered samples. Duplicates and standard reference materials were analyzed after every ten to fifteen samples and indicated a precision of better than ten percent and accuracy of better than five percent for most elements in samples where the analytical values are well above the limit of detection, with values degrading rapidly as the limits of detection are approached.\ng3tm | Sulfide mineral compositions were determined in sixteen sulfide-sulfate samples using a JEOL-JXA eight thousand two hundred electron probe microanalyzer equipped with five wavelength dispersive spectrometers and one energy dispersive detector at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. A fifteen keV accelerating potential and fifty-nanoampere probe (cup) current were used for the analyses. Standards used were chalcopyrite (iron Ka, sulfur Ka, copper Ka), rhodonite (manganese Ka) gallium arsenide\ntfra | (gallium La, arsenic Kb), sphalerite (zinc Ka), silver telluride (silver La), indium antimonide (indium La, antimony La), cadmium sulfide (cadmium La), gold (gold La), cinnabar (mercury Ma), and galena (lead Ma).\n5lm9 | Alteration mineralogy was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis of bulk samples of the altered footwall rocks. Fine less than sixty-three micrometer and coarse greater than sixty-three micrometer fractions were separated by wet sieving, followed by separation into silt (two to sixty-three micrometer) and clay less than two micrometer by settling in cylinders of standing water, following the technique of Moore and Reynolds. The mineralogy of the less than two-micrometer clay fraction from fifty-eight samples was determined using a Philips PW seventeen hundred ten X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a cobalt tube and an automatic divergence slit and monochromator, located at GEOMAR. Operating conditions were forty kilovolts and thirty-five milliampere. Oriented mounts were prepared by wet suspension followed by air drying and were measured with a two-theta scanning angle of three to forty degrees at a scan rate of one second per zero point zero one degree step. Samples were then saturated with ethylene glycol following a standard vaporization technique and reanalyzed. MacDiff version four point two point six software was used for mineral identification and display of the X-ray diffraction data.",
