Duplicate screening was performed to find relevant articles. Corresponding authors were contacted to confirm inclusion and retrieve required clinical data for further analyses to assess the prevalence of reaching endpoints and incidence of subsequent tooth loss, if available, within at least five years of supportive periodontal care. Meta- analyses were carried out to evaluate risk ratios for tooth loss in relation to not reaching the various endpoints.\n68a1 | Results: Fifteen studies including twelve thousand eight hundred eighty-four patients and three hundred twenty-three thousand one hundred eleven teeth were retrieved. Achievement of endpoints at baseline supportive periodontal care was rare (one point three five percent, eleven point zero zero percent and thirty-four point six two percent, respectively, for 'stable periodontitis', 'endpoints of therapy' and 'controlled periodontitis'). Less than a third of the one thousand one hundred ninety subjects with five years of supportive periodontal care data lost teeth-a total of three point one four percent of all teeth were lost. Statistically significant associations with tooth loss, at the subject-level, were found for not achieving 'controlled periodontitis' (relative risk equals two point five seven) , probing pocket depth less than five millimeters (relative risk equals one point five nine) and\nseik | probing pocket depth less than six millimeters (relative risk equals one point nine eight). Conclusions: An overwhelming majority of subjects and teeth do not achieve the proposed endpoints for periodontal stability, yet most periodontal patients preserve most of their teeth during an average of ten to thirteen years in supportive periodontal care.\noq7c | Clinical Relevance\nz4mi | Scientific rationale for study: The risk of tooth loss is determined by clinical periodontal parameters as established in the literature. Composite measures have been established to determine when it is appropriate to end active periodontal therapy.\nhkft | Principal findings: Only a small proportion of subjects reach currently defined endpoints of periodontal therapy, although tooth loss presents as a rare event in treated periodontitis. Practical implications: The findings are novel and can have a significant impact on clinical practice, policy and research. It may be necessary to revisit the clinical endpoints of periodontal therapy to better reflect the risk of tooth loss during supportive periodontal care.\njai3 | One INTRODUCTION |\np57i | Defining periodontal health at the subject- and tooth-level is pivotal in establishing acceptable therapeutic endpoints and to evaluate individualized risk for periodontal disease progression. A successfully treated 'stable periodontitis' subject, as per the World Workshop Classification twenty seventeen, is defined as one with probing pocket depth (PPD) less than or equal to four millimeters, no bleeding on probing (BoP) at four millimeter sites and bleeding on probing in less than ten percent sites. The European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) composed S three treatment guideline-a four-step approach-to treat stages one to three periodontitis. Clinical guidelines for periodontal treatment should consider tangible outcomes-tooth survival and re-treatment. Based on evidence for disease progression, EFP's S three treatment guideline proposed 'endpoints of therapy' for a patient to enter supportive periodontal care (SPC)-no probing pocket depth greater than four millimeters with bleeding on probing and no probing pocket depth greater than or equal to six millimeters. A 'treat-to-target' approach has also been proposed. 'Controlled periodontitis', defined as having less than or equal to four sites with probing pocket depth greater than or equal to five millimeters, incorporates the effects of different periodontal treatments.\nu5ug | Guidance may present us with an ideal scenario where unless the endpoints are met, a subject should not enter into supportive periodontal care. Yet, the evidence is unclear whether this is the reality within clinical practice. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the prevalence of treated periodontitis subjects who have met the following definitions:\ni9k5 | 路 'Stable periodontitis'\n20z2 | 路 'Endpoints of therapy'\n4cgs | 路 'Controlled periodontitis'\nhtre | .\nda3c | probing pocket depth less than five millimeters.\n890q | probing pocket depth less than six millimeters. With tooth loss being the final sequela of periodontitis, the proposed endpoints should be based on whether their unachievement results in increased tooth loss. Therefore, the relationships between the aforementioned endpoints and subsequent tooth loss during a minimum of five years of supportive periodontal care were also assessed, leading to the following focused questions:\njomo | . Focused question one: What is the prevalence of periodontitis in subjects who, at the start of supportive periodontal care, meet the aforementioned endpoints?\n06fi | 路 Focused question two: What is the incidence of periodontitis- related (when reported) or non-specific tooth loss among treated adult periodontitis subjects, using each of the above definitions, who have been in supportive periodontal care for a minimum of five years?\nhb4s | Two MATERIALS AND METHODS |\ncqq2 | Two point one Protocol development and registration |\n1ews | A systematic review protocol was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance. Details of the protocol were registered on PROSPERO on sixteenth February twenty twenty-two. Amendments were made to the original protocol to expand the number of endpoints assessed.\nafyn | Two point two Eligibility criteria |\n8sye | Two point two point one PICOS components\nr04h | Population: Adult human subjects with periodontitis (excluding as a manifestation of systemic or necrotizing disease), who have completed active periodontal therapy (APT). Studies with inclusion/exclusion criteria that would affect the outcome of this systematic review (i.e., prevalence of reaching endpoints) were excluded.\norpr | Intervention: APT encompasses many interventions ranging from behavioral changes to surgical interventions. Studies including a minimum of subgingival non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT) as part of their APT were selected (focused question one).\nk36m | Comparison: Not applicable.\nwnuz | Outcome measures: The primary outcomes were defined as follows:",
