You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

da3c | Given its type of regime, North Korea constituted a challenging target for Humint. This task had become even more difficult because of the cumbersome organization of the various bodies involved in this mission. Following the withdrawal of US forces in June 1949, American military assistance to the South Korean army was provided by the Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG), which also passed information from ROK sources to the Pentagon. In addition, the United States maintained three small intelligence missions in Korea: the Korean Liaison Office (KLO), established by MacArthur's G-2, Gen. Charles Willoughby after the
890q | American forces left South Korea in 1949 and tasked with intelligence collection and analysis;20 the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI); and a CIA element that was linked to the local police and intelligence services. Their main sources were the South Korean collection agencies." Although South Korean officers claim that the intelligence that they collected about the coming attack was valuable,22 there is a consensus that G-2 in Tokyo regarded it as conflicting and useless.23
jomo | The KLO and CIA collection abilities in North Korea are a matter of controversy. According to Willoughby, in 1949, he had sixteen agents in North Korea. However, KLO officers had reservations about "their competence, motivation, and loyalty."24 Similarly, according to John Singlaub, he and his colleagues recruited dozens of Koreans in Manchuria between 1946 and 1948, trained them as agents, and sent them across the Yalu River into North Korea. The agents provided valuable information to the CIA station in Seoul,
06fi | p. 130 and on the eve of the war reported on specific North 4 Korean preparations for invasion. Based on these reports, the CIA distributed a document assessing "that a North Korean invasion was pending" on June 19.25 Other intelligence histories of the war tend to ignore the CIA's Humint contribution. Thus, a semi-official report of American Humint in the war maintains that when it started "Korea was an intelligence vacuum."26 Academic accounts and the CIA documents themselves refute the claim that the agency forecast a North Korean invasion as an immediate threat a week before the war (see below).
hb4s | Lastly, the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), which was established in 1941 and transferred to the CIA in 1947, provided some information as well. However, its focus was less on North Korea per se, and more on Soviet media coverage of the two Koreas and Soviet-North Korean relations. Consequently, Osint missed some hints in the North Korean media (primarily deceptive messages) that could have indicated a certain change in the situation prior to the invasion." 27
cqq2 | ii. The information and its estimate
1ews | Given the low ranking of North Korea in the US intelligence requirements order of priorities, the Comint contribution to an early warning was minimal. Post factum, it provided two hints of the coming invasion: an increase in Soviet targeting of South Korean communications between April 21 and May 15; and, from February 1950 onward, indications of large Soviet shipments of bandages and medicines to North Korea and Manchuria.28 FBIS monitoring of Soviet references to North Korea and North Korean broadcasts revealed no significant indications for a drastic change in the public attitude of both states on the issue of "armed unification."
afyn | Humint provided a somewhat better picture. On January 13, 1950, a CIA document reported further expansion of the KPA forces, including tank units and heavy artillery, in the border zone with South Korea. In addition, the report notified an influx of PLA forces in Manchuria." A G-2 report 4 that was distributed six days before the invasion included significant war indicators: "an imminent enemy offensive-extensive troop movements along the 38th parallel; evacuation of all civilians north of the parallel for two kilometers; suspension of civilian freight service from Wonsan to Ch'orwon and the transportation of military supplies only; concentration of armored units in the border area; and the arrival of large shipments of weapons and ammunition." On the same day, a CIA report included no specific warning indicators. It did notice, however, that the KPA continued to deploy forces near the border, that the deployment included tanks and heavy artillery that had moved there "in recent months," and that, in general, the North Korean military forces in the border area "equal or surpass the strength of southern Korean army units similarly deployed."31
8sye | Some Humint sources also referred to specific dates of the coming offensive. On December 30, 1949, Willoughby sent Washington reports from field agents that warned of a North Korean invasion in March or April of 1950. A month-and-a-half later, he delivered two additional warnings about an attack in March or June. KLO officers reported on March 10 that the invasion had been rescheduled from March or April to June
r04h | 1950. However, since most of the warnings came from South Korean field sources, rather than American sources, they were dismissed by American intelligence officers.
orpr | The CIA was right in assessing that the withdrawal of the American army from Korea would lead to a communist "armed unification," but it erred in estimating the circumstances under which the invasion would take place. It also was wrong in evaluating the balance of forces between North Korea and the ROK. In early January 1947, the CIA's predecessor, the Central Intelligence Group, had assessed that the USSR's long-term goal was to take over the whole of the Korean Peninsula, and that since the US military presence was the main obstacle to employing this scheme, "Soviet propaganda and Communist agitation have consistently sought to drive the US out of Korea."33 Toward the end of 1947, a CIA assessment warned that "U.S. withdrawal would have the effect of leaving South Korea incapable of offering any serious resistance to p. 132 eventual domination by the 4 North." A March 1948 document estimated that the right-wing South Korean regime under Syngman Rhee "would be incapable of withstanding ideological and military pressures from North Korea." Following the elections in August, the CIA assessment was somewhat more optimistic, expressing the belief that a strong South Korean army could be built before the expected American military withdrawal, and that such an army could serve as an effective deterrent against communist aggression. 36
k36m | The belief, shared by all American estimators, that the unification of the Korean Peninsula would be initiated by the USSR, and not by Kim Il Sung, was expressed in a February 1949 report of a decrease in Communist influence in South Korea. Consequently, the CIA analysts concluded that the conditions were not ripe for "carrying out the Soviet plan for the eventual absorption of South Korea into the Democratic Peoples Republic." This estimate relied on the expectation that "the Politburo would not engage in overt forms of aggression which involved the risk of a general war for the present and several years hence." A more alarmed tone was expressed a week later, noting that the scheduled American military withdrawal in June "would probably in time be followed by an invasion, timed to coincide with Communist-led South Korean revolts, by the North Korean People's Army possibly assisted by small battle-trained units from Communist Manchuria."39 This estimate is considered by some as evidence that the CIA correctly foresaw the coming events.40
wnuz | The South Korean estimate was more pessimistic and also more accurate. Based on the "recent enemy situation and general developments," 4 the ROK Army Headquarters warned in its annual intelligence estimate of December 27, 1949, that "the enemy would carry out a full-scale offensive campaign in the spring of 1950." By March, the warning had become more concrete, forecasting June as the time of the invasion. The KLO and the KMAG G-2 reported this information, but it did not have a considerable impact in Tokyo or in Washington because it had gone through Willoughby, who rejected the Korean predictions. 42
