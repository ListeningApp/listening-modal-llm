You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

xrnt | Summarizing Flow Chart showing the various ways that ecologically similar species may segregate or differentiate the overlap of their foraging niches (Birds)
c8ra | Summary: Differential Niche Overlap & Complementarity
p1l0 | 1. Differential Niche Overlap comprises 3 major dimensions:
1i8b | · Spatial: Horizontal (habitat types) & vertical (altitude, vegetation strata)
5sfj | · Temporal: Time of day/night, seasonal variation (dry/wet, summer/winter)
vk4h | · Trophic: Generalist or Specialist dietary trait, foraging techniques/ strategies
nsm3 | 2. Niche Differentiation, Complementarity and Coexistence often interrelated:
jdfw | · Niche dimensionality 1-> Niche differentiation 1-> Complementarity 1
uc9r | · High niche differentiation predisposes Complementarity -> Coexistence
l0ap | · High overlap in some niche dimensions tolerated by otherwise low overlaps
x815 | Summary: Differential Niche Overlap & Complementarity
epbj | 3. Community wide niche partitioning limits similarity and increase coexistence:
nmn2 | · High overlap in vertical and horizontal space -> low trophic overlap
g3tm | · High dietary overlap -> low, abutting, disjunct and spatial niches
tfra | · High dietary and spatial overlap -> low overlap in temporal niche
5lm9 | 4. Coexistence facilitated by limiting similarity and hence niche overlap:
wp2c | · Spatial separation: vertical-horizontal habitat ranges, territoriality
us5v | · Resource partitioning: Diet and foraging techniques diverging
rs2m | · Morphological divergence: Body size, feeding apparatus (teeth, claws, beaks)
uz9y | ABCS 349: Objectives of Lecture 6 - Niche Partitioning & Species Richness
8ov0 | 1. An Introduction to modelling of species richness using niche partitioning:
mj9m | · What pertinent factors within the niche concept theory predicts diversity?
94h3 | . How are these factors interrelated and what are the dynamics among them?
9jx1 | 2. An Overview of various models to explain species numbers in space and time:
c3lz | · Are they mathematical stochastic or deterministic models?
8bwk | · Graphically explained models to support the notational equations?
ez9s | . How does the models explain the links between niche dimensionality and how many species than can be 'packed' into a natural system or community?
mqot | 3. A Comparison of various models to explain species numbers on islands:
oc99 | · The species-area models explained - islands and mainland islands
gipz | · The island biogeography model: immigration-emigration-speciation-extinction
b4wj | 4. An Account of the theories behind speciation and extinction processes:
5xlt | · What drives speciation in relation to niche overlap and competition?
9bz4 | · What drives extinction in relation to niche overlap and competition?
yfv2 | Ds = p (1 + Cã), where Du
pujl | · Based on MacArthur's model, communities diversity is shaped in 3 potentially interacting ways:
3rqe | 1. Resource base: How big is n in the niche hypervolume. Areas with more available resource have larger Dr and C components (= niche space) and can therefore contain more species (b).
nsi3 | 2. Niche width or degree of specialization of component species (Du) Narrow niches can be packed tighter and thus contain more species (c)
nil3 | 3. Niche overlap between species (a). Greater species overlap (i.e. smaller exclusive niches) leads to greater diversity even if two communities are similar in both (a) and (b) areas (d)
68a1 | 4. Niche curve shape also counts, i.e. in thick-tailed (leptokurtic) curves (e) more species can be packed on the same resource gradient than thin-tailed (platykurtic) curves (e) 73
seik | Niche Partitioning & Species Richness (2)
oq7c | Forest Succession and Increased Bird Diversity (Species Richness):
z4mi | · As habitat heterogeneity increases and more bird species are added, these have to separate on an increasing number of niche dimensions, particularly:
hkft | > Food type, Foraging techniques, Foraging height, Micro-habitat type
jai3 | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (1)
p57i | · When increasing the area (A) from which one samples various species populations, the total species number (S) increase in a positive way according to the following logarithmic deterministic model: S = C.AZ (Areas = Oceanic islands or Habitat islands on mainlands)
u5ug | . Factors that specifically contribute to the S-Area relationship are:
i9k5 | 1. Large islands are also subject to larger sampling sizes of individuals (N) from species populations thereby increasing the probability of encountering new species; hence a mere sampling phenomenon or artefact of more effective species sampling as N increases
20z2 | 2. As the island size increases, the probability of encountering different habitat types also increases: High landscape heterogeneity: Lakes, mountains, valleys, swamps, oases etc., and such features contain more potential niches that can be filled by species
4cgs | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (2)
htre | 3. Large islands inevitably also contain large populations, and large populations are less vulnerable to local extinction phenomena (e.g. predation, parasites, pathogens)
da3c | 4. Large island populations also have higher speciation potentials due to higher population variability contained herein (high polymorphism and resource use diversity
890q | 5. Large islands inevitably represent larger targets for colonizing species (immigration) as the probability of encountering the area increases with size
jomo | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (3)
06fi | · The normal range of Z is 0.20 - 0.40 for true (oceanic) islands and often around 0.25.
hb4s | · Z is only 0.1 - 0.25 for recently isolated habitat islands (e.g. forest surrounded by farms, a lake, a gap in the forest, or an oasis).
cqq2 | · Z > 0.26 for long-term isolated habitats on the mainland or very large islands such as Australia.
1ews | · As habitat connectivity increases, the S-Area relationship is reduced => Low z-value
afyn | · Habitat connectivity is related to habitat diversity and as oceanic islands are more isolated than mainland habitat islands, they display stronger S-Area relationship (high z-value)
8sye | Biogeography - The Species-Area Model (4)
r04h | · Logging both sides of the S-Area power function:
orpr | log S = log C + z log A
k36m | · C and Z are constants depending on both habitat type, animal community and is specific to variability in dispersability and mobility of the species herein.
wnuz | . In a x-y logarithmic plot, log C is the intercept on the y-axis, and z denotes the graph slope.
sy14 | . The z-value denotes how strong the S and A relationship is (= positive correlation).
ghss | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (1)
3s61 | · Modelling species number (S) on true islands: S depends on two independent variables: 1. Immigration rate (I) 2. Extinction rate (E)
s3rm | · S is determined when an equilibrium between I and E rates is obtained
pqxb | · As S 1, I rate is lowered (1) as potential niche space is occupied (saturation 1)
08qc | . In contrast when S î then E rate 1 due to increased interspecific competition
hdj2 | . Small islands have high E and low I rates: They are small targets and have small vulnerable populations; the opposite is the case for large islands; high I and low E
a57g | Immigration rate (I)
g8m3 | · Distance to mainland also a factor for I rate: Distance islands have low I and close islands have higher I.
a9av | . Thus, S is highest on large islands nearby mainland (D), and smallest on small islands far from the mainland (A)
73l3 | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (2)
ornm | . Extinction Rate: Depends on 1) Island Size, 2) Distance to mainland (isolation degree)
u2z1 | · Island Size: Large islands have larger populations, hence genetic population variability is high and populations therefore more resilient towards predators, diseases, and stochastic detrimental events: e.g. storms, tsunamis, floods, drought etc.)
atmh | · Distance to mainland: If close to mainland, extinctions may be delayed by regular immigration, thus compensating for the species loss over time
7hgg | MacArthur-Wilson's Equilibrium Theory (3)
xwsv | · Immigration Rate: Depends on 1) Island Size, 2) Distance to mainland
756b | · Island Size: A large island represents a greater target for colonisers => higher probability of colonization.
6bx7 | · Distance to mainland: If the distance is short, the likeliness of species colonizing from the mainland is higher than for more remote islands, to which many species may have difficulties in reaching successfully (depends on mobility and dispersability of animals).
spl6 | · In effect species number is highest on large islands close to the mainland (CL) and smallest on small islands far away (remote/ isolated) from the mainland (DS)
7wzm | Modelling Species Number on Habitat Islands
e9xj | . On habitat islands, species numbers depend on: 1) Speciation rate and 2) Extinction rate
9vl6 | · Immigration plays a minor role on the large scale and is replaced by speciation processes.
c2fd | . However, if habitat connectivity is high between islands, immigration from species rich areas is important in ecological time frame; speciation only evolutionary time frame
jzvp | Speciation Rate
f71y | · Fewer empty niches reduce the chances of adaptive radiation by virtue of reducing character displacement processes
31e1 | Extinction Rate
40ry | As species saturation increases interspecific competition • increases extinction rate through the competitive exclusion principle (similarly to true islands)
d1j2 | Summary - Niche Partitioning & Species Richness (1)
wstc | 1. Species richness and the niche concept are interrelated and determined by:
ba1e | . Niche dimensionality and differentiation: Related to habitat heterogeneity
en95 | . Niche width and shape: Narrow and leptokurtic niches increase diversity
