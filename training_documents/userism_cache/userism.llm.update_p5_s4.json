What kinds of entities, and relationships among them, are represented to user(s), and in what ways? The interface is still a part of the technical system, however, as argued further below, we should distinguish between the internal representations maintained by a computational system and the presentation of those representations to user(s).\na0by | The Design Process Level. These representations allow designers to account for user(s) or others during the design process. Who and what is represented during the design process, and in what ways? Design process representations may involve crafting personas, writing scenarios, accounting for stakeholders, etc. These may or may not translate into explicit representations at the interface or systems levels. However, the design process is often where experiences are typified, influencing system and interface representations through design requirements.\nu1ky | The Ideological Level. These representations function at the level of discourse within a discipline or field of study. How do we account for the various entities and relationships involved in interactions between humans and computers? Ideological representations are most common in work that discusses users-their needs, qualities, and experiences. Ideological representations are subtle: they occur when we use the term \"user\" to aggregate representations from the three previous levels, collapsing systems, interface, design, and lived experience. Reflexive scholarship in HCI sometimes explicitly focuses on these representations, such as the pivotal pieces across the three waves of HCI. These representations sometimes become most visible in how we narrate the work we do, both to ourselves and to others outside the field. The most common ideological representation in HCI can be seen when we equate \"person\" with \"user.\"\nhtm9 | Across these levels, the \"post\" of post-userism highlights the goal of representing, accounting for, and designing for subject positions other than that of the classical user. In this way, we eschew a fully post-structuralist approach, which\n8hul | would dissolve or transcend categorical boundaries entirely. We also eschew a fully post-humanist approach, which would place something other than a human being (a relationship, a non-human entity, an organization, an event, etc.) at the center of design. Essentially, such approaches would identify and attempt to transcend the limits of subjectivity as a design construct. While interesting and important possibilities, this paper focuses instead on the representation of subject positions across the four levels described above.\n87vz | At the ideological level, HCI has a fairly well-developed body of work accounting for post-user subject positions. However, those developments have not been manifest to the same degree at other levels. This paper addresses how we might go about incorporating post-userism into the design process, interface, and systems representations.\nym66 | SCENARIOS AND STRATEGIES: POST-USERISM IN PRACTICE\nl0a3 | At this point, we can return to the definitional question: What is post-userism? How might you know when you have a situation that could benefit from a post-user lens? Post-userism involves attending to representations of the ecologies of subject positions that people might occupy with respect to technology. Researchers, designers, systems architects, etc. could benefit from post-userism when they encounter breakdowns across the four levels of representation described above. As a practical strategy, post-userism does not necessarily help solve existing problems. Rather, it enables more comprehensive problem setting or problem framing, facilitating a design scope that encompasses greater varieties of human-computer interactions.\nu8nw | Here we describe instances of post-userism and what post-userism looks like in practice. To do so, this section works through a series of scenarios where we see post-userism, outlining strategies for applying a post-user lens in each. The strategies synthesize across examples, demonstrating the process of identifying how the user gets variously deployed across different levels of representation. These strategies both help define the ecology of subject positions one might want to consider and provide some guidance as to what you might do about it. As described further below, we hope this series of strategies provides a foundation upon which future work can build.\nl2v9 | As such, this section presents a non-exhaustive typology. We neither attempt, nor are we able, to articulate and provide strategies for every situation in which the ideology of the user breakdown across levels of representation. Furthermore, not all such breakdowns can be, or should be, resolved. Instead, we offer a series of qualities that characterize subject positions in human-computer relationships beyond \"use.\" For each quality, we also offer a conceptual strategy that can be used to grapple with such situations. As HCI researchers and practitioners do so, they\nafbe | Interactive Design Methodologies\n78r8 | can contribute insights they have gained toward a broader understanding of designing for an ecology of subject positions. To reiterate, an ecology in this context includes a depiction of each subject position, an enumeration of the relationships among them, and a description each's relationship to the technology interaction.\n320g | Each of the following subsections offers a quality that certain subject positions might have, along with a strategy to account for such subject positions in design. For instance, when your ecology of subject positions involves indirection, you might consider designing for delegates.\ntp8g | Indirection\ngxfd | Indirection involves cases where the person using the system does so on behalf of another. A prime example can be seen in intermediated interactions. Based on ethnographic work in two urban slums in Bangalore, Sambasivan et al. describe cases in which surrogates act on behalf of users who, for reasons including illiteracy and limited technological abilities, cannot engage in the interaction themselves. In these cases, users interact with the system indirectly through an intermediary. As another example, some rural communities have a single household with a telephone or computer. Similar situations sometimes arise in Old Order Amish communities to constrain the influence that such technologies have on the community. In these cases, the householder who has telephone or Internet access acts as a relay for others. In organizational contexts, one employee, often an assistant, may schedule meetings or respond to email on behalf of another, often a supervisor. This work of surrogates and collaborative use can also be seen in care workers for the elderly or cognitively impaired. One could also consider the navigation of airplanes or naval ships, often used as object lessons for distributed cognition. A commanding officer navigates indirectly, collecting information and issuing commands through the individuals observing and operating the vessel's various instruments (compass, speedometer, steering, etc.).\ns2v1 | In each of these cases, the concept of the user breaks down across levels of representation. Consider Sambasivan et al.'s intermediated interaction and email systems: At the systems level, there is a single person who is authenticated and accessing their email data. At the interface level, the person who is sending and receiving those emails interacts via the intermediary, not with the technology itself. At the design level, the concepts of authentication and access codify the one-to-one correspondence between human user and user account, omitting the possibility of other configurations. At the ideological level, we might be interested in accounting both for the intermediary user and for the person on whose behalf the intermediary is functioning. However, those two subject positions are absent at other representational levels (systems, interface, design process). Similar disconnects\njkp9 | across levels of representation occur in the other cases mentioned above.\nz8tt | Delegates",
