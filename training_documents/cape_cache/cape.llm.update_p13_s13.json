        "content": "5lm9 | The Special Committee consulted some key stakeholders in the University, including some members of Convocation and also relied on documents received from colleagues. Some of the stakeholders consulted included the Provost of the College of Health and Allied Sciences as well as the Dean, Vice-Dean and Faculty Officer of the School of Medical Sciences.\nwp2c | Documents consulted by the Committee included the University of Cape Coast Statutes (the current Statutes and its predecessors, that is two thousand twelve, two thousand three); Report of the Professor Yankson's Committee on Grievances of UTAG UCC and other documents.\nus5v | ISSUES RAISED DURING THE INTERACTIONS\nrs2m | It was admitted that some individuals and Departments are the cause of delay in processing of promotion documents. The Faculty Members of the School of Medical Sciences, however, raised the following concerns regarding delays in processing of their promotion documents:\nuz9y | One. The time it takes to receive updates on assessment outcomes is too long; in some instances it has taken three to five years.\n8ov0 | Two. There are ambiguities in communication to applicants regarding assessment results. An example of such communication is; \"Two reports received to submit two new assessors\", even when the names of assessors have been re-submitted countless times.\nmj9m | Three. There are unexplained delays and lack of clarity on some decisions taken on the promotion of some colleagues at the Appointments and Promotions Board.\n94h3 | Four. The requirement for acquisition of terminal degrees before some colleagues are considered for promotion to a higher rank is unfair and a demotivation to Clinicians in the School, particularly those with Fellowship qualifications who have contributed immensely to the University's achievements.\n9jx1 | Five. The terms of A and P's implementation of assessment outcomes are not clear or fair and mostly communication regarding such outcomes unnecessarily delays.\nc3lz | The Provost of the College of Health and Allied Sciences identified the following factors that cause the delay:\n8bwk | a) lack of cooperation from individuals when changes are suggested to be effected;\nez9s | b) unavailability of some individuals to make correction to the promotion documents;\nmqot | c) some key administrators delay the processing of documents especially when they have to go on leave;\noc99 | d) difficulty in getting a response from possible assessors (abroad), especially in the case of promotion to professorial status, and at worse, from Ghana with regard to some disciplines;\ngipz | e) difficulty in understanding reports and requests from the Directorate of Human Resource due to brevity and inadequate clarity.\nb4wj | On the requirement that Clinicians should obtain Doctor of Philosophy degrees to warrant promotion to higher ranks, the Provost responded that it should not be a problem considering that Fellowship qualifications are deemed in many jurisdictions, even within the country, as parallel to a PhD.\n5xlt | FINDINGS AND ISSUES FOR REDRESS\n9bz4 | A. Breach of the Criteria for Appointments and Promotions of Senior Members\nyfv2 | One. Withholding the Promotion of Mr. Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham\npujl | a) Mr. Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham was appointed a Lecturer in the Department of Classics and Philosophy on first November twenty fifteen. With the requisite papers, he applied for promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer and was promoted on the first August, twenty twenty.\n3rqe | b) On fourteenth April twenty twenty-two, he received a letter from the Vice-Chancellor withholding his promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer effective first August twenty twenty.\nnsi3 | c) The basis for withholding his promotion, as given in the Vice-Chancellor's letter, was the report of the Special Council Committee on the interpretation of a recommendation of the twenty sixteen Ad hoc Committee on Grievances of UTAG UCC.\nnil3 | Convocation, therefore, requests answers to the following questions:\n68a1 | a) Will his promotion be backdated to the point it was withheld when issues are resolved?\nseik | b) Was Mr. Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham informed of the decision of the Ad hoc Committee? If not, is it fair that he suffers at this time when he did not know the decision?\noq7c | c) How many appointment and promotion criteria does the University of Cape Coast have?\nz4mi | d) Is an ad hoc committee report a promotion criteria or a substantive legislative instrument?\nhkft | e) How many Senior Members has this been applied to?\njai3 | In our view, Mr. Kow-Kwegya Amissah Abraham has been wrongfully dealt with considering that there are similar cases and examples.\np57i | Two. The Case of Appointment of Professor Emmanuel K. Abu\nu5ug | a) Professor Emmanuel K. Abu was appointed as a Tutor on twenty-fourth November, twenty ten. Prior to that, he had been a Senior Research Assistant at the then Department of Optometry from first September, two thousand nine.\ni9k5 | b) At the time of the appointment, he possessed a Doctor of Optometry degree. He later obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in twenty sixteen.\n20z2 | c) He was appointed as Tutor on twenty-fourth November, twenty ten. While paragraphs one to three of his appointment letter were about Tutorship, the fourth paragraph\n4cgs | ----\nhtre | i) The promotion from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer was expected to be in accordance with paragraph six point seven point one, Schedule D of the two thousand twelve Statutes which, inter alia, provides that candidate seeking promotion to the rank of Senior Lecturer must have engaged in university teaching, research and community as a Lecturer for at least four years. Considering that Professor Abu did not qualify and was not properly appointed as a Lecturer, the criterion was disregarded.\nda3c | The findings from the foregoing are as follows:\n890q | i. Professor Emmanuel K. Abu did not possess a Master of Philosophy degree and two years teaching experience to be appointed as Lecturer in twenty ten.\njomo | ii. The decision to convert Tutors to Assistant Lecturers clearly indicated that Tutors and Lecturers were not equivalent.\n06fi | iii. The salary enjoyed by Professor Abu as a Lecturer had no basis and should not have been used to equate his position as Tutor to Lecturer. Indeed, if the two ranks were the same, he would have been appointed directly to the rank of Lecturer.\nhb4s | iv. The placement of Professor Abu on the Lecturer's scale when he did not qualify to be there could have been done deliberately in our view; if it was in error, there were plenty of opportunities to correct this but it was not corrected.\ncqq2 | Three. The Case of Professor Samuel Kyei\n1ews | a) Professor Samuel Kyei was appointed as Tutor on eighteenth October, twenty eleven.\nafyn | b) Apparently Professor Kyei had enrolled in a Masters Programme (Master of Philosophy Pharmacology) at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. His CV indicates that he completed the Master of Philosophy Pharmacology programme in twenty twelve.\n8sye | c) The Academic Board, at its First Regular Meeting (twenty fifteen/twenty sixteen) held on twenty-seventh October, twenty fifteen approved the recommendation from the Appointments and Promotions Board to upgrade the Tutors in the Department of Optometry who possessed Master of Philosophy degrees to the rank of Assistant Lecturer.\nr04h | d) Doctor Samuel Kyei's designation was upgraded to the rank of Assistant Lecturer in accordance with the decision of the Academic Board with effect from twenty-sixth February twenty sixteen.\norpr | e) Professor Kyei obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in Optometry degree dated fourteenth April, twenty sixteen from the University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.\nk36m | f) He was thereafter upgraded to the rank of Lecturer with effect from first April, twenty sixteen.\nwnuz | g) Professor Kyei was promoted to the rank of Senior Lecturer with effect from first February twenty eighteen, exactly two years after his elevation to the rank of Lecturer.\nsy14 | h) Professor Kyei was again promoted to the rank of Associate Professor effective first February, twenty twenty-one through the accelerated mode according to documents available to Convocation.\nghss | The findings from Professor Kyei's case are as follows:",
