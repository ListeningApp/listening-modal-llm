        "content": "w8jo | . You share many forms of structural commitment with your partner, but don't have emotional or sexual intimacy (and one or both of you is not okay with that).\nn4g6 | . When you ask your spouse or partner for more of their time or affection they get defensive and point out all of the professional, financial or domestic things that they do to show their commitment.\nxrzh | . You often feel alone in your relationship even though you live together or are around each other a lot.\nb5m5 | . You or your partner defer to gender stereotypes to make the absence of certain forms of emotional or sexual connection more tolerable, such as \"that's just how men are\" or \"well you know how women can be.\"\nwu5k | . In your relationship, the ideal of the marriage or the greater purpose of the family have become more important than the direct experience of how you treat each other.\nn462 | . You're married or in primary partnership, but feel like you're always getting the short end of the stick when it comes to your spouse or partner's time, affection and attention.\n7tg4 | . You know your partner is committed to you, but you don't know if they actually like and enjoy being with you.\n5kya | If you experience any of these things I suggest working with your partner or partners to strengthen the emotional experience of your secure attachment, which is covered in Part Three. As I address in the next chapter, I've seen the dangers of people depending on the structure of their relationship to feel safe together. When they change that structure, either through opening up from monogamy or transitioning to a less hierarchical form of consensual non-monogamy, it can expose relational insecurities that were disguised by the pseudo or contrived security acquired from the previous relationship structure. The takeaway message here is not to abolish all relationship\n7muy | hierarchies or shared bank accounts, but instead for people to procure secure attachment from their relational experiences instead of their relationship structures. Allow your direct experience with a partner to be the vehicle to secure attachment instead of having certain relationship concepts, narratives or structures be the vehicle. When our experience with a partner is the route to secure attachment, we might still want certain relationship structures, benchmarks and milestone experiences, but the urgency at which we define, solidify or need to nail things down can relax and occur more organically.\n3zl7 | Current research and resources about attachment and consensual non-monogamy are scarce and at an embryonic stage. I am hopeful that more research and resources will continue to crop up as awareness and acceptance of non-monogamy continues to grow, but for many people it will not be soon enough. Part Three is designed to walk you through the different components of secure functioning, not based on your relationship structure, but based on the behaviors that you can apply to any of your consensual non-monogamous relationships in which you seek to deepen polysecurity.\ni0sj | Chapter Six The Importance of Attachment in Consensual Non-Monogamy\nslsh | To start, let me say that secure attachment with multiple romantic partners is possible. Honestly, it's really a necessity to do consensual non-monogamy well and thrive, but we'll get to that. Just as children do not only bond with one attachment figure, adults do and can have multiple securely attached relationships. When secure functioning is at play within consensual non-monogamous relationships, partners communicate well, trust each other, stick to their agreements and discuss wanted changes. They tend to have more compassion for their partners, they act respectfully towards their metamours and while they still do experience jealousy or envy, they are also able to support each other in the process. Jealousy becomes an opportunity for increased clarity and connection and it doesn't take them or their relationships down. When I talk to consensual non-monogamous folks who are securely attached, they may admit that their relationships require work and acknowledge that they are not always easy (more people means more complexity, and scheduling is always going to be an issue), but they also describe an underlying sense of ease within and throughout their relationships. When people are securely attached, they enjoy each other and the process of living as consensually non-monogamous.\nji5o | My experience with consensual non-monogamous clients has taught me an enormous amount about how and why understanding consensual non-monogamy through an attachment lens is so important. As consensual non-monogamous individuals and couples began to seek my counsel, I began to notice two distinct camps: those who were mostly thriving and those who seemed to be barely surviving. For those who were thriving, our work was often short-term. As these people entered into a new relationship paradigm, they reached out to me for some support, guidance and perspective. They usually quickly expressed that they had got what they came for. Now better able to implement their consensual non-monogamous journey, they moved merrily along their way. Every few months, I'd even receive a text or email with photos of their entire smiling polycule around a kitchen table (I kid you not).\n4nlx | These people still reached out for therapy or coaching sessions once in a while due to breakups, STI scares, uncharted consensual non-monogamous situations to figure out and relationship transitions to process, but overall, consensual non-monogamy was working for them. They expressed feeling secure, and from my perspective they were enacting their multiple romantic partnerships, as well as their metamour relationships, from a place of secure functioning.\no3xz | I call these people who thrive with their multiple partners polysecure. This is the state of being both securely attached to multiple romantic partners and having enough internal security to be able to navigate the structural relationship insecurity inherent to non-monogamy, as well as the increased complexity and uncertainty that occurs when having multiple partners and metamours. More succinctly, being polysecure is having secure attachment with yourself and your multiple partners. Polysecure people are functioning securely both interpersonally and intrapersonally, both of which will be examined in more detail in Part Three.\n84mq | There may be some people who enter non-monogamy and are able to be polysecure right off the bat, but for many people this is not the case. All of my clients want to be secure within their selves and with their partners, but often the reality of non-monogamy is too complicated, painful, dramatic, confusing and even traumatizing. These people transition to non-monogamy and feel more polyinsecure than polysecure. For some of the individuals and couples I've worked with, their consensual non-monogamous struggles mirror the relationship challenges they encountered when previously monogamous, but many people are surprised, even shocked, by the issues they face because they are so unlike their monogamous past. Among couples who transition from monogamy to polyamory, many had healthy, secure monogamous relationships together and can't make sense of why they are now having so many communication problems, misunderstandings or fights despite their best efforts to be clear and loving with each other. Some of these couples feel as if they are falling apart at the seams. For many, the transition to poly (whether solo or with a partner) brings up forms of insecurity, anxiety and even panic attacks that they may not have experienced before. It is not uncommon for me to hear people say that they\n56tt | theoretically want to be poly, but emotionally they don't know if they can do it because they feel like they are losing their mind.\nchel | People struggling with a transition from monogamy to consensual non-monogamy may also find themselves without practical support from their friends, family and community. Sometimes, the people closest to them, even therapists, advise these struggling couples or individuals to go back to being monogamous. I have heard such couples receive advice that sounds something like, \"Well, if you're struggling more in your relationship or with yourself now that you're polyamorous, you should just go back to being monogamous and everything will be okay again.\"",
