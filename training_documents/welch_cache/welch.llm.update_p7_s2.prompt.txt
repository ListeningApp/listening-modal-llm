You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

xb13 | D.R .: The truth of it is, we were trying to tie that all in. We were already planning a nod to the tornado and the chaos. The working title of the project was "Empty Trainload of Sky." But as we got closer to finishing the sequence, it crossed my mind that, since the tornado, I've been in that building fourteen to sixteen hours a day, every day, for five years. And so if anything had shaped the emotional content
cxqi | G.W .: It was Woodland. So much energy and effort and tears and sweat-and certainly a little blood-went into bringing it back again. We were so happy to not have it destroyed.
qfmx | D.R .: Let's discuss even the wisdom of bringing it back.
rut3 | G.W .: It's gonna happen again!
m3cp | D.R .: It's not like anything has changed with the environment. Severe weather events are more common. We're doing this thing, and I'm thinking, What do we get? Maybe twelve months? Do we get two years?
mq4s | But there's something so beautiful about that, too. It's like falling in love-you know it could end in absolute disaster, in boundless heartache, but what choice do you have? You do it anyway.
95el | G.W .: [Laughs.] It's gonna end in darkness and a collapsing ceiling.
a0a5 | The theme of disaster has been on my mind lately: all these horrifying, existentially unsettling things that once seemed off the table, things that were so unlikely or impossible, things that only conspiracy theorists worried about, man, they all feel so possible now. I suppose Woodland, as a place, can be seen as a kind of nexus of that?
gocl | G.w .: You're right on. So much of what went into this record was things happening that you couldn't imagine happening, losing things that you could not imagine losing. Unimaginable destruction.
ob1z | D.R .: We had enough songs that we were kind of aiming toward a double record. Then I changed my mind and thought, Maybe we'll do something akin to what Bright Eyes did in 2005-put out two records that are slightly different in theme at the same time. But as I was sequencing what ended up being "Woodland," I saw these themes of-"Bells and the Birds," is it a song, or is it a warning? It's about trying to interpret what is happening around you, and decide is it good, or is it bad?
m4cb | G.W .: Is it happy, or sad? What is it? This theme of "What is it?" is in "Empty Trainload of Sky." What is it? It came from this vision of a train that didn't seem to have any substance. It was passing across the sky and there was a real moment of "What are we seeing? What is this?"
m61y | D.R .: Is it carrying everything-
u2ob | G.W .: Or is it nothing?
2gnm | Did your experience of the tornado change how you think about the ephemerality or materiality of your work? Because it is very possible, right now, to make music using software, and to store and release it digitally-so the experience, from start to finish, is never a tactile one, unless you count fingers on a laptop keyboard or a phone.
emgw | G.W .: I'm so grateful that it was tape. If a hard drive had gotten wet, it would have been toast.
xaqt | D.R .: I think we've spent a lot of time confronting that idea, thinking about how ephemeral everything is. I mean, that's a theme that runs through the music. So it wasn't an awakening, like, "Oh, I've never considered this." It was almost a reinforcement of what we've chosen to spend our lives thinking about.
5rcb | G.w .: There was a renewed courage at that point. The last vestiges of the room that weren't really tailored to what we do were wiped away. We were almost kids when
524j | we bought it, and we didn't change a lot of stuff. I had too much respect for the room. But now it is really our room, and tailored to the sounds we make.
xd3m | D.R .: We can do strings in the "A" room now, because it's become this big open space. And we were able to set up a new system where I can record without anyone else there, which means it can be even more intimate. Once we were back up and running, it had a beautiful lift to it.
8qb6 | With any kind of major loss, it seems as if there's always this little kernel of radical possibility on the other side. When everything is destroyed, you get to remake your life.
wkbn | G.w .: Though certain things you really don't want to rebuild. The night of the tornado, two of our main guitars were here at the house. When the sirens started going off, first we suited up-we put on boots. Don't want to be barefoot. And then we grabbed the guitars. We don't have a basement here, so I was in the hall bathroom with the two guitars, hugging the toilet while the tornado went overhead.
ftfg | Years ago, I wrote a book about obsessive collectors of very rare, prewar 78- r.p.m. records. I remember finding it so beautiful and poignant, so miraculous, that any of those disks had survived at all. Shellac is brittle; it shatters and chips easily. Holding some of those rare records in my hands, these utterly extraordinary recordings, I don't know, it reminded me that sometimes, stuff matters.
7xi5 | G.W .: Of course it matters! You're talking about art. You're talking about saving art, in the moment, when, in fact, your life is in danger. But you're gonna brave that danger.
w8r5 | Because there's an understanding that the art will outlive you? Not to minimize the human experience, but at least theoretically, art has an endless reach-
ybik | D.R .: It can last generations. I remember Robyn Hitchcock saying something to us a long time ago about how after a certain number of these records that we made, you're part of the cultural bloodstream.
gii5 | G.W .: It's in there.
q5eu | D.R .: I'd never thought of it that way. But I think anyone who makes art and shares it with other people-no matter how few people-has enacted a change. Even somebody who does a really good job building a front door to a house. When you walk through that door, it makes you feel different about the human experience. All of these things affect us. With art, you move to, "Well, is that thing useful, beyond the fact that when I see it on the wall, it makes my eyes happy?" And then you confront these large questions that we could talk about forever.
a7ao | G.W .: It's surprising to me, thinking about this very thing. More than ever I feel part of a musical continuum. I really feel the people who inspired and came before us. I was thinking about our song "Hashtag," which is at least partly about Guy Clark dying.
29a3 | D.R .: I think about John Hartford, and what it was like when we spent time with him when we first got to town. Thinking, I just want to live up to these people, and their contributions, and how they were as human beings when they were around the age I am now.
sb1e | G.W .: There was a particular and beautiful kind of reciprocity to it, too. Let's take Guy, for instance, or Hartford. I felt this joy from them. We were almost like their musical children. They could see their music moving forward in us, and they were so happy. They were so relieved. They were so grateful!
w2yn | David, I remember reading an interview with you in Rolling Stone, where you were talking about how folk music picks up a little bit of the DNA of everybody who has ever performed it. And, because of that, playing those tunes, it feels
ap6l | like there's a hundred people in the room-it makes a person feel less lonely. It's a pliable form, and you can always see the fingerprints.
iest | G.W .: A pebble in the river that's just been rolled and tossed and turned.
