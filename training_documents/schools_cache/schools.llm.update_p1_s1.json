While many leadership scholars have recently drawn attention to student diversity and the need for culturally responsive leadership, few researchers have theorized leadership from a Bourdieusian perspective. A Bourdieuian perspective explains leadership-student relations considering capital, fields, and habitus. We argue these concepts are essential for contemporary leadership theory, policy, and practice in diverse schools. Capital is at the core of Bourdieu's theory of social reproduction. He introduces the concept of habitus as the dispositions acquired through life experiences in different dimensions, and theorizes that the social world is divided into fields. Each field has a set of practices, and people who dominate and are dominated. Using habitus and field, researchers can examine the dispositions, traits, and practices of school leaders, as they operate across a number of fields, each with different power structures and properties. This chapter lays the groundwork for theorizing relationships among individual educational leaders and increasingly pluralistic communities so as to further inform empirical research. We construct a framework grounded in the theoretical logic of sociology beyond organizational and critical theories that explains relationships between leaders and students from culturally diverse backgrounds.\nepu7 | One. Changing Demographics, Changing Cultures, and the Need for a New Leadership Approach\n7od1 | The world is being reshaped by global migration. According to the data from the United Nations, there are more than two hundred fifty million migrants worldwide who are living outside of their birth countries. In twenty seventeen, about forty-nine point seven million people living in the United States were born in other countries. The United States Census Bureau projects the number of foreign-born United States residents will rise to seventy-eight point two million by twenty sixty. As the United States becomes more pluralistic, school leaders need to be prepared to lead schools with greater student diversity in ways that bring education and democracy closer together. If we are to fulfill the democratic prospect articulated by John Dewey, educational leaders must be able to mediate among culturally diverse individuals, schools, and communities.\n0bqy | Pierre Bourdieu was an influential social theorist of the twentieth century. In education, Bourdieu is best known for his theory of social and cultural reproduction. Bourdieu's research identified the central role that schools play in reproducing social and cultural inequalities. The work of Bourdieu is also useful for theorizing educational leadership. Bourdieu's theoretical approach sought to go beyond the structure-individual agency conundrum in sociology using his \"thinking tools\"-habitus, capital, and field. According to Lingard and Christie, Bourdieu provides \"a way through that central sociological conundrum and a way to allow for contextual constraints and individual possibilities within the work of principals\". Yet few researchers have theorized leadership from a Bourdieusian perspective using habitus, capital, and field. Habitus, capital and fields are concepts that we argue are essential for contemporary leadership theory, policy, and practice in diverse schools. Due to the changing demographics and culture of students attending public schools in the US, school leaders more than ever need to be aware of their own identity and how their self-concept impacts those who are following. Moll et al. drew on Bourdieu's notion of cultural capital, and Vygotsky to conceptualize funds of knowledge; however, leadership received little attention.\nb780 | We ask: How can we construct a framework grounded in Bourdieusian theoretical logics beyond the current literature that theorizes relationships between leaders and frequently marginalized students? How do we theorize leadership for education and social inclusion that explicitly considers the cultural background of the students in an increasingly diverse democratic society? In our view, such theorizing of leadership calls us to look beyond theories that explain practice from organizational or political theories alone. This chapter will lay the groundwork for theorizing relationships between the individual educational leader and increasingly pluralistic communities that might inform future empirical research.\nccmb | Two. Leadership Literature Over Time\nma93 | Organizational theorists influenced the educational leadership field with many empirical studies focused on relationships among the school or district as a micro-organization, leaders and other school participants, and the broader social, economic and political environment or context. For example, leadership scholars such as Hoy and Miskel synthesized organizational theories from business and sociology and applied these theories to the work of leaders in school organizations defined as systems. Here Hoy and Miskel explained relations between inputs and outputs. More recently, a growing number of educational leadership scholars have utilized various social theories to consider relations among social structures, politics, policies and schools. With an increasing plurality of students in educational organizations/schools worldwide, we see a significant need to bring these two strands of leadership literature into dialogue and theorize the relationships among the individual, school structure, and the broader society, including multiculturalism and multilingualism. In the following paragraphs, we further discuss leadership literature over time and then present a leadership approach that extends existing literature with deeper theorizing of culture.\nc6hh | Three. Organizational Theory Approach to Leadership\ny7ea | Hoy and Miskel argued that organizational theories evolved from rational to human relations to open systems approaches. A rational approach uses a formal organizational structure and ontology to define the role of organizational members. In a rational approach to organizational theory, administrators are managers or instruments for the attainment of formal organizational rules and goals. Natural systems perspectives emerged in response to rational system approaches to organization, positing that individuals in organizations do not always adhere to formal rules. According to natural systems theory, the informal structure of relations among participants is more influential in guiding the behavior of participants.\nnav4 | In addition to natural system theorists, some organizational theorists conceived organizations as open systems that combine both rational and natural system assumptions about reality. From this perspective, while schools are organizations that are shaped and defined by the actors within the local school, they also are shaped and defined by the larger societal context within which they exist. Empirical studies of leadership from an open systems perspective resulted in combinational leadership approaches within organizations. This included early approaches to management in transactional leadership and more relation-oriented and inspirational approaches such as transformational leadership that mediates the external and internal factors that contribute to organizational learning.\ngem8 | Many leadership scholars have used organizational theories to understand leadership in effective schools located in communities with a majority of families with lower socioeconomic status. For example, Hallinger and Murphy analyzed differences in the operation of school effectiveness factors in effective elementary schools of differing student socioeconomic status. Their findings indicate transformational leaders fostered a well-coordinated curriculum which emphasized the achievement of basic reading and math skills.\n```",
