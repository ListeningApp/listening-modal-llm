You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

8r5j | Role of the Endolysosomal System in Parkinson's disease

o3ya | Abstract
r5il | Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, affecting 1- 1.5% of the total population. While progress has been made in understanding the neurodegenerative mechanisms that lead to cell death in late stages of PD, mechanisms for early, causal pathogenic events are still elusive. Recent developments in PD genetics increasingly point at endolysosomal (E-L) system dysfunction as the early pathomechanism and key pathway affected in PD. Clathrin-mediated synaptic endocytosis, an integral part of the neuronal E-L system, is probably the main early target as evident in auxilin, RME-8, and synaptojanin-1 mutations that cause PD. Autophagy, another important pathway in the E-L system, is crucial in maintaining proteostasis and a healthy mitochondrial pool, especially in neurons considering their inability to divide and requirement to function an entire life-time. PINK1 and Parkin mutations severely perturb autophagy of dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy), both in the cell body and synaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons, leading to PD. Endolysosomal sorting and trafficking is also crucial, which is complex in multi-compartmentalised neurons. VPS35 and VPS13C mutations noted in PD target these mechanisms. Mutations in GBA comprise the most common risk factor for PD and initiate pathology by compromising lysosomal function. This is also the case for ATP13A2 mutations. Interestingly, a-synuclein and LRRK2, key proteins involved in PD, function in different steps of the endolysosomal pathway and target their components to induce disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss these E-L system genes that are linked to PD and how their dysfunction results in PD pathogenesis.

82qc | The endolysosomal system is increasingly recognized as the key pathway affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). Clathrin-mediated synaptic endocytosis, an integral part of the neuronal endolysosomal system, is probably the main early target. Autophagy, another important endolysosomal pathway that aids in maintaining proteostasis and a healthy mitochondrial pool is affected. Other crucial pathways such as endolysosomal sorting and trafficking, along with lysosomal degradation are also hampered. Key PD proteins such as a-synuclein and LRRK2 target the endolysosomal components to induce pathology. Here, we comprehensively discuss these mechanisms to better understand the role of endolysosomal system dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.

5746 | Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, clinically identified by motor symptoms, with an increasing recognition of non-motor manifestations (Hoehn & Yahr 1967; Chaudhuri & Schapira 2009). Loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (40-50%) and the presence of a-synuclein pathology in surviving neurons are the neuropathological hallmarks of PD. At the onset of motor symptoms, dopamine levels have decreased 60-70% in the dorsal striatum, where most SNpc dopaminergic neurons form synaptic connections (Dickson et al. 2009; Ma et al. 1997; Kordower et al. 2013; Fearnley & Lees 1991) . Under physiological conditions, a-synuclein is predominantly present in presynaptic terminals, aiding neurotransmitter release, whereas in PD, a-synuclein tends to aggregate and form Lewy bodies (the defining a-synuclein pathology in PD) (Spillantini et al. 1998; Spillantini et al. 1997). Aggregation of a- synuclein, perturbed proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired calcium homeostasis are the major cell-autonomous mechanisms of PD pathogenesis. Non-

dfzb | cell-autonomous mechanisms include cell-to-cell transmission of pathological a-synuclein and neuroinflammation (Poewe et al. 2017; Jyothi et al. 2015). So far, incomplete knowledge on causal mechanisms has limited treatment strategies to symptomatic relief. Recent studies targeting the endolysosomal (E-L) system reveal that its dysfunction can lead to the mentioned disease mechanisms, suggesting the E-L system as a key pathway in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss important E-L system components, their roles in neuronal survival, and how their dysfunction causes PD.
u6ty | The E-L system comprises of complex, highly dynamic membrane-enclosed tubular- vesicular structures with overlapping properties and functions (Klumperman & Raposo 2014). They facilitate nutritional intake from a cell's microenvironment through endocytosis, neutralize pathogenic materials via phagocytosis, promote cellular proteostasis through autophagy, and maintain overall cellular homeostasis through endosomal sorting and trafficking of various proteins/enzymes across organelles (Klumperman & Raposo 2014; Repnik et al. 2013). E-L system functions vary greatly depending on cell type and functional state. Neurons are unique in their highly polarized intracellular compartmentalization of cell body/soma and processes including axons, axon terminals, and dendrites. This organization enables them to form complicated networks that mediate specialized functions (Figure 1). This complexity comes at a price: burdensome demands on the E-L system, which have been increasingly implicated in neurological diseases including PD (Kett & Dauer 2016; Wang et al. 2018).
awvu | In neurons, synthesis of E-L components occurs primarily in the cell body/soma (Figure 1A). These components are trafficked through the secretory pathway to their subcellular location. A prime example of this is lysosomal hydrolase trafficking. Lysosomal hydrolases are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, then undergo glycosylation and other post- translational modifications at the Golgi apparatus [e.g. addition of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) groups] (Nixon & Cataldo 1995). This modification directs hydrolases to lysosomes. More specifically, hydrolases form complexes with transmembrane M6P receptors, which are sequestered into clathrin-coated vesicle (CCVs) budding from the trans-Golgi networks (TGN) to form endosomes/early endosomes (Nixon & Cataldo 1995) (Figure 1A). Inside early endosomes, M6P receptors detach from hydrolases and are recycled back to the TGN for their next round of transport (Saftig & Klumperman 2009), while hydrolases are delivered to lysosomes (discussed below).
on9b | Simultaneously, early endosomes are also derived from the cell surface through the endocytic pathway, an integral part of the E-L system. Many of the nutrients required for neuronal function and surface receptors designated for recycling are internalised through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) at the plasma membrane and delivered to early endosomes (Figure 1A). Early endosomes derived from both the TGN and the plasma membrane mature into late endosomes, where Rab5 and Rab7 play a prominent role (Saftig & Klumperman 2009). This process occurs with the help of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) (Figure 1A), which facilitates ubiquitin-dependent sorting of cargo/hydrolases from the outer membrane of early endosomes into interluminal vesicles

gy8c | (ILVs) (Wollert et al. 2009). Early endosomes derived from CME, if not sorted, follow a recycling pathway to the plasma membrane (Figure 1A) (Saftig & Klumperman 2009). ILVs are enveloped inside multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which mature into late endosomes. These late endosomes deliver their luminal contents either by forming tubular extensions or by fusing with pre-existing lysosomes to form endolysosomes (Luzio et al. 2007). These may be considered the final compartment of the endocytic pathway, where hydrolases degrade endocytic cargo and the membranes of ILVs for reuse (Klumperman & Raposo 2014; Saftig & Klumperman 2009). In addition, there is retrograde transport of receptors (such as M6P, Lamp2a, etc) from endosomes to the TGN for reuse through the retromer complex, comprised mainly of VPS35, VPS26 and VPS29 (Saftig & Klumperman 2009) (Figure 1A). Proteins that are meant for secretion follow a secretory pathway from the TGN (Saftig & Klumperman 2009; Klumperman & Raposo 2014). Selective capture and elimination of a cell's damaged organelles and misfolded proteins happens through a process called macroautophagy (termed hereafter as autophagy) (Ohsumi 2014), an integral part of the E-L system. Double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes encapsulate unwanted/ toxic cytosolic constituents including aggregated proteins and deliver them to the lysosome for degradation (Figure 1A) (Kawamata et al. 2008; Mizushima 2007). Non-selective autophagy also occurs during starvation, through which cells can recycle proteins and reuse amino acids for the synthesis of basic proteins essential for cell survival (Ohsumi 2014). Therefore, autophagy plays a pivotal role in housekeeping and maintenance of neuronal homeostasis.
y4mj | Customization of the E-L system for neurons mainly happens in axons (Figure 1B) and synapses (Figure 1C). At presynaptic terminals, vesicle precursors are delivered from the cell body and undergo vesicle cycling to form functional synaptic vesicles (SVs). However, delivery of new vesicle precursors cannot match the number of SVs undergoing exocytosis to achieve neurotransmission at an active synapse (Saheki & De Camilli 2012). This deficit is solved by highly responsive CME, recapturing fused vesicular membranes from the presynaptic membrane to form CCVs, which are in turn converted back to SVs through clathrin uncoating (Figure 1C) (Heuser & Reese 1973; Morgan et al. 2000; Saheki & De Camilli 2012). Less understood clathrin-independent bulk endocytosis (Holt et al. 2003; Wu & Wu 2007) and the "kiss and run" mechanism (Fesce et al. 1994) are also parts of the synaptic endocytic repertoire. In addition, there are dense-core vesicles (DCVs) derived from the TGN that are transported down the axons. Unlike SVs, DCVs do not participate in SV recycling and are primarily used to secrete long-acting neuropeptides (Nurrish 2014). While these processes are mostly confined to the presynaptic compartment, the E-L system's postsynaptic compartment contributes to membrane trafficking pathways primarily aimed at receptor, transporter, and ion-channel recycling (Rosendale et al. 2017).
vpgq | Though this complex E-L system allows a neuron to function far away from its site of protein synthesis, the neuron is beholden to anterograde transport of proteins and membranes synthesized and modified in the soma for maintenance of axons and the synapses (Maday et al. 2014). Furthermore, constant synaptic activity, especially in continuously firing neurons like SNpc dopaminergic neurons may result in considerable build-up of damaged organelles, membranes, and misfolded proteins. These need to undergo encapsulation by an autophagosome or endosome (Figure 1C) and retrograde transport to the

These spatial challenges to address a unique structural geometry, high metabolic demand, enhanced responsiveness to chemical/electrical stimulation, and the requirement for longevity due to their postmitotic nature, place a tremendous burden on the E-L system. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons have an additional burden in terms of long and highly branched axons, larger surface area, selective transporters for external toxins, large fluctuations in free Ca2+, less buffering capacity, and higher oxidative stress, reducing their threshold for degeneration (Surmeier et al. 2017; Vidyadhara et al. 2019; Vidyadhara et al. 2016; Vidyadhara et al. 2017). These vulnerabilities are further exacerbated with aging. Faced with environmental and genetic risk factors, disease pathogenesis abounds.
