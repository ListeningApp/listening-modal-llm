You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

d6sf | Introduction
7haq | Building on what we learned in Chapter 1, therapeutic use of self calls for a dynamic (i.e., ever-changing), personal, and subjective investment in the client during which the therapist makes moment-to-moment decisions about how to initiate and respond to the client's interpersonal char- acteristics and reactions to the inevitable events of therapy using six distinct communication approaches. This process of using one's therapeutic self is best summarized as in- terpersonal reasoning; it is a highly personal, individual- ized, subjective decision-making process that is grounded in the disciplined application of a set of concepts aimed
ubwu | The Intentional Relationship Model (IRM) guides occu- pational therapy practice by defining therapeutic use of self and thereby outlining an interpersonal reasoning pro- cess that therapists may apply when interacting with their clients. Each component of this model describes practical skills that may be applied during actual practice situations. The concepts and skills that comprise the IRM have been empirically validated and tested and are explained in greater detail in subsequent chapters. This chapter pro- vides an overview of the IRM so that readers understand how each of the components relate to one another within Taylor, Renee R ..

qnl5 | at meeting the client's interpersonal needs. Some may believe that the process is driven by one's emotional reac- tions to clients and an innate or nurtured intuitive capacity (i.e., reliance on one's "heart"). A smaller set of others per- ceive the process as largely rational and grounded in the disciplined application of a set of interpersonal guidelines.
wdx9 | Irrespective of such viewpoints, the IRM argues that therapeutic use of self is, in large part, a product of the extent to which one approaches practice intentionally, being ever-vigilant toward keeping one's personal reac- tions to a client in perspective and, instead, focusing one's attention on the client's reactions to us and to the therapy process. Therapeutic use of self involves prioritizing one's attempts to cultivate an empathic understanding of one's client and applying a knowledge base and interpersonal skill set thoughtfully to common interpersonal events,
n1xr | CASE EXAMPLE 3.1 Rigel Returns to Meet Mr. Johnson
ohpj | As we learned in Chapter 1, Mr. Johnson became depressed and withdrawn following a stroke. One of Mr. Johnson's most prominent interpersonal charac- teristics is his communication style, which tends to be guarded and reluctant. His first interaction with Rigel resulted in an interpersonal event cascade (i.e., more than one inevitable interpersonal event occur- ring in succession during a single session). This was because of a series of missed opportunities in not responding to Mr. Johnson's interpersonal charac- teristics and to the interpersonal events using the ap- propriate modes. As you may recall, Rigel decides to end the therapy session early and return another day.
ry5f | After a long evening of contemplation, Rigel returns to work with Mr. Johnson the following morning. This time, he applies interpersonal reason- ing by reflecting upon Mr. Johnson's most striking interpersonal characteristic, his communication style. Knowing that Mr. Johnson uses few words and largely communicates nonverbally, Rigel decides he will not engage with him in a way that would require him to speak a great deal. Also knowing that the interpersonal event of resistance had happened the day before, Rigel decided that he would need to be exceptionally careful about always communicating
31wg | such as when a client is not engaging in therapy appro- priately. Accordingly, therapeutic use of self is an occupa- tional therapy skill that must be developed, reinforced, monitored, and refined. One's personal and emotional re- actions to clients must be overseen by and balanced with a rational and self-disciplined application of almost selfless empathy toward the client.
celk | This chapter presents the IRM, a conceptual practice model that operationalizes the processes involved in ther- apeutic use of self. The rationale, conceptual background, and underlying principles of this model are presented. The model explains how components of the client-therapist relationship interact and are enacted in the face of every- day challenges to that relationship. Finally, this chapter presents a set of core principles that guide the implemen- tation of this model.
3mf9 | beginning the session with small talk, he decided to begin the session by using the empathizing mode.
z2rd | Instead of asserting any type of agenda for therapy that day, Rigel enters the room and simply greets Mr. Johnson by saying:
vqld | Rigel: "Remember me?"
ljmz | Mr. Johnson simply looks up to acknowledge Rigel. Rigel sits down at a bit of a distance, not facing Mr. Johnson. Rigel draws upon the empathizing mode by orienting his body at an angle toward Mr. Johnson in a nonthreatening way that would not imply any expectations or demands. After a few moments pass, Rigel uses the empathizing mode by making the fol- lowing summary statement, which opened a door for continued communication with Mr. Johnson.
en1l | Rigel (using the empathizing mode): "I was really fumbling around trying to offer something thera- peutic for you yesterday. I knew that I was heading in the wrong direction, so I thought I would come back again, today, just to acknowledge this."
45gx | Mr. Johnson makes an intimate self-disclosure: "It was not your fault."
xgur | ways I might be able to serve you. Today, we can begin wherever we want."
iz66 | Mr. Johnson says nothing and gives Rigel a curious glance.
dndq | Rigel then enacts the collaborating mode: "If you don't mind, I'd like to just spend our time together observing you as you go about your day. You can do or not do anything you want."
xzce | Mr. Johnson responds: "Nothing we do will make a difference."
w4vd | Rigel then shifts to the empathizing mode: "I want to understand why you believe this."
cuh0 | (Silence and a nonverbal cue from Mr. Johnson, who looks down and away from Rigel.)
k36t | Rigel continues in the empathizing mode: "I just want to get to know you and learn about anything that you might be thinking or anything that is im- portant to you."
z1wx | The session continues as Rigel observes Mr. Johnson pull out his smartphone and thumb through what appear to be photos of family and friends. After several moments pass, Rigel continues with the empathizing mode and observes:
o6gf | "I see that you are looking at photos."
