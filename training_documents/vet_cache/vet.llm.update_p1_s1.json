The history is certainly the most important diagnostic aid in medicine and the physical examination is easily second. The history is frequently key in determining cause of an illness, its significance, treatment options and even prognosis. Any clinician who fails to appreciate the value of a thorough history, who does not develop expertise in being able to obtain an owners' complete account of their concerns, or who takes \"short cuts,\" will create an environment for misdiagnosis or errors in therapy. As is true for any individual with expertise, practice is critically important. Repetition can improve history-taking skills if coupled with frequent self-assessments. This is an excellent method to avoid repeating errors. One can ask after any difficult diagnosis is confirmed, what questions should have been asked that were not? What did the owner know but was never asked? Could I have changed the formulation of a question to gain better insight? The excellent clinician is an excellent historian and excellent listener. The excellent clinician continuously works to improve his or her skill set.\nlrry | Obtaining a history is a \"process\" which should be approached in a methodical manner. This \"process\" should ensure that no valuable question is forgotten. Thus, the successful clinician has a group of questions consistently asked of every owner. Each question can be expanded or altered as dictated by answers given about the patient by the historian (usually the owner). In some cases, the order of questions may be changed. In other cases, answers provided may stimulate a subsequent set of questions. The clinician should always strive to be an approachable and compassionate listener. One will be well served by having the pet owner calm in order for her or him to provide clear and thoughtful responses. The medical history is a \"story\" about the patient. The following guidelines should assist with successful procurement of the patient's medical history.\nhvhm | THE APPROACH TO THE PET OWNER\n863b | ONE. Meeting a client for the first time forms the foundation for any relationship. The adage is true: \"You only have one\nfj24 | chance to create a first impression.\" In this scenario, the \"you\" includes the primary clinician plus all hospital employees, because \"the relationship\" often begins before the veterinarian ever meets a client. As a client enters your facility and meets the receptionist or any other employee, opinions are formed and trust may or may not begin to be established. Successfully placing a client at ease is much easier when all hospital employees are respected members of the veterinary team with the same goal of providing the best care for a pet and the owner. Owner and pet \"needs\" must be perceived as having highest priority.\nuz3c | TWO. Having every client completely comfortable in your presence is desirable but not easily achieved. Remember that with you being a complete stranger, a client may be insecure regarding your trustworthiness in caring for their pet. Many but not all owners prefer a warm, friendly, understanding, patient, and compassionate veterinarian. If an animal arrives in a life-threatening situation, the clinician may speak quickly and even go so far as to remove the pet from the owner in order to provide treatment. Once the patient is stable, the clinician should return to an examination room to obtain the detailed history and begin to build a client-doctor relationship.\nd5bi | THREE. Your greeting should inform the client who you are and in what capacity you function at the veterinary facility. Every clinician should be well groomed, speak clearly and use an understandable vocabulary.\nba4l | FOUR. Verify that the owner can understand what is being said or asked. Clearing any form of obstruction between you and the pet owner's ability to understand your questions is extremely important.\nffx8 | FIVE. Verify the patient's age, gender, neuter status, and breed (signalment), even if this information has previously been entered into the medical record. Incorrect data can be misleading and could cause disastrous outcomes in case management. Also, verify vaccination history, routine use of anti-parasite products, as well as all previously and currently used medications.\ns6su | SIX. The clinician should determine the relationship between the person to whom one is speaking and the pet. The more familiar an individual is with an animal, the more valuable their information. Next, one can inquire how long the person has \"known\" this pet. Have they lived in the same home for twelve years or have they been together for twelve days?\ny219 | SEVEN. When seeing an ill pet, the clinician will benefit from knowing when the animal was last \"normal.\" It also may be quite important to understand the owner's definition of \"normal.\"\n06ht | EIGHT. Owners of ill pets may be fearful and anxious. Stress can impair an ability to recall essential historical information. Remember that your patience should be a virtue. It might require you to repeat questions several times. Alternatively, one may inquire about a subject using more than one perspective or more than one question.\nv3r2 | REQUIREMENTS FOR A THOROUGH HISTORY\nnv42 | Box ONE-ONE lists the criteria necessary for obtaining a complete history. This box has been modified from a document created for physicians by the American Board of Internal Medicine. It seems obvious for the clinician to always try to ask the key questions pertinent to a specific primary concern or \"owner chief concern.\" However, typical issues caused by one disease will almost always overlap with observations associated with another. Although initial differential diagnoses based on signalment or another factor might steer the examining clinician to a correct diagnosis, it behooves the clinician to avoid \"tunnel vision\" in situations where another disease process might actually be responsible for the illness. Owner concerns or initial clinician suspicions are, therefore, always subject to misinterpretation. One objective of the medical history is to obtain an actual \"feel\" for what is clinically wrong with the animal based on owner-perceived issues. Some clinical signs are difficult to fully understand until either the owner or clinician actually imitates what is being seen or heard. One example is trying to determine if an owner is observing coughing, retching, reversed sneezing, regurgitation, or vomiting. It may be quite valuable to have an owner make a video record of an actual worrisome \"event.\"\nxags | In addition to questions integral to every history, specific clinical abnormalities may have a set of questions designed to help clarify the nature of a medical disorder. The reader is\njc47 | BOX ONE-ONE\nko3c | Competence in History-Taking\nxek3 | ONE. Develop the habit of recording a complete history.\nbbpr | TWO. Pursue with appropriate thoroughness all historical clues.\n5zyf | THREE. Establish rapport with the historian in order to obtain accurate information.\n9own | FOUR. Adapt language appropriately to ensure communication with the person available.\nbqfb | FIVE. Patiently adapt to clients who provide a disorganized history.\nwwdt | SIX. Develop a depth of knowledge that permits a thorough exploration of signs related to the patient's problems.\nmn1r | SEVEN. Have a depth of knowledge that permits consideration of the various causes that might explain the patient's signs.\n5vqw | EIGHT. Understand signs in terms of altered structure and function of the body systems.\nmeyw | NINE. Approach the history in a logical, directed way to ensure completeness.\n2e62 | TEN. Follow up medical clues in a directed logical pattern.\n75y3 | ELEVEN. Organize and record the history completely in a fashion that will be understandable.\ns2g2 | TWELVE. Be able to integrate signs into a diagnostic hypothesis while obtaining the history.\nq1q2 | THIRTEEN. Assess the reliability of the history obtained.\ncb7r | FOURTEEN. Separate irrelevant from relevant information appropriately.\n68xu | referred to each appropriate section in this text for a more detailed description of the diagnostic approach recommended for various \"owner chief concerns\" (Section TWO), \"physical examination abnormalities\" (Section THREE), and various \"clinicopathologic abnormalities\" (Section FOUR). The focus of this chapter is not to develop a \"history\" for each condition or concern, but to review the art of asking the right questions.\nhd35 | THE ELEMENTS OF THE HISTORY",
