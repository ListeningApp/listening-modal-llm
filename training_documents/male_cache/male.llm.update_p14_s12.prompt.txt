You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

m1hx | c) Factors Controlling Sertoli Cell Function
9psh | i) Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): The Sertoli cell has the receptors for FSH secreted by the pituitary gland, and this hormone stimulates the release of inhibin (alpha and beta subunits) by the Sertoli cell that feeds back to inhibit GnRH release, FSH release. and activin (an alpha-alpha or beta-beta homodimer of the inhibin subunits that stimulates the release of FSH).
aiqv | ii) Testosterone: Androgens are absolutely required for normal spermatogenesis, and the androgen receptors are located in the Sertoli cells. There are no receptors in the developing germ cells, and all actions of androgen are on the Sertoli cells.
4klz | Growth Factors and Cytokines, Small Peptides and RNAs provide the local controls of Sertoli cell function and spermatogenesis (for a review see Wu et al., 2019).
xz5d | d) Functions of the Sertoli Cell:
erwx | i) Supportive, protective and nourishing for the developing germ cells: The cell acts as a supporting matrix for the developing germ cells without having a permanent attachment to the germ cells. Sertoli cells also provide the germ cells with nutrients and may act as a "bridge" to bring substances from the capillaries to the germ cells. The hormones FSH and testosterone act directly on the Sertoli cells working through their cognate receptors to alter Sertoli cell function and impact the process of spermatogenesis.
ie7i | ii) Phagocytosis of residual bodies of excess cell portions during spermiogenesis (spermatid differentiation): Sertoli cells are capable of ingesting degenerating germ cells and residual bodies. The phagocytic activity becomes more pronounced following germinal epithelium damage and massive degeneration of the germ cells.
aksw | iii) Spermiation (The release of the mature spermatids into the lumen of the tubule.)
0fsl | iv) The number of Sertoli cells ultimately determines the spermatogenic potential of the testis in a normal man: Sertoli cell proliferation during the pre-pubertal phase is influenced by FSH and activin as well as thyroxin.
0m3g | v) The blood-testis barrier, like the blood-brain barrier, serves to separate the testes from the normal circulation of blood and other body fluids throughout the body. Proteins, which are abundant in blood plasma and testicular lymph, are present in very low concentrations in the tubule fluid, but only proteins secreted by the Sertoli cell enter the lumen of the tubule. Specialized junctional complexes (tight junctions) formed by neighboring Sertoli cells (see Figure 9) create an effective blood-testis barrier, which accounts for the differences in
9sp0 | chemical composition of the tubule fluid and the blood plasma or lymph. This barrier protects the sperm from the immune system and ensures that the fluid balance within the seminiferous tubule is conducive to sperm development. These complexes between Sertoli cells divide the epithelium into two compartments:
nbpk | (1) Basal compartment between the Sertoli junctions and the basal lamina containing the spermatogonia
xs3r | (2) Adluminal compartment above the Sertoli cell junctions containing the more advanced germ cells (Figure 9). The movement of leptotene spermatocytes from the basal to the adluminal compartment involves the blood-testis barrier. The formation of the blood-testis barrier might be required to establish an appropriate environment for the completion of meiosis.
ffuj | vi) Secretion of proteins and ions into the lumen: Tubule Fluid - The seminiferous tubules contain fluid which has a different composition from that of blood plasma or lymph. Sertoli cells probably are responsible for the secretion of this fluid. Its function is to transport spermatozoa to the epididymis and provide substrates for sperm survival.
h7f6 | (1) Inhibin - Sertoli cells produce this protein hormone, which specifically inhibits the release of FSH from the pituitary. Severe damage to the germinal epithelium results in decreased production of inhibin and subsequent increases in FSH secretion. The human male produces primarily inhibin B (see below).
t74k | (2) Secretion of müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS), also called anti-müllerian hormone (AMH). MIS/AMH inhibits the growth and causes regression of the müllerian ducts during fetal development and, thus, plays an important role during sexual differentiation.
qdn7 | Local factors: There is evidence for strong local control via growth factors and their receptors of spermatogenesis
dib4 | 1) THE LEYDIG CELL AND TESTICULAR STEROIDOGENESIS
yvqj | Leydig Cells: The Leydig cells are clusters of cells that occur in the interstitial tissue between the seminiferous tubules (see Figure 8). These cells comprise only about 5% of the total testicular volume. The Leydig cell synthesizes androgens from cholesterol (Figure 10 a, b). Androgens secreted from the Leydig cell regulate the development and function of the male reproductive tract and secondary sexual characteristics as well as promote spermatogenesis. The major androgen secreted is testosterone. Its synthesis and release is stimulated by pituitary LH. Leydig cells can synthesize cholesterol from acetate or take up cholesterol from lipoproteins for steroidogenesis. The rate limiting step for steroid biosynthesis is the mobilization of cholesterol from the intracellular stores to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is converted to the first steroid formed, pregnenolone. Although several proteins have been implicated in this process of cholesterol transport to the mitochondria, acute steroidogenic regulatory protein (StAR) plays a major role in regulated steroid production. A second protein (translocator protein
vz2f | or TSPO) has been implicated as a possible regulator as well. From pregnenolone, the Leydig cell produces testosterone via metabolism through the 44 steroidogenic pathway shown in
wyu0 | Figure 10 a and b. Testosterone is reduced in peripheral tissue by the enzyme 50 reductase to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
s8xw | In addition to androgens, the testis also synthesizes estradiol (via conversion of testosterone by the enzyme aromatase) and secretes significant amounts of estrogens. Estrogens may act intratesticularly to regulate testosterone production. This action may be mediated through estrogen receptors, which have been localized in Leydig cells.
afv1 | a) Characteristics and Location: The Leydig cells are located between the tubules in the interstitial space close to the blood vessels and lymphatics. The cells are characterized by:
fwf1 | (1) lipid droplets
3wck | (2) mitochondria with tubular cristae
jq2u | (3) a smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
9zf9 | (4) These cells express the receptors for LH, which stimulates steroidogenesis through a cAMP-mediated signal transduction pathway.
