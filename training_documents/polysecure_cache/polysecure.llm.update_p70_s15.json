Now walking around in a world that does not yet fully understand, respect or approve of them, these people are left to figure out how to ethically have multiple lovers without a clear guidebook to follow. The loss of monogamy's privileges and absence of the clear-cut path that it offers on how to navigate relationships can create new attachment ruptures and traumas, both anticipated and unanticipated. These ruptures can occur over the multiple dimensions of human experience that are presented in the nested model of attachment and trauma. The following section offers the different ways in which people can experience stress, trauma and attachment ruptures when they are practicing nonmonogamy. Some of these experiences are subtler, where difficulty and pain result from an accumulation of stressful experiences within the various levels, and other experiences are more overtly oppressive, traumatic or damaging of attachment. The examples that I share here are based on my own personal and professional experiences with CNM, insights from other mental health professionals specializing in nonmonogamous relationships, and Elisabeth Sheff's years of research on people in polyamorous relationships and\nuwfw | families. In Sheff's own words,\n0caz | Discrimination is hurtful action taken against an identifiable minority group, and anti-poly discrimination takes many different forms. Using data from my twenty-year study of polyamorous families with children, I compiled some of the ways in which polyamorous people report experiencing discrimination. It is important to note that many of the people in the research reported positive experiences with polyamory, from family members who fully embraced them, their partners, and metamours, to friends who welcomed the new chosen family members and employers who invited the entire polycule to the employee holiday dinner. People living in urban areas, especially in liberal states, reported less discrimination than people living in conservative and/or rural regions. Most respondents were middle-class white people and did not mention racial or class discrimination, though respondents of color did mention concern for polyamory to complicate their already challenging interactions with racism.\n4auz | I have seen firsthand the many ways that being non-monogamous can facilitate positive experiences with the friends, family and work, as well as how many new and unexpected positive experiences people have with partners, metamours and the new friends and family that come about from being nonmonogamous. That said, I've yet to meet someone who is openly nonmonogamous who has not experienced some form of judgment, criticism, rejection, discrimination or othering because of their lifestyle or orientation. Experiences can vary greatly in terms of severity and impact, and the intersectionality of being polyamorous with other forms of marginalization cannot be ignored or minimized. The nested model of attachment and trauma offers a framework to name some of these differences and how they have an effect at each of the different levels.\n6nou | THE NESTED MODEL OF ATTACHMENT AND TRAUMA APPLIED TO PEOPLE PRACTICING CNM\nxaqk | Self Level\na1ou | People who wake up to themselves as being nonmonogamous as an orientation\nzae5 | can have a similar coming-out process as people who come out as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Even though the realization that someone is nonmonogamous by orientation may come with much personal clarity, relief and alignment of who and how they are, the coming-out process can also bring with it an enormous amount of pain and confusion. Deconstructing monogamy, whether you identify as nonmonogamous by orientation or as a lifestyle choice, is not an easy undoing process for everyone. As people recognize the ways that mono-romantic beliefs have been internalized into their psyche, as well as how these ideas have influenced their actions and choices, regret and shame can arise. The experience can cause a person to question their own identity, uncertain about which elements still fit and which do not, uncertain as to exactly what authenticity and integrity look like for them now. Unable to rely on a sense of self for internal safety and security, these people can be left on shaky ground, often without sufficient support to navigate what can become a crisis of identity, a dark night of the soul or a complete reinvention of the self.\noa93 | Relationship Level\nlcuj | At the relationship level, trauma and attachment ruptures can arise from:\ncua2 | Your marriage or relationship disintegrating because you identify as nonmonogamous.\nuipb | You and your partner transitioning together to CNM, which you are happy about, but experiencing a real loss of the old relationship that the two of you had together. Even though you might still be together, the relationship has changed, and it's common to have grief about the past relationship with your partner that is no longer, as well as grief and loss about the monogamous future you had envisioned with them.\nbjno | Loss, rejection, estrangement, repeated judgment or criticism from friends and family members who you have come out to.\nw2lh | Being treated differently by friends and family who no longer want you to be around or alone with their spouse or kids because you are nonmonogamous.\nqryo | Being subjected to \"interventions\" from friends and family who are\nd0c0 | unaccepting of you being nonmonogamous.\nc4id | Feeling unsafe and afraid to come out to certain friends or family members because it may end the relationship or risk your future safety or security in some way.\n2fj6 | The loss and stress that can occur from no longer being number one to your partner.\n5mai | Breakups or the death of CNM partners, which are just as painful and difficult as breakups or deaths of monogamous partners. Because you have other partners, your friends and family may not recognize or acknowledge the significance of the loss.\npqyp | Falling in love with someone who then ends the relationship with you (often suddenly) because their other partner told them to or they decided to close up their relationship with their primary partner.\nnev2 | The loss of metamour relationships when your partner and the metamour break up.\nlo13 | Being unacknowledged, dismissed, stonewalled or mistreated by metamours.\n1gm9 | Needing to break up with a partner because they choose to stay in a relationship with other people who mistreat or abuse them, you, themselves or others.\n94yd | Partners making a unilateral decision that changes the structure of your relationship without your consent.\nox3w | Being subjected to vetoes or power dynamics from partners and/or metamours.\n2ai3 | Not having a say or voice in what things you can do, places you can go or sex acts you can experience with your partner because of rules and agreements that they have with someone else.\ndu4q | One of your partners enters into a new relationship with someone and they get more attention, time, access or social recognition than you do.\nv86a | Your spouse or primary partner has switched to non-hierarchical polyamory or relationship anarchy, but you still want to be primary partners so you lose\nexkc | the primacy in your relationship that you want.\nj83u | No longer having your partner as your primary safe haven and the person you can tell everything to and process everything with.\n6vco | Having relationship agreements or safer sex agreements being broken that compromise your health and safety.\nrnzk | Having to manage your partner's emotional roller-coasters or hurts from the other relationships they are in.\ndflu | Home Level\nyat3 | At the home level, trauma, discrimination and attachment ruptures can arise from:\ntp87 | Becoming a target from neighbors, housing associations or landlords because of being nonmonogamous.\n7wep | Evictions or denial of housing because you are nonmonogamous.\n```",
