You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

2e62 | Fig. 4. The effects of different pro-aging and anti-aging interventions on selected DNAm modules. Six DNAm modules respond to life span-related intervention experiments and are associated with the life expectancy of the mouse models. By contrast, the mammalian maximum life span modules do not correspond directly to the benefits or stress triggered by the intervention in the murine samples. (A) Changes in the intervention modules in the liver parallel smaller size and longer life expectancy of growth hormone receptor mouse models (GHRKO).

gem8 | findings suggest that expression of life span- related genes might be regulated to some ex- tent by pluripotency factors. This prompted us to investigate whether expression of any of the life span-related genes identified above are altered by transient expression of pluripotency inducing factors (Yamanaka factors OSKM) in a mouse model (39). Indeed, this analysis re- vealed that transient expression of OSKM al- tered the expression of 190 of 647 life span- related genes in skin and 162 life span-related genes in the kidney (nominal Fisher's exact <LATEX>P = 9 . 9 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 0 }</LATEX> for skin and life span; <LATEX>P = 4 . 5 \times</LATEX> <LATEX>1 0 ^ { - 2 5 }</LATEX> for kidney and life span; Fig. 5F and fig. S32). Genomic positions that are known to be bound by pluripotency factors in at least one human or murine cell type according to chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium are located near CpGs that are associated with maximum species life spans: NANOG-binding sites are enriched for CpGs that are positively corre- lated with life span <LATEX>\left( F D R = 0 . 0 0 2 \right)</LATEX> and to CpGs underlying the midnightblue module <LATEX>\left( F D R = \right.</LATEX> 0.0006), which has high methylation levels in long-lived species (Fig. 5G). OCT4 (POU5F1) <LATEX>\mathrm { \left( F D R \right. } = 0 . 0 2 ,</LATEX> and cMYC <LATEX>\left( F D R = 0 . 0 0 3 \right)</LATEX> bind- ing sites are enriched with CpGs in the green- yellow module, which has low methylation levels in long-lived species (Fig. 5G). The ChIP- seq binding location analysis also implicates other noteworthy factors such as POLII, CTCF, RAD21, YY1, and TAF1, which show the strong- est enrichment for negatively life span-related CpGs (Fig. 5G).
e8nr | Given the role of CTCF in regulating the three-dimensional organization of the genome, we conducted an enrichment analysis of topo- logically associating domain (TAD) boundaries and loop boundaries identified in both human and mouse cell lines (fig. S26). We found that both TAD and loop boundaries demonstrated significant enrichment of negatively life span- related <LATEX>\mathrm { C p G s } \left( \mathrm { F D R } = 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \right)</LATEX> for TAD bound- aries and <LATEX>\mathrm { \left( F D R \right. } = 6 . 7 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }</LATEX> for loop boundaries in various cell lines such as olfactory receptor cells and the human fibroblasts IMR90 and HFFc6 (fig. S26).
