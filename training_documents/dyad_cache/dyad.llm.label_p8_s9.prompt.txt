You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

yeoh | The issue at stake
b8hf | Relatively speaking, postwar Korea was terra incognita for American Far Eastern policy. Japan had been well-known since the time of Commander Perry's visit there in the mid-nineteenth century. Its conversion under MacArthur into a peaceful democratic state attracted much attention. Americans thought of rural life in China in terms of Pearl Buck's books, primarily the Good Earth, which also became a major film; these images of course involved wild distortions but many Americans were unaware of the misrepresentations. Extensive American resources, including more than two billion dollars in aid, were invested in Chiang Kai- shek's struggle to win the civil war in China. The Philippines had been an American colony since 1898, and the independent government that was established there after the Japanese occupation received US aid in its war against the Hukbalahap ("Huks") Rebellion.
hntf | In contrast, the Korean Peninsula that was occupied by Japan in 1905 had received very little attention in US policy. The summit meetings of Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam included only vague references to the future of Korea. Its occupation was left to the Soviets, who committed themselves to enter the war against Japan three months after the end of the war in Europe, primarily because Korea was considered to be a secondary target that did not justify the shedding of American blood. According to some reports, secretary of state Edward Stettinius had asked where Korea was during a meeting in 1945. And following Japan's surrender, the separation of the Korean Peninsula along the 38th parallel into two temporary occupation zones had been improvised within hours by two relatively junior officers on a National Geographic map.51
99fo | The remote role of Korea in American strategy during the war had undergone no change in the postwar years, when a tight order of priorities had to be built because of scarce military resources and new global commitments. Popular pressures to bring American soldiers home and the need to get the American economy back to peacetime production led to a fast demobilization process in 1945-46 and deep budgetary cuts. The 12-million-soldier army of 1945 had shrunk to 1,566,000 soldiers by June 1947, and defense expenditures dropped from 37.5 percent of the GDP in 1945 to 3.8 percent 4 in 1947. On the eve of the Korean War, the US Army forces in the Far East Command were made up of four tactical divisions and one regimental combat team, altogether amounting to fewer than 110,000 soldiers.53
y5r7 | The combination of strained resources, global commitments, and a strategic thinking that assigned no prime role to South Korea predetermined its fate. In May 1947, secretary of war Robert Patterson urged the evacuation of American forces from Korea for reasons of both the tight military budget and the relatively strategic insignificance of the peninsula. In September 1947, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)favored such an evacuation because "the United States had little strategic interest" in Korea and because in case of a general war, "our present forces in Korea would be a military liability." In June 1949, when the withdrawal of the American forces from Korea was to be completed, the Army chief of staff, Gen. Omar Bradley, raised doubts about the policy, but the consensus in the JCS reaffirmed it:
lrry | p. 138
hvhm | p. 139 The intelligence information and its estimate
863b | From the strategic viewpoint the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff regarding Korea, summarized briefly, is that Korea is of little strategic value to the United States and that any commitment to United States use of military force in Korea would be ill-advised and impracticable in view of the potentialities of the over-all world situation and of our heavy international obligations as compared with our current military strength.55
fj24 | Besides Bradley, there were others in the administration who tended to regard the Korean Peninsula as a strategically important asset. The CIA assessed that a Communist takeover of South Korea "would seriously diminish US prestige and adversely affect US security interest in the Far East." In addition to this political, economic and psychological damage, having Soviet bases in South Korea would allow the Soviets to launch "air, airborne, or amphibious attacks on Japan, Formosa and the Ryukyus, or submarine forays against shipping in Japanese waters."5 MacArthur himself was not too resolved on this issue. On the one hand, he said in private talks that he did not want to get involved in the "messy" Korean situation and estimated that in case of a serious challenge, the ROK would have to be abandoned. On the other, he told President Rhee during a visit to Seoul in August 1948 that "I would defend Korea as I would my own country, just 4 as I would California." But this commitment was no more than a gesture. Most soldiers in the Far East believed that "[t]here are only three things the troops in Japan are afraid of: Gonorrhea, diarrhea and Korea."58

d5bi | The political leadership accepted the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In April 1948, President Truman stated that military action in Korea would not be considered a "casus belli" for the United States." And secretary of state Dean G. Acheson's famous speech at the National Press Club on January 12, 1950, in which he defined the American "defensive perimeter" in the Pacific as a line running through Japan, the Ryukyus, and the Philippines, left South Korea and Formosa out of a US military guarantee. This may have influenced Stalin to approve the North Korean planned invasion. The administration's temporary failure to pass a $60 million Korean aid bill in Congress in January 1950, and public declarations such as the one given by Senator Tom Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who expressed in May concern about a Soviet occupation of Korea and Formosa, increased the impression that the administration was ready to accept the loss of these allies.61
ba4l | In the last months before the invasion, some efforts were made to limit this impression. Prominent among them was a special visit of roving ambassador (and later secretary of state) John Foster Dulles to Korea two weeks before fighting commenced. But altogether, its low ranking in the US strategic calculus between 1945 and 1950 meant that the Korean Peninsula received inadequate attention when it came to intelligence collection and estimation. The result was a poor level of intelligence collection, low quality of intelligence estimation concerning the looming threat and its nature, and lack of attention at the top decision-making level to the possibility that the next threat to United States' global interests would come in the Far East rather than Europe. At least part of this difference in the assessments of relative importance of Europe and Asia may have resulted from elements of racism within American leadership.62
ffx8 | As had been the case with Pearl Harbor, the source of the failure to provide high-quality warning against the KPA's offensive and its impact was insufficient intelligence information. But in December 1941, this intelligence gap had involved a specific issue: the fact that Pearl Harbor was the target of the Japanese attack. In June 1950, the gap was far wider: insufficient information about the KPA preparations for war and, even more important, no information at all about Kim's invasion intentions and Stalin's and Mao's reluctant acceptance of the move. In this sense, the mistaken American estimation of the North Korean threat was rooted in a wider misconception of the real nature of the Communist threat.
s6su | This misconception received a clear expression about two months before the war, in the first draft of NCS- 68. In essence, it regarded US nuclear capability as sufficient to deter the USSR until 1954, when the Soviet
y219 | nuclear arsenal was likely to reach 200 bombs. By the rationale of Paul Nitze and his colleagues, "the date the Soviets possess an atomic stockpile of 200 bombs would be a critical date for the United States, for the delivery of 100 atomic bombs on targets in the United States would seriously damage this country."63 This would mean that the United States would not be able to deter the USSR from initiating limited conventional wars; therefore such wars were more likely to occur after 1954. 64
06ht | This conceptual framework involved the assumption that the USSR under Stalin totally controlled the actions of its satellites and, hence, a communist military challenge to the West would be initiated only by the Soviet Union. Consequently, as Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway had put it, "By 1949, we were completely committed to the theory that the next war involving the United States would be a global war. The concept of 'limited warfare' never entered our councils." This frame of mind explains specific intelligence mistakes, primarily the underestimation of the KPA's capabilities; insufficient intelligence collection about a possible

nv42 | p. 140 invasion because of its low ranking in the priority intelligence requirements; and dismissal 4 of the available alarming information when it slowly came in, because "limited war" was not seen as a Soviet option, and therefore, the possibility of any other instigator of limited war was not considered.
xags | This combination of American judgmental errors played a similar role to that of Stalin's misperception of Hitler's intentions prior to Barbarossa. The variance between the two cases involved three elements. First, in the Soviet case, the mistake was Stalin's personally, while in the Korean case it involved all organizations and individuals who participated in the US intelligence and policymaking processes. Second, whereas on the eve of Barbarossa, the NKGB and RU had provided excellent information about the looming threat, on the eve of the Korean War, the US intelligence bodies almost completely failed in this task. Third, while the Soviets estimated quite correctly that the Red Army was not ready in 1941 for a war against the Wehrmacht, the Americans overestimated the military capabilities of the ROK and underestimated the force of the KPA. The result was that "there was the general feeling that if attacked from North Korea the ROK army would have no trouble in repelling the invaders."67
jc47 | Each of these failures had specific causes. The belief that the Communist block was highly monolithic relied on solid evidence concerning Stalin's iron rule at home and in Eastern Europe (with the exception of Tito's Yugoslavia). It paid less attention to the fact that Soviet control over its allies' actions in the Far East was lighter, although the CIA had noted the existence of sources of tension in the USSR-PRC relationship.6 Obviously, the fact that the American intelligence community had no high-quality source in the upper echelons of the administration in either the Soviet Union or the PRC and the fact that it lacked sufficiently experienced analysts for both states (not to mention North Korea) hampered its ability to correctly understand the context in which the decision to invade was made.
ko3c | The mistaken estimation of the balance of forces between the North and South Korean armies was the product of insufficient information from independent American sources about the buildup of the KPA. At the same time, American analysts believed that the South Korean reports on the KPA exaggerated its capabilities in order to convince the USA to provide the ROK with tanks, artillery and aircraft, which Washington refused to deliver for fear that it would encourage Rhee to attack the North. When it came to estimating the military capabilities of the South Korean army, which was trained by the Americans, there was a natural tendency to overestimate its capabilities. Gen. William L. Roberts, in charge of the KMAG and the 4 training of the ROK Army, gave a typical example in an interview to Time magazine three weeks before the war, when he defined the South Korean army as the "best doggone shooting Army outside the United States." There were other, more sober estimates of the quality of this army but they were less heard.70
xek3 | Finally, the failure to provide any warning prior the invasion can be attributed to a number of factors. Fundamentally, it was the mindset in the administration that ruled out the possibility of a limited war, whether in Europe or Asia. The information about KPA deployment for war was scarce, and since it mostly

9own | came from South Korean sources it did not receive sufficient American attention. Such reports came, moreover, against the background of an ongoing low-intensity conflict along the 38th parallel and, in many cases, were analyzed in the context of this conflict rather than a general war. And, most important, repeated warnings, in 1949 and in April and May 1950, about an incoming invasion that did not materialize created a "cry-wolf" syndrome that eroded the value any future warning." This defect influenced not only the Americans but also the South Koreans. Thus, on May 10, the ROK minister of defense warned that according to intelligence reports, the invasion was imminent. Two days later he told reporters: "Threats of invasion make us nervous but we are getting used to it. We don't get hysterical or panicky any more."72

wwdt | ii. Decision-making
mn1r | Since no specific intelligence warning was provided prior to the North Korean invasion, it was also not preceded by any significant discussion at the decision-making level. In this sense, the American failure of June 1950 constitutes a unique case. Prior to Barbarossa, Pearl Harbor, the Yom Kippur War and other cases in this category of events, there was sufficient intelligence about an upcoming attack available to at least trigger a discussion of the validity of the threat and how best to meet it. In June 1950, the hostile act was so unexpected that it only managed to provoke such a discussion after it started. 4
5vqw | On a flight from his home in Missouri to Washington, President Truman described his gut reaction to the news:
meyw | This was not the first occasion when the strong had attacked the weak. I recalled some earlier instances: Manchuria, Ethiopia, Austria. I remembered how each time that the democracies failed to act it had encouraged the aggressors to keep going ahead. Communism was acting in Korea just as Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese had acted ten, fifteen, and twenty years earlier. I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to over-ride nations closer to our own shores. If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threats and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors. 13
2e62 | Truman's advisers shared a similar mood. Upon arriving in Washington, Truman told secretary of defense Louis Johnson that he was going to "hit them hard." Johnson thanked him "in a voice broken with emotion." Acheson noted in his memoirs that by this stage, he believed that the attack had been instigated by the USSR "and that it would not be stopped by anything short of force."> Indeed, the discussions in the Blair House, which started immediately on Truman's return, reflected a high level of "intra-group solidarity" and "the finest spirit of harmony."" The decision to intervene in the war was taken shortly afterward without any objection.
