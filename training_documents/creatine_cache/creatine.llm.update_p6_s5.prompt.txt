You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

pmgl | The majority of dietary supplement survey data indicates that a relatively high percentage of youth and adolescent athletes are currently or have previously supplemented with creatine. For example, Kayton et al. [84] found that in a sample of 270 high school boys and girls, 21% of boys and 3% of girls reported supplementing with creatine. Further- more, in a sample of elite Olympic level sample of young German athletes (14-18 yrs), 12% of those surveyed re- ported supplementing with creatine [85]. Therefore, these trends warrant additional research to determine with greater certainly whether creatine supplementation, both acute and longer-term, is safe for children and adolescents.
90no | In summary, based on the limited evidence, creat- ine supplementation appears safe and potentially beneficial for children and adolescents.
jt0y | Does creatine increase fat mass?
qb7o | The theory that creatine supplementation increases fat mass is a concern amongst exercising individuals, pos- sibly because some experience a gain in body mass from creatine supplementation. However, randomized con- trolled trials (one week to two years in duration) do not validate this claim. Acute creatine supplementation (7 days) had no effect on fat mass in young and older adults; however, fat-free mass was increased [86, 87]. Furthermore, three weeks of creatine supplementation had no effect on body composition in swimmers [88].
oae5 | The addition of creatine to high-intensity interval train- ing had no effect on body composition in recreationally active females [89]. In addition, the effects of creatine supplementation during resistance training overreaching had no effect on fat mass [70]. Moreover, in a group of healthy recreational male bodybuilders, 5 g/day of creat- ine consumed either pre- or post-training had no effect on fat mass [90]. In other short-terms studies lasting 6-8 weeks, there were no changes in fat mass from creatine supplementation. Becque et al. [91] found no changes in fat mass after six weeks of supplementation plus resist- ance training. In another 6-week investigation, no sig- nificant differences in fat mass or percentage body fat were observed after creatine supplementation [42]. Fur- thermore, creatine supplementation during an 8-week rugby union football season also had no effect on fat mass [92].
s0fl | One might suggest that eight weeks or less of creatine supplementation is insufficient to arrive at a definitive conclusion regarding creatine's effect on fat mass. None- theless, there are several investigations that have used much longer treatment periods. For example, healthy resistance-trained males were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to supplement with creatine (i.e., 20 g/day for 1 week followed by 5 g/day for 11 weeks) or placebo [93]. Lean body mass and muscle fiber size in- creased; percent body fat and fat mass were unaffected over the 12-week training period [93]. In older males (~70 yrs), 12 weeks of creatine supplementation during resistance training had no effect (compared to placebo) on fat mass [94]. Furthermore, Gualano et al. assessed the effects of creatine supplementation (24 weeks), with and without resistance training, in older females. Results showed no effect from creatine on fat mass [95]. Candow et al. [96] examined the effects of creatine supplementation in older adults (50-71 years) over a 32- week treatment period. Study participants were random- ized to supplement with creatine or placebo before or after resistance training (3 days per week). There was an increase over time for lean tissue and strength with a de- crease in fat mass. From a clinical perspective, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who supplemented with creatine (0.1 g/kg/day) for two sequential periods of 16 weeks experienced a significant reduction in fat mass. In contrast, the children who did not consume creatine gained fat mass [97]. In two studies involving postmeno- pausal women, Lobo et al. [98] found no change in abso- lute or relative body fat from one-year of low-dose creatine supplementation. Furthermore, two years of cre- atine supplementation also had no effect on fat mass [99].
43ia | Recently, Forbes et al. [100] conducted a systematic re- view and meta-analysis on randomized controlled trials involving creatine supplementation in conjunction with resistance training on fat mass in older adults (≥ 50 yrs).
3g2y | Nineteen studies with a total of 609 participants were in- cluded. Participants supplementing with creatine had a greater reduction in body fat percentage. There was <LATEX>n o</LATEX> significant difference in absolute fat mass loss; however, the creatine group lost ~0.5 kg more fat mass compared to those on placebo.
gc7v | In summary, creatine supplementation does not increase fat mass across a variety of populations.
wqfv | Is a creatine 'loading-phase' required?
j30a | Pioneering research in the early 1900's using animal models showed that creatine supplementation could augment creatine content by 70% [101, 102]. Decades later, Harris et al. [60] published a seminal paper which showed that 'loading' with creatine increased skeletal muscle creatine stores, as evaluated from muscle biop- sies collected from the vastus lateralis in young, healthy human participants. This research sparked incredible interest in studying creatine supplementation strategies that would increase intramuscular creatine content, helping shape current recommendations.
7bdk | Creatine 'loading' is defined as supplementing with oral creatine for 5-7 days with a dosage of 20-25 g/day, often divided into smaller doses throughout the day (e.g., four to five, 5 g servings/day). Creatine 'loading' may also be prescribed relative to body mass, for ex- ample, 0.3 g/kg/d for 5-7 days (i.e., 21 g/day for a 70 kg individual). The 'loading' phase of creatine supplementa- tion is followed by a daily 'maintenance' phase often ran- ging from daily 3-5 g servings/day (Figure 1, side A). In addition to the seminal work of Harris et al. [60], several other investigations have demonstrated increased intra- muscular creatine stores in humans from the creatine 'loading' phase [35, 103, 104]. A common misconception regarding creatine supplementation is that individuals must 'load' with creatine to increase intramuscular
