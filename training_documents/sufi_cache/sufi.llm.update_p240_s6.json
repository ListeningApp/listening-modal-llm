        "content": "qvi5 | Literary passages, teaching instruments, may need much time and various experiences before they exercise their true potential effect upon the human being. In his Ruh al-Quds (Spirit of the Holy), Ibn Arabi tells how he was taught through a quotation from the Koran given him by Abu-Abdullah of Ronda, in Spain. This great Sufi, who had many extrasensory abilities, chose a passage and asked Ibn Arabi what it meant. The latter did not answer him, but when the meaning came to him he found Abu- Abdullah again and told him the answer. This was four years later. In conventional temporal terms, therefore, this one lesson had occupied four years. Since we have started publishing books of Sufi tales and encounters this kind of reaction has become more and more frequent from readers of the books: those, that is, who are not so impatient that they abandon the study as soon as it yields no immediate results of the kind which they demand of it.\njue2 | And, as Kalabadhi says in his Taaruf:\njlqb | Patience is to be patient with patience.\no0nx | Q: Should we not familiarise ourselves with all Rumi's work, especially as so much of it is now translated into English and other Western languages?\n2ywx | A: You should note that Rumi is talking to a specific audience. How do you know which part of what he says refers to you? In case of the extracts from the Koran which he uses so extensively. you can see that he is using them as a 'given', as you would use say, mathematical formulae. That is to say, he is talking to a community which accepts these extracts as literally and figuratively\nl5fk | This enables him to stress certain points and to drive home others. Dealing with a contemporary audience which either rejects these passages, or challenges them, or wants to analyse them, we cannot use them as our 'givens'. We have, instead, to refer to psychological data accepted by our constituency, and this is what we do. Doing otherwise would vitiate the value of Rumi's work as a whole. He, in turn, did exactly the same thing with the materials which he built into his writings.\n537q | Decline in Religious Influence\nf0dh | Q: Reading Sufi writings by the classical authors seems to show that there is a clear distinction drawn between religion and obsession. Is failure to observe this distinction the cause of current religious decline?\n1omh | A: The decline in the influence of religion has been due, in the main, not to religion itself, but to the very shallowness of many practitioners. People who are indoctrinated and mistake implanted obsession for faith, are themselves destroyers of the very thing which they imagine themselves called upon to try to protect.\nq26g | In fact, of course, they have no such call: and their capacity to protect something which is other than their imaginings makes for a comical situation.\n933w | What many people call religion (which is heavily admixed with self-deception, until it discovers the difference between inculcated belief and something else which might be called real faith) remains at a primitive stage of existence, and cannot really expect any serious consideration from people who are accustomed to thinking in the terms of thought outside it: terms which have long ago purged themselves of the grosser elements. Remember, sophisticated arguments and the ability to play with words do not add up to an advanced form of thought, only a cunning one.\n1f8w | Dedicated religionists such as we commonly meet are, of course, no more religious than an atheist. They are crude emotionalists who happen to have adopted religion as the field of their operations. Religion is their medium of action and expression: not the basis of their behaviour.\n8hd2 | In this respect they resemble more than anything else the political, economic or other cult-enthusiasts who are a psychological and social phenomenon, not a religious one.\n1d2u | Anyone who knows more and discusses 'religion' with such people would be like an astronomer discussing astrology with a star-worshipper.\n3r61 | For this reason the regeneration of religion would come from people whom we would not always readily associate with 'religion' as we know it.\n2epd | This principle is well known in other fields: where, for instance, great inventions come from the untechnical; since the main-line scientist and technologist has become obsessed with his field and its dogmas. Yesterday's dogmas are tomorrow's impossibilities.\ns3vc | In traditional terms, this is the condition of looking at the chrysalis when one should look at the butterfly: and also at the whole range of development, from egg to grub to chrysalis to butterfly.\n8d03 | I fancy - I certainly hope - that when people say, as so many do, that 'Christianity has not failed: it just has not ever been tried out' they mean that only the obsessionality or scholasticism have been tried. And if it has not been tried, might I enquire: When do we start?\ngkf2 | Remember, the first Persian book on Sufism-Hujwiri's, says:\ni8ee | 'The worst man is the one who is imagined to be serving God, but in reality is not: the noblest is the one imagined not to be a devotee of God, who really is such.'\nytl0 | The cause of religious decline is that so few people have the opportunity of the alternative to implanted obsession-a frail thing-represented by the faith which comes through experience. The Sufi Muhammad ibn Khafif said: 'Faith is believing in the heart in the knowledge which comes from the Unseen'. He did not say that it was believing in something said to one, or drilled into one, or admitted at moments of excitement and consequently becoming part of a fixation.\nay5i | Why he is still normal\ns9yy | There is a wry joke in the East, aimed at stressing how the decline in religion is due to the ineptitude and sometimes worse of the practitioner, especially at the supposedly higher level of the activity. Like a cartoon, it is deliberately over-emphasised, to make the point:\nt2rk | A spiritual teacher is saying:\nsarn | 'My first disciple was so weak that the exercises killed him. My\nu9zp | second drove himself mad by doing his meditations too concentratedly. My third pupil became dulled by contemplation. But the fourth is still completely normal.'\ng7bf | Someone asked: 'Why is that?'\n187h | 'It could be', said the guru, 'because he refuses to do the exercises ... '\n6l3h | Why cant we have a British Karakul Lamb?\n1rjw | Karakul, sometimes known as Persian lamb, is the fur of a sheep which has for ages flourished in Central Asia, notably in Afghanistan. More recently, attempts have been made to rear the Karakul sheep in South-West Africa, and their skins are marketed as 'South-West African Karakul'.\nd3u9 | Because of nutritional and environmental factors, there is a difference.\n72fw | Experts and others can tell the difference between the two kinds of skin.\ngy8f | There are many reasons why we cannot grow a Karakul sheepskin in Britain, in spite of the fact that there is a demand for them.\neulx | But the fact that they are brought into this country from outside does not decrease the demand. On the contrary, it probably increases it. It certainly increases the price.\nkyf9 | If anyone were to say: 'Why can we not have a British Karakul skin?' the foregoing remarks would probably be what he would be told by an expert-\nq995 | Suppose we use this example to illustrate, however partially, my remarks that something which belongs to one culture should not-in the metaphysical sphere-be imported into another? Am I not importing something from another culture, or even series of cultures?\nospy | It must immediately be noted that the relevant factor here is whether the import belongs uniquely to the culture from which it was imported, or whether it does not.",
