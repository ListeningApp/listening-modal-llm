        "content": "pse1 | Some of the different factors that can contribute to a child adopting an avoidant attachment style are: eighteen\n9wyj | . Isolation through too much time alone or not enough face-to-face time with parents.\nhmko | . The absence of physical or emotional presence from caretakers.\ntsxi | . Too much emphasis on task-based presence. That is, where caregivers are only present when they are trying to educate or teach something to their child that is practical, academic or skills-based.\nfidk | . Too little touch and affection, or what Diane Poole Heller calls \"skin hunger.\"\nju2k | . Emotional neglect where emotional nourishment is low or absent and parents are unable to effectively read the child's signals. Such parents might respond in insensitive ways or be completely unresponsive to the child's emotional states and needs.\nwldo | . Expressive dissonance, which is when someone's facial or verbal expressions\nct9a | are mismatched with their emotional states. Someone might be laughing when they are angry or smiling when they are actually upset, which can be confusing to children (or anyone for that matter). Since children are learning how to identify and express their own emotional states through the modeling of the adults around them, a parent with expressive dissonance can create challenges in their child's ability to understand others' feelings and to express themselves in ways that are socially appropriate and authentic.\nrh8p | . Disrupted engagement with caretakers due to illnesses or other factors that interfere with either the child or the parent participating in bonding attachment behaviors.\nvopc | . Rejection from parents that might be ongoing, subtle or even outright abandonment of the child and parental responsibilities.\nk4qz | . Parents who are overly strict and controlling.\nk3w9 | . Parents who might have the best intentions, but have a child who is so different from them that they are unable to understand or connect with that child in attuned ways.\nlijr | Dismissive Attachment as an Adult\n43dz | In adulthood, the childhood avoidant style is referred to as dismissive. A person who is functioning from a dismissive style will tend to keep people at arm's length. Usually priding themselves on not needing anyone, people with this style will tend to take on an overly self-reliant outlook, valuing their hyper-independence and often seeing others as weak, needy or too dependent. Although they may present as having high self-esteem, people functioning from a dismissive attachment style often project unwanted traits onto others and inflate their sense of self to cover a relatively negative self-image. People with this attachment style have reported lower levels of relationship satisfaction, trust and commitment, as well as having more negative views about sex and lower levels of sexual satisfaction when married.\nfyrt | A person with a dismissive attachment style likely didn't get what they needed early in life from their primary caregivers, so they learned to get by and survive by\n2nsv | needing little to nothing from others. When someone grows up in a home with minimal or no emotional nourishment, it makes sense that they would deemphasize the value and importance of relationships, and that they find it extremely difficult to be vulnerable and open with others. Oftentimes, their own painful emotions or experiences are placed below the radar of their emotional awareness in order to avoid the discomfort of feeling pain. This in turn creates a disconnection from their own feelings and needs. Living with a sense of chronic disconnection from themselves, others and the world, they might at times experience the longing to be close, but then feel at a total loss as to how the bridge the gap between their isolation and others, missing opportunities to receive support from their partners or to provide care to their loved ones.\nuqlj | People in this attachment style do want relationships. They will enter into relationships, even long-term relationships, but may struggle with their ability to reflect on their own internal experience as well as sensitively respond to the signals of their partners. They usually find it difficult to tolerate emotions related to intimacy, conflict and different forms of emotional intensity. When someone who is functioning in this style either feels vulnerable or perceives vulnerability in their partner, they will distance themselves to avoid discomfort. Signs of potential rejection or criticism from others will also create a quick withdrawal.\n013l | People with the dismissive attachment style will also tend to be highly linear and logical, showing many forms of competence and ability in the practical or professional realms of life. This overdevelopment of the logical brain can also create challenges with certain aspects of autobiographical memory-people with a dismissive attachment style might have little memory for childhood experiences, as well as simplistic narratives about their parents and childhood being \"just fine.\"\n4flw | In my therapy practice, I often notice that people who are relating from the dismissive style initially describe their parents or current romantic relationships as being great, even ideal, but just a few minutes of deeper questioning into their actual childhood experiences or current relational patterns reveals that things aren't actually so perfect. This occurs because the deactivation of their attachment\npzyx | system has made it difficult for them to access and consistently stay in touch with their true feelings. For many, contacting and admitting one's actual feelings might be perceived as a threat to their current relationship or to the status quo of their family of origin.\nqc4k | Part of this deactivating and distancing adaptation is the dissociation from lived experience. When someone with a dismissive style starts to work on healing their insecure attachment, they must begin by no longer dismissing and distancing from themselves. This requires that they no longer deny their desires and needs, allowing the longings and wants for connection that have for so long been forbidden. When someone functioning from a dismissive style starts to allow their attachment system to come back online, it can initially be a very tender, raw and even overwhelming process. The skills that come with being able to identify your own feelings are part of a developmental process that takes time. The process of allowing feelings as they arise, learning how to self-soothe and establishing an inner trust that experiencing feelings is safe, cannot be rushed.\nbtsb | For the dismissive style, the journey from insecure to secure attachment is one of returning to the body through bringing feelings and sensations back to life and learning how to be with oneself in this process. Once this is established, the risk of then leaning into others, revealing one's internal world, and dismantling the self-reliant exoskeleton through asking for help and care from others can begin.\ns1u0 | Statements that someone with a dismissive attachment style might make:\nju0a | . My autonomy, independence and self-sufficiency are very important to me.\ne4y0 | . I am generally comfortable without close relationships and do well on my own.\nkpra | . I want to be in relationships and have some closeness with people, but I can only tolerate closeness to a limit and then I need space.\negbi | . I prefer not to share my feelings or show a partner how I feel deep down.\nbnhs | . I frequently don't know what I'm feeling or needing and/or I can miss cues from others about what they are feeling or needing.\nktv2 | . I feel uncomfortable relying on partners and having partners depend or rely\nwoy6 | on me.\n6xev | . I either struggle with making relationship commitments or if I do commit, I may secretly have one foot out the door (or at least have the back door unlocked).\nu2ud | . I am very sensitive to any signs that my partner is trying to control me or interfere with my freedom in any way (and I don't like the word \"sensitive\").\n3qum | . I see myself or others as weak for having needs or wanting comfort, help or reassurance.\nobst | . During disagreements or in conflict I tend to withdraw, shut down, shut out or stonewall.\n3mg9 | . I do well with the transition from being together with people to then being alone again, but once I've been alone for a while I can be slow to warm up to others or struggle with the transition from being alone to entering back into connection with someone.\n4j8f | The Anxious/Preoccupied Attachment Style\ne3ba | Anxious Attachment in Childhood\n```",
