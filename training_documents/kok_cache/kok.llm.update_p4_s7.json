        "content": "kpvt | Leaf spots used for measurements were punched out, and leaf discs were measured for light absorption, STS-VIS miniature spectrometer; Ocean Optics, Dunedin, Florida, United States, twice per disc, to represent average absorption at this spot. After measuring their areas, leaf discs were dried in a seventy degree Celsius oven for twenty-four hours to determine dry matter. Each dry leaf disc was then ground into powder, and samples of one to three milligrams were analyzed for nitrogen concentrations with an EA one thousand one hundred eight CHN-O Element Analyzer, Fisons Instruments, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States using the Dumas combustion method.\njie2 | Data and modelling analyses\nd0ik | All the leaf spots had a similar nitrogen content. The average leaf nitrogen was one point six grams per meter squared and average leaf absorptance was eighty-five percent. Variation among replications was small, and replicate average values were used for analysis.\n0x0s | Deleted.\n4exe | Begin array two five, one five, two five, three zero, three five. Data of A versus I sub absorbance were inspected to identify the irradiance at the Kok transition point, I sub absorbance sub U, based on the highest average r squared of linear regression on points both below and above the candidate I sub absorbance sub t of each curve. The regression slopes below and above I sub absorbance sub t were denoted as b sub one and b sub two, respectively, and the b sub one to b sub two ratio was calculated. The intercept of the regression after I sub absorbance is the day respiration estimated by the Kok method. Here, the intercepts of regression lines before and after I sub absorbance sub t are denoted as r sub d one and r sub d two, respectively. According to the original interpretation of the Kok effect, r sub d one is equivalent to the respiration rate in the darkness,\n0myz | R sub d k. To examine if the decrease of phi sub two with increasing I sub absorbance could partly explain the Kok effect, plots of A versus I sub absorbance P two were made. To be compared with the A minus I sub absorbance plots, data points were allocated according to I sub absorbance sub t identified earlier, and linear regression slopes both below and above I sub absorbance sub t were denoted as B sub one and B sub two, respectively. Any decrease in the B sub one to B sub two ratio, relative to the b sub one to b sub two ratio, would suggest that the decrease of phi with increasing I sub absorbance could partly explain the Kok effect. The intercept of the linear plot of A versus I sub two b c phi sub two divided by four after the Kok break point is the day respiration estimated by the Yin method. As the intercept remains unchanged if the linear plot is made here for A versus I sub absorbance power phi sub two, the intercepts of A minus I sub absorbance phi sub two lines before and after I sub absorbance sub t are denoted as R sub D one and R sub D two, respectively.",
