You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

qrvy | Indonesia/Ethiopia, we excluded case reports, non- English and non-human studies, and papers with terms for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), latent TB, gamma interferon (IFN-y) release assay (IGRA) and tuberculin skin test in titles because of their relevance to TB infec- tion, not active pulmonary TB. Searches were conducted between 19 October 2020 and 26 October 2020. Finally, to inform remaining parameters, we sought opinion from TB experts from each country (authors AB and MG for Ethiopia and NK and RT for Indonesia) in an iterative process using a questionnaire, and remote workshops to explain the model and focus on parameters identified as influential by one-way sensitivity analysis. More details are provided in online supplemental appendix 1 (literature search) and online supplemental appendix 2A (model parameter estimation).
pn9j | Cost parameters and health economic approach
1pmc | We collected costs (reported in 2019 USD) from the healthcare provider's perspective and adjusted histor- ical costs for inflation to 2019 prices using relevant gross domestic product (GDP) deflators.19 We transferred costs from other countries to Ethiopia and Indonesia by applying relevant purchasing power parity conversion factors.20 All costs were assumed to accrue in the present, with no discounting applied.
5z6q | We assumed the cost for the initial TB assessment at the PHC was equivalent to the country-specific cost of two outpatient visits (or a single outpatient visit for reas- sessment) to a health centre (health centre with no beds from WHO-CHOICE estimates21). Similar assumptions were used for hospital assessment and reassessment with the corresponding WHO-CHOICE cost estimates.21 The cost of bacteriological investigation in the SOC includes the country specific unit cost of either SSM2223 or Xpert, depending on availability at each level of care, adding the unit costs for collecting two sputum samples for testing with SSM or one sample for testing with Xpert. The unit costs for Xpert were estimated based on country specific data available from the OneHealth Tool (see online supplemental appendix 2B).24 Country-specific unit costs for collecting sputum samples were not available and are based on a study done in adults from South Africa.25 In the intervention, we applied the unit cost for collecting a single stool sample based on estimates provided by the Paediatric Operational Sustainability Expertise Exchange group.20 Treatment cost for diagnosed TB comprises the cost of anti-TB drugs (including pyridoxine), from the Global Drug Facility,27 the costs of follow-up visits (drug pickups or medical review) according to national TB treatment guidelines at the healthcare facilities based on WHO-CHOICE unit cost estimates, and the costs of labo- ratory monitoring in bacteriologically confirmed TB only (see online supplemental appendix 2B (overview of cost parameters)).

99fo | Nations Population Division country-specific life tables. A simple mean across ages included in the 0-4 and 5-14 year age groups was used, and decrements in health-related quality of life or subsequent survival were not modelled.
y5r7 | Metrics calculated
lrry | For every 100 children seeking care with presumptive TB in each country, we calculated the deaths, DALYs, costs, referrals, clinical assessments, bacteriological assess- ments, ATTs, percent of true TB receiving ATT, percent of those receiving ATT bacteriologically confirmed, percent of those receiving ATT initiated at PHC, percent of ATT that is false-positive, as well as the change in these quantities under the intervention. We report the incre- mental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). For each country, we produced plots of the cost-effectiveness plane, cost- effectiveness acceptability curve, and expected net benefit, and tornado plots illustrating the one-way sensi- tivity of outcomes to influential model parameters. We also undertook specific scenario analyses: (1) we consid- ered a low TB prevalence scenario (half the base-case prevalence among presumptive TB patients); (2) we considered Xpert as the universally available bacteriolog- ical test instead of sputum-smear microscopy in SOC; (3) we considered discount rates of 0% and 5% for the life- years. The results of these sensitivity analyses are included in online supplemental appendix 3 (additional results). Results are presented following the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards Statement (online supplemental appendix 4).

fj24 | RESULTS
uz3c | Following our review of the literature, we developed the model parametrisation shown in table 1. The data sources and approach to synthesis for each parameter are described in detail, respectively, in online supplemental appendices 1 and 2A. Country-specific data were used to inform the proportion of children submitting a spon- taneously expectorated sputum sample, the fraction of presumptive TB in children under 5 years, and the level of initial care-seeking at PHC. We used existing systematic reviews for the basis of parameters describing diagnostic test accuracy, our own pooled estimates of true TB prev- alence among presumptive TB, the fraction of TB that is bacteriological confirmable and the fraction of chil- dren able to spontaneously expectorate. Evidence for the accuracy of clinical diagnosis was limited, and published evidence was completely lacking for other parameters around referral and reassessment. Hence, we based these on expert opinion. Unit costs used in the analysis are shown in table 2.

s6su | The intervention increased the sensitivity to detect true TB by over 10 percentage points in each country and resulted in around a fourfold increase in the propor- tion of patients with TB diagnosed that are bacteriolog- ically confirmed. Specificity showed little change under the intervention (<1% change). In both countries, the proportion of children referred (or self-referred) to higher levels of care after seeking care at PHC level fell by more than twofold. In both countries, the average total number of assessments for children with presumptive TB increased from around 2 per child under SOC to around 2.5 per child with the intervention, and the total number of bacteriological investigations increased more than threefold (table 3).
y219 | The relative number of children initiated on ATT increased by 19-25% under the intervention. A larger fraction (~40% relative increase) of children received ATT with the intervention, and more children (~10% point increase) initiated ATT at PHC level (table 3). Restricting to children under 5, we found bigger increases in the number of bacteriological investigations (+30-fold), and the proportion of TB cases diagnosed that are bacteriologically confirmed (+50%). We also found a larger reduction in referrals of children with presump- tive TB to higher levels of care in both countries (almost threefold) (see online supplemental appendix 3 (addi- tional results)).
06ht | In both countries, the increase in sensitivity of a TB diag- nosis under the intervention generated a corresponding reduction in mortality: a 14-20% relative reduction in the fraction of children with presumptive TB dying (table 3). In both countries, costs increased under the interven- tion, and the base-case (using smear microscopy in the SOC) ICERs were US$132/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$94/DALY averted in Indonesia (figure 2). Restricting the analysis to children under 5 years resulted in cost savings with ICERs of US$-78/DALY averted in Ethiopia
v3r2 | and increased the ICER to US$209/DALY averted in Indonesia.
nv42 | Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses
xags | Model projections showed large uncertainty (figure 2) that included cost savings under intervention (25% of the runs for Ethiopia and 28% for Indonesia), but also some increases in mortality (1.2% of the runs for Ethiopia and 2.8% for Indonesia). At a cost-effectiveness threshold of 0.5×GDP our analysis projected a probability of being cost effective of 87% in Ethiopia and a 96% in Indonesia (see online supplemental appendix 3). The corresponding probabilities for a 1xGDP threshold were 95% (Ethiopia) and 97% (Indonesia). Tornado plots (figure 3) show that prevalence of true TB among presumptive TB, the sensitivity of stool, and the fraction of children able to expectorate were the largest drivers of uncertainty (see also online supplemental appendix 3).
jc47 | Under the assumption that Xpert was used in the SOC, the ICERs were US$138/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$115/DALY averted in Indonesia. Assuming half the prevalence of true TB among patients with presump- tive TB changed the ICERs to US$145/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$150/DALY averted in Indonesia. Finally, assuming a 0% discount rate changed the ICERs to US$55/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$38/DALY averted in Indonesia, whereas 5% discount rate gener- ated ICERs of US$199/DALY averted in Ethiopia and US$142/DALY averted in Indonesia.

cop0 | aged <5 years, we found a 14%-20% relative reduction in mortality driven by an increase in sensitivity to detect true TB. However, it is crucial that clinical assessment is still undertaken alongside negative bacteriological test results because bacteriological testing has a low negative predictive value especially in young children.34 Relying on bacteriological testing alone can reduce sensitivity to diagnose true TB and increase mortality, especially if referrals and re-assessments are common under the stan- dard of care (data not shown). We estimated ICERs of US$132 and US$94 per DALY averted in the base-case analyses for Ethiopia and Indonesia, respectively. These ICERs are less than 0.5×GDP, which has been suggested as a rule of thumb for cost-effectiveness thresholds,28 as well as country-specific estimates of supply-side thresholds. 29 30 The intervention would be especially cost-effective for children under 5 years of age.
lhkq | Children age <5 years are at higher risk of dying from untreated TB than older children and have the greatest difficulty in spontaneously expectorating sputum. Under the intervention, we found greater increases in bacteri- ologically diagnosis and greater decreases in referrals in the <5 years age group (see age stratified results in online supplemental appendix 3). We found that the cost of introducing the intervention was partially offset by reduced referrals from PHC facilities to hospitals. In Ethi- opia, this produced a projected cost saving in the under 5 age group, despite a slight increase in the average total number of assessments done. In taking a healthcare provider's perspective, we did not include patient costs in
82ju | 8
y2qo | our analysis, but health-seeking costs are a major driver of catastrophic costs in TB.31
1piq | There are large uncertainties associated with many parameters describing processes and pathways for paedi- atric TB. We found no directly applicable estimates of rates of reassessments or (self-) referral at different stages of care, and had to rely on expert opinion. Addition- ally, the sensitivity and specificity of clinical assessment for paediatric TB is poorly quantified in the literature. Because of this, we placed a particular emphasis on including uncertainty in results, as well as systematically exploring their sensitivity to one-way variation in param- eters, and discrete alternative assumptions. For example, because our estimate of true TB prevalence among chil- dren with presumptive TB was based on data mainly from hospitals which may have higher prevalence than PHC level, we halved prevalence resulting in increased ICERs by less than a factor of two without changing our quali- tative conclusions. Despite these uncertainties, the inter- vention showed probabilities of being cost-effective >85% in each country across a wide range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. This conclusion was also robust to assuming the SOC used Xpert rather than sputum-smear micros- copy at PHC level, and to different choices of discount rate.
7fqw | Some aspects were deliberately simplified or omitted in the modelling. First, we did not model HIV because paediatric HIV rates in Ethiopia and Indonesia are rela- tively low at 0.09% and 0.03%,32 respectively. This may underestimate the benefit from the intervention due to underestimated TB mortality, especially if stool-based
