You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

tv8z | 709 controls, which likely suggests that other mechanisms besides ApoE are at play in controlling
wj6v | 710 neuroproteasome localization. It is therefore an open and important task to define the milieu of
ax4d | 711 molecular and cell biological factors that can influence neuroproteasome localization. Detailed
gtbn | 712 characterization of such mechanisms may help understand whether and how neuroproteasomes
ui4d | 713 contribute to the large diversity of phenotypes in Tauopathies and neurodegenerative disease.
2h4x | 714
0s3f | 715 Along these lines, ApoE has large effects on both amyloid deposition and Tau aggregation based on neuropathological data (124). Future work will determine whether and how neuroproteasomes
1ajd | 716 can impinge on the amyloid pathway, if at all.
qj5b | 717
15wh | 718 In the broadest sense, we find that neuroproteasome localization and function is a determinant
ad3x | 719 for the proteostatic capacity of neurons to defend against protein aggregation. A major
6zdx | 720 conclusion of our work is that neuroproteasome-specific inhibition induces the formation of
lwg2 | 721 endogenous Tau inclusions, suggesting the neuroproteasome is a pivotal mechanism in
zsvp | 722 determining Tau aggregate formation. This function is notably distinct from the canonical role of
ssmj | 723 proteasomes in protein clearance. Sarkosyl-insoluble Tau aggregates formed by neuroproteasome 724 inhibition in neurons are endogenous, without a need for pathogenic mutations. We suggest that 725 this may be important for Tau aggregation observed in a high percentage of sporadic AD patients
nda1 | 726 who do not have genetic lesions in the MAPT locus. It will likely be important to determine how
5mk0 | 727 neuroproteasome inhibition-induced endogenous Tau aggregates compare to other types of misfolded Tau.
5bgd | 728
m3bl | 729
7ul5 | 730 One of the key observations we make is that new protein synthesis is necessary for
1b57 | 731 neuroproteasome-inhibition induced Tau aggregation. Taken together with the dramatic increase
rwom | 732 in newly synthesized Tau protein following neuroproteasome inhibition, we propose two models 733 to explain our observations (Fig S7D): one, that neuroproteasomes degrade newly synthesized
w1qt | 734 Tau, or two, that neuroproteasomes indirectly regulate the translation machinery itself. The latter
emp6 | 735 is unlikely because only ~500 proteins increase after neuroproteasome inhibition, which suggests
vm2i | 736 some degree of specificity of what is regulated by neuroproteasomes. Based on the small number
u7au | 737 of neuroproteasome substrates (4) and even smaller number of proteins which we identify in this 738 study which become insoluble, we suggest that the model that neuroproteasomes degrade Tau to
1ti5 | 739 be the most likely option. While further experiments are needed to determine which is accurate,
vpp5 | 740 our observation that newly synthesized and endogenous Tau forms aggregates following
y9yd | 741 neuroproteasome inhibition is likely to be an important finding for the field. Indeed, if newly
rwaf | 742 synthesized Tau is a neuroproteasome substrate, future analysis would determine if Tau
xbze | 743 mutations or Tau seeding would perturb the balance of protein synthesis and degradation. This
p2wh | 744
uzhc | would be an important cautionary consideration for using these common models to study
f2h2 | 745 neuroproteasome-dependent Tau aggregation.
8z32 | 746
0yaq | 747 As a concluding note, our findings increase the urgency to understand fundamental aspects of
o21p | 748 neuroproteasome biology. For example, revealing the genetic and cell biological elements which
0g5c | 749 control neuroproteasome localization and trafficking are likely to be critical to reveal how ApoE
ql4n | 750 exerts an effect on neuroproteasome localization. The majority of the other components
eyg6 | 751 identified are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane trafficking (NSF, COPI,
00l8 | 752 Vps35 and Sorl1, AP2 and AP3). We believe this reflects the underlying cellular mechanisms for 753 regulating localization of these complexes to the plasma membrane, a subject for future study.
ojx3 | 754 Understanding these, as well as related mechanisms like how newly synthesized proteins are
7o0d | 755
7atk | degraded by neuroproteasomes, are likely to open up therapeutic avenues that can impinge on
opr3 | 756 neuroproteasome biology to boost neuroproteasome dependent-proteostasis and delay or prevent protein aggregation.
