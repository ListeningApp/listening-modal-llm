        "content": "li40 | The sub-subgoal: explain entropy from the ground up, and compute the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator:\nirr1 | : k ( In Ka kT +1\nsvwi | how\ncym3 | Okay, now we know the entropy of a classical ideal monatomic gas! We even know what it means. Unfortunately we're trying to figure out the entropy of hydrogen, which is diatomic. But we can do helium, which is monatomic ... and then we'll do hydrogen.\n7y4b | ENTROPY PER MOLE VERSUS BITS PER MOLECULE\n421l | A nat of unknown information is one point three eight zero six four nine times ten to the negative twenty-three joules per kelvin of entropy: this is Boltzmann's constant.\nart6 | There are six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-three molecules per mole: this is Avogadro's number.\npsk5 | Thus, one nat of unknown information per molecule corresponds to\natv6 | one point three eight zero six four nine times ten to the negative twenty-three multiplied by six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-three approximately eight point three one four four six three joules per kelvin of entropy per mole.\n9ja4 | A bit is natural log of two approximately zero point six nine three one five nats, so one bit of unknown information per molecule corresponds to about zero point six nine three one five multiplied by eight point three one four four six three approximately five point seven six three one four six\nbl6w | joules per kelvin of entropy per mole.\nrxoj | Here is a little fact we need now: one bit of Shannon entropy per molecule equals about five point seven six joules per kelvin of Gibbs entropy per mole. I apologize for the oppressively large number of decimal places above, but I want to compare our theoretical predictions of the entropy of helium and hydrogen to experimental results, and it's not clear yet how closely our answers will match experiment, so it's good to be prepared.\nb2rk | By the way, the values of Boltzmann's constant and Avogadro's number here are exact, fixed by the definition of SI units. So there is no experimental uncertainty in any of the numbers on this page.\npros | THE ENTROPY OF HELIUM: THEORY\ntlrm | The Sackur-Tetrode equation says that assuming helium is a classical ideal monatomic gas, its entropy is\n6gxm | S sub i approximately k N left parenthesis natural log fraction V over N Lambda cubed plus fraction five over two right parenthesis which corresponds to\n7eaf | natural log fraction V over N Lambda cubed plus fraction five over two nats of unknown information per atom. At standard temperature and pressure, this gives about fifteen point zero four one nats or\nt890 | fraction fifteen point zero four one over natural log two approximately twenty-one point seven zero zero bits of unknown information per atom.\nnwqa | Now let's calculate the entropy of helium in its gaseous state. NIST has tabulated its entropy at standard temperature and pressure, specifically temperature T equals two nine eight point one five Kelvin and pressure P equals one bar, so that's what we'll try to calculate. An atom of helium has a mass of m equals six point six four six four seven seven times ten to the negative twenty-seven kilograms, so at standard temperature its thermal wavelength is\nsewa | Lambda equals fraction h over square root two pi m k T approximately fraction h over square root left parenthesis two pi multiplied by six point six four six four seven seven times ten to the negative twenty-seven kilograms multiplied by one point three eight zero six four nine times ten to the negative twenty-three joules per Kelvin multiplied by two nine eight point one five Kelvins right parenthesis approximately five point zero five three seven two one times ten to the negative eleven meters.\n0tlp | For a mole of an ideal gas we have N equals six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-three (this is Avogadro's number), and at standard temperature and pressure a mole of ideal gas has V approximately zero point zero two four seven eight nine six cubic meters: this is called its 'molar volume'. The molar volume of helium is actually slightly different from this, because helium is not an ideal gas: the atoms interact. But since we're doing a calculation assuming helium is a classical ideal gas, let's ignore that for now. We then get\nbz3j | fraction V over N Lambda cubed approximately fraction zero point zero two four seven eight nine six cubic meters over six point zero two two one four zero seven six times ten to the twenty-three multiplied by left parenthesis five point zero five three seven two one times ten to the negative eleven meters right parenthesis cubed approximately two seven nine six six three. We thus have\n14mv | natural log fraction V over N Lambda cubed approximately natural log two seven nine six six three approximately twelve point five four one. As explained earlier, this means that the logarithm of the number of accessible states of each helium atom would be twelve point five four one if it were trapped in its own small box of volume V over N. But density fluctuations contribute one extra nat of entropy per atom. Thus, the\n75iu | free energy part of the entropy per atom is thirteen point five four one nats. On the other hand, the expected energy part of the entropy per atom is two, coming from the atom's three momentum degrees of freedom. The total entropy per atom is thus\na82u | In A3 plus one plus approximately one NA three\ntx0t | fifteen point zero four one\n2zty | nats.\n63ho | To impress our friends we can convert this to bits: we divide by natural log of two and get about\n32zi | fifteen point zero four one\n59si | zero point six nine three one five approximately twenty-one point seven zero zero\ni30e | bits of unknown information per atom of helium.\ntvst | I've kept only five significant figures in the later stages of these calculations, since that's how precise the experimental data is. Next let's compare the final result to experiment!\nwrky | THE ENTROPY OF HELIUM: EXPERIMENT\n2my1 | The entropy of helium at standard temperature and pressure has been measured to be one hundred twenty-six point one five joules per kelvin per mole.\n8ql6 | One bit of unknown information per atom corresponds to about five point seven six three one joules per kelvin of entropy per mole.\n07fv | Thus, each atom of helium at standard temperature and pressure carries about one hundred twenty-six point one five\nkg0h | approximately twenty-one point eight eight nine\npl1f | five point seven six three one\nwavb | bits of unknown information.",
