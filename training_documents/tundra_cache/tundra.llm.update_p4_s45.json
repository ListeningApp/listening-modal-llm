The majority of plot locations were established in advance using a stratified random scheme to ensure inclusion of wide ranges of slope, aspect, elevation, and glacial history across all footprints. An additional forty-seven plots were collected in the course of visiting the stratified random plots, to capture a wider range of shrub characteristics, and ninety-two more plots were collected in twenty fifteen to represent additional shrub types and vegetation across topographic transects. For each of these seven hundred thirty-one total field plots, we took nadir photographs from approximately one meter height using a standard point-and-shoot consumer digital camera, capturing roughly one by one point three meters of ground area. We also recorded brief notes at each plot describing plant species and surface features present in the plot and the general area, including vegetation height measured using a meter stick; thaw depth measured using a steel thaw probe; and moss plus organic soil depth, measured using a meter stick after slicing a slit in the moss or organic mat with a serrated knife. The center coordinates of each plot photo were precisely measured using a TopCon GR three survey grade GNSS system operating in real-time kinematic mode.\ns2g2 | Two point three. Reference plot classification\nq1q2 | This area has benefited from previous vegetation classification efforts, in particular by the Alaska Geobotany Center at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, which has produced a hierarchical series of maps for the area depicting multiple landscape features. These include vegetation maps that provided a\ncb7r | valuable benchmark for this project. Vegetation classes for the Alaska Geobotany Center maps were established using the Braun-Blanquet classification approach, in which species associations are grouped into a hierarchy of successively broader units. The classification system has the potential to precisely describe the finely heterogeneous vegetation community distribution of the Toolik Lake area, but the maps have limited or absent map accuracy information, and are polygon-based rather than raster, with varying minimum mapping units that necessarily simplify the distribution and arrangement of vegetation patches on the landscape. Since it was desirable that the final map classes in this project correspond as well as possible with legends used on previous maps, preliminary vegetation classes for this project were established by examining communities described in available maps and literature. To assign each plot photo to a plant community, photo order was randomized, and each photo was visually examined. Based on plant species and other features visible in the photo, as well as plot notes, each plot location was assigned to the class that best described the center of the photo, where GNSS coordinates had been measured. Because it wasn't yet clear how well we would be able to distinguish vegetation classes in the final model, initial class assignments were as granular as possible, to permit more flexible subsequent grouping. Finally, sixty-nine additional reference plots locations were selected from the orthophotos, to provide more reference data for gravel pads, blockfields, and open water classes that were underrepresented in the field data but could be confidently identified in the orthophotos.\n68xu | Two point four. Input data layer processing\nhd35 | A total of thirty-three predictor variable layers at twenty centimeters resolution were derived from the airborne lidar and RGBN imagery using a variety of tools. Most layers fall into three general categories: lidar-derived canopy metrics, lidar-derived topographic metrics, and first-order imagery metrics. Additionally, there is one compound layer, shrub biomass, which was derived previously using lidar canopy metrics and NDVI and downscaled to twenty centimeters resolution for use here. We also included lidar return intensity, which acts as a surface metric. The raw intensity of near-infrared fifteen hundred nanometers laser returns is affected by surface characteristics, especially wetness, surface roughness, and the presence of green vegetation, making it a potentially valuable predictor of surface features and vegetation distribution. Although our intensity data are not radiometrically calibrated or normalized, the intensity response showed few flight-line artifacts, and the nonparametric nature of the Random Forest modeling approach permits the inclusion of raw, uncorrected data. All predictor metrics were selected to be ecologically meaningful for Arctic vegetation distribution, as well as being likely to improve prediction of vegetation characteristics based on previous work.\n2zpk | Owing to the prevalence of noise in data layers with such high resolution, most layers were smoothed using a circular mean Focal Statistics filter. This type of smoothing retains the original spatial resolution, but tends to improve classification predictions by decreasing the impact of meaningless local variation, instrument noise, and small shadows. We initially processed layers at several smoothing distances, but we only retained layers that appeared important in preliminary models and had a Spearman correlation less than zero point ninety-five at the reference plot locations. Once the layers were prepared, the values of all predictor layers at the location of each reference plot were extracted for model training and validation.\nepu7 | Two point five. Random forest modeling\n7od1 | Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses ensembles, or forests, of classification or regression trees. In a Random Forest, each tree selects and permutes random subsets of predictor variables at each splitting node, which reduces overfitting and improves the strength of predictions. Additionally, Random Forest is non-parametric, models local interactions naturally, and is relatively robust against the collinearity common to ecological variables, making it an effective tool for ecological research.\n```",
