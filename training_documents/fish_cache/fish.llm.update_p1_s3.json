The largely mid-water and domestic fisheries catch upwards of two hundred thousand tonnes each year and are managed jointly by the United States and Canada. Pacific hake migrate along the coast each year, typically spawning near the southern end of their range in the winter. Their movement, growth and reproductive success are all heavily dependent on environmental conditions along the coast. Pacific hake are an important part of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem along with being a key target for North American west coast fisheries.\niat7 | Nine point two Stocks\nywwr | Three or more biologically and genetically distinct stocks of Pacific hake occur along the west coast of North America. These stocks include the large coastal stock and smaller, spatially restricted inshore stocks, one within Puget Sound and another in the Strait of Georgia. A 'dwarf' Pacific hake stock had previously been recognised off Baja California but is now considered a separate species. Here, we focus on the large coastal stock of Pacific hake, which is the most abundant groundfish population in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. The majority of this population migrates annually from offshore of southern California and Mexico at approximately latitude thirty to thirty-five degrees north during the winter spawning season to coastal areas as far north as Haida Gwaii, formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands, at latitude fifty-three degrees north or, in some years, southeast Alaska approximately fifty-eight degrees north, during the spring, summer and fall. Although there is thought to be little overlap in time and space among hake stocks, recent research supports the hypothesis that hake from the separately managed inshore stocks overlap with the large coastal stock, particularly in the summer. Gao et al. found evidence of two stocks of hake off the Washington coast based on isotopic signatures in the core of otoliths. This finding is consistent with Puget Sound or Strait of Georgia stocks being found throughout the Strait of Juan de Fuca and near the northern-western tip of Washington. In addition, King et al. reported genetic evidence, supported by differences in biological parameters and parasite infection levels, of three separate stocks of resident Pacific hake in Canadian waters. They also found that there was likely mixing of inshore resident stocks and the coastal stock during the summer, especially\n0i6j | in Queen Charlotte Sound where the Canadian fishery operates to varying degrees each summer. On the basis of these two studies, mixing of inshore resident and migratory coastal stocks occurs in some, if not all years, resulting in some harvest of resident Pacific hake by the fishery targeting the coastal stock. The exploitation level of inshore stocks is likely dependent on the relative population sizes of coastal and inshore stocks and their spatial distributions in any year.\n87cq | Nine point three Biology, life history and ecology\n0qs3 | Nine point three point one Environment\nz8f7 | Pacific hake reside primarily within the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Climate and ocean conditions affect the distribution and abundance of coastal Pacific hake throughout its life history. The California Current exhibits spatially complex and temporally varied flow dynamics. During the spring and summer, northerly wind stress drives coastal upwelling and southward surface flow, while in fall and winter, southerly wind stress leads to downwelling and northward surface flow. Along Vancouver Island, the large volumes of freshwater discharged from coastal rivers onto the continental shelf result in northward surface flow in the summer as well. The California Undercurrent, a subsurface northward flow, exists year-round on the continental shelf and upper slope, at a varying proximity to the shelf break. The Undercurrent is nearly contiguous from latitude thirty-three degrees to fifty-one degrees north, with a relatively narrow core of ten to twenty kilometers at depths of two hundred to three hundred meters where mean sustained velocities of ten to twenty centimeters per second have been recorded. Upwelling brings cool, dense and nutrient-rich waters to or near to the surface along the coast, increases the productivity of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem and contributes to favourable feeding areas for Pacific hake during the summer months.\n7w7j | Climate forcing at inter-decadal, for example regime shifts, and inter-annual time scales, for example El Ni単o or La Ni単a events, affects the distribution and productivity of marine species within the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. Regime shifts, detected from coincidental changes in the distribution, survival, and abundance of many marine plankton and fish species, occurred in nineteen twenty-five, nineteen forty-seven, nineteen seventy-seven, nineteen eighty-nine and nineteen ninety-eight. These shifts represent relatively abrupt, widespread and persistent changes in productivity, with effects cascading through all trophic levels. Within these regimes, ocean conditions are affected by El Ni単o events, resulting in warming of coastal waters offshore of the shelf-break and stronger poleward flow in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, and La Ni単a events, that couple cooling of surface temperatures with reduced poleward flow. A warming trend detected in all global oceans accounts for\n51vd | a one-degree Celsius increase in average annual water temperature in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem over the past fifty years. This warming is likely to have widespread consequences for the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem, including the patterns in spawning, recruitment, abundance and distribution of the coastal Pacific hake stock that we describe in this chapter. King et al. concluded that warmer years would likely reduce recruitment success for Pacific hake and or result in a northward shift in spawning and rearing areas. However, increased upwelling could increase euphausiid density at the continental shelf break resulting in increased growth of Pacific hake, while warmer conditions would likely result in farther average northward migration and development of resident stocks farther north as well.\nbaj1 | Nine point three point two Embryos and larvae",
