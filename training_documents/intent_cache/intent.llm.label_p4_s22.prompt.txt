You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

99fo | As shown, the occupational therapist employs several therapeutic strategies, usually rooted in existing models of practice, to facilitate the client's engagement in occupation. Depending on the occupational needs, capacities, and di- agnosis of the client, any number of occupational therapy practice models might be employed alone or in combina- tion to promote occupational engagement. However, this main task of promoting occupational engagement through employing the specific methods and strategies of occupa- tional therapy does not exist in isolation of a larger process of relating that occurs between client and therapist.
y5r7 | The IRM explains the relationship between client and therapist that is part of the overall process of occu- pational therapy. Accordingly, the model is intended to complement existing occupational therapy conceptual practice models rather than to replace any single model. It explains the detailed and overarching aspects of the client-therapist relationship, an aspect of occupational therapy not addressed by other practice models in as much detail or as the sole focus. Figure 3.3 shows how the intentional relationship is designed to supplement the use of other occupational therapy conceptual practice models. As shown, the IRM should complement the usual concepts and strategies of occupational therapy that are directly aimed at facilitating occupational engagement.
lrry | The model's utility for occupational therapy lies in addressing the otherwise unarticulated aspects of the

If a therapist utilized only this model, the essential work of occupational therapy would not occur. Instead, the model was designed to fill a gap in our practical knowledge about how to manage the interper- sonal aspects of therapy, particularly the more challenging ones. This model should complement the field's existing methods and models by making the process of establish- ing a successful relationship with clients easier, clearer, and more straightforward. The next section defines the ele- ments of this model and provides an explanation of how the elements interact to optimize the circumstances for a suc- cessful client-therapist relationship in occupational therapy.
ba4l | Elements of the Intentional Relationship Model
ffx8 | The IRM views the therapeutic relationship as being comprised of four central elements.
s6su | 1. The client's interpersonal characteristics
y219 | 2. The inevitable interpersonal events that occur during therapy
06ht | 3. The therapist's use of self (i.e., mode use, interpersonal skill base, and ability to apply interpersonal reasoning)
v3r2 | 4. Occupational engagement, which is viewed as the mechanism of change

xek3 | A summary diagram of the model is presented in Figure 3.4. The model explains the requirements for a productive client-therapist relationship. It incorporates guidelines for responding to each client's unique interpersonal char- acteristics and to the interpersonal events that commonly occur during therapy. The relevant aspects of each ele- ment of the model and their relations with one another are described in the section that follows.
bbpr | The Client's Interpersonal Characteristics
5zyf | According to the IRM, achieving an empathic understand- ing of the client is the focal point of effective use of self
9own | (rather than the client's) to develop a working and predict- able communication with the client and to respond appro- priately when interpersonal events occur. To develop this relationship and respond appropriately to the client, a ther- apist must work to understand the client from an interper- sonal perspective. This involves getting to know the client as an interpersonal being. The IRM calls for us to understand the most salient interpersonal characteristics of our clients as they present themselves during occupational therapy.
bqfb | The IRM asks us to strive to know our clients' inter- personal characteristics and behaviors within 14 catego- ries. The most critical aspect of understanding our clients as interpersonal beings involves a therapist's recognition of characteristics that make it more challenging to com-

5vqw | Table 3.1 The 14 Categories of Interpersonal Characteristics
meyw | Interpersonal Characteristic Example
2e62 | Communication style A hyperverbal client talks so much that the therapist feels that there is no room for a response.
75y3 | Tone of voice An authoritative client speaks in a low and tense tone of voice, clipping her words.
s2g2 | Body language A client folds his arms and casts his eyes downward.
q1q2 | Facial/postural expression (affect)
cb7r | A client's lips are pursed and her shoulders are tight when she recol-
68xu | lects a conflict that occurred with her daughter just before the accident.
hd35 | Response to change and challenge
2zpk | Each time he is presented with something new, a client admits that he is not sure he will be able to perform the task.
epu7 | Level of trust A client watches the therapist with a cautious expression and occa- sionally appears uncomfortable with certain personal hygiene activities, questioning the purpose of engaging in these activities.
7od1 | Need for control A client appears unconcerned about therapy, does not have any goals, and passively complies with all instructions.
0bqy | Approach to asserting needs
b780 | A client is cold and would be more comfortable if she had her sweater, which she left in another room. She shivers through the rest of the ses- sion because she does not want to impose on or interrupt the therapist.
ccmb | Predisposition to giving feedback
ma93 | A client drops hints about what he would rather be doing but cannot come out and suggest to the therapist that they do something different.
c6hh | Response to feedback A client has been disruptive and disrespectful toward others during a group therapy session. When the therapist informs the client of how she is experiencing the client's behavior, the client bursts into tears and abruptly leaves the room.
y7ea | Response to human diversity A client comments to the therapist that he looks very young and, despite the therapist having introduced himself as "Dr. Yamamoto," the client asks him when he will be graduating and to whom he is reporting.
nav4 | Orientation toward relating A client does not respond to the therapist's attempts to break the ice with small talk and, instead, asks the therapist about the treatment agenda and expected outcomes.
gem8 | Preference for touch A therapist innocently places a hand on a client's shoulder in an attempt to reassure her during a cooking task. The client immediately recoils from the therapist's touch.
e8nr | Interpersonal reciprocity At the beginning of the session, a client asks the therapist how her day is going, and at the end of the session, the client reminds the therapist of how instrumental she has been during the rehabilitation process.

f682 | 14 categories of interpersonal characteristics. Each cate- gory may be a product of the situation (i.e., situational) or a more stable interpersonal style (enduing). Each char- acteristic is accompanied by an example of what would indicate a need for closer attention from the therapist.
li1k | Our understanding of each of these characteristics should not be approached from a strengths versus liabili- ties perspective; the IRM is not interested in stigmatizing or pathologizing clients. Instead, the IRM calls for us to understand the interpersonal characteristics of our clients that may be most salient in terms of facilitating or inter- fering with the client's ability to do one or both of the following:
pbea | Effectively communicate and relate to the therapist
ccpt | Engage in whatever occupation is the focus of therapy
0fpw | According to the IRM, each of these 14 interper- sonal characteristics may also be understood along two dimensions:
dqn8 | Situational
cop0 | Enduring
lhkq | Situational Interpersonal Characteristics
82ju | When one or more of the 14 client interpersonal char- acteristics referenced in the preceding paragraph is de- scribed as situational, it means that the characteristic is generally inconsistent with how a client typically and con- sistently behaves when interacting with others. Instead, a situational characteristic reflects a client's acute behavior or reaction to a specific situation. Situational character- istics that interfere with communication or occupational engagement are most likely to reveal themselves when the client is facing a situation where some immediate aspect of the impairment or the environment is experienced as painful, frustrating, or stressful. Impairments, particularly when they are new or when there is a medical crisis or exacerbation in severity that disrupts one's usual routines or relationships, often cause people to experience stress. Therapists are encouraged to assume, on some level, that a client's impairment situation or the client's interaction with an unaccommodating or difficult environment causes the client to be more vulnerable to experiencing a variety of reactions, many of which may be perceived as negative or at least atypical for that individual.
y2qo | PRACTICAL APPLICATION 3.1
1piq | Mr. Johnson (described in Chapter 1 and also featured in the case example earlier in this chapter) offers one example of a person exhibiting several situational interpersonal characteristics. Before his stroke, he was described as an outgoing and sociable person who enjoyed his work and achieved a sense of value from helping family and friends in his spare time. Following his stroke, he exhibited a flat and occasionally angry affect, and his communication style was guarded and reluctant. These interper- sonal characteristics are new and unusual for him and may be attributable to any number of changes that have taken place since the stroke. These might include the neurophysiological effects of the stroke itself, a sense of loss associated with functional decline and impairment, and a sense of lowered self-efficacy or even shame.
7fqw | Feelings of loss are common among newly disabled individuals, and they may manifest in terms of sadness, irritability, anxiety, insecurity, or anger. A health provider's interpersonal behavior, if perceived as insensitive, judg- mental, or uncaring, may also serve as a source of stress and cause the client to interact in a manner that is gener- ally inconsistent with his or her usual way of relating. It is important for new therapists to recognize that these and other acute emotional reactions are normative. In fact, they are "givens" in many health-care situations. They may bear no reflection on the client's character. However, they do have the potential to play out within the therapy relationship, and the way in which a therapist chooses to respond to them is often vital to the future of that relationship (Fig. 3.5).
rhaz | Enduring Interpersonal Characteristics
wak1 | By contrast, enduring characteristics are more stable and consistent aspects of the client's interpersonal behavior. Unlike a situational characteristic, enduring character- istics are not necessarily related to the situation of ac- quiring an impairment, an acute reaction during a brief moment of distress, or to problems in the environment, such as the lack of appropriate accommodations. Instead,

1k9e | PRACTICAL APPLICATION 3.2
5bjs | As explained in Chapter 1, one of Vera's most salient interpersonal characteristics is her high need for control. Vera attempts to direct the therapy session from the moment she meets Erika. She asks Erika numerous questions testing her expertise in the area of cancer and insists on talking about cancer treat- ment and rehabilitation. Moreover, she occasionally confronts Erika when she does not hear an opinion that aligns with her own. A second characteristic is Vera's hyperverbal communication style. This char- acteristic presents itself in Vera's constant talking during her interaction with Erika. A third charac- teristic is Vera's capacity for trust. She is equivocal about Erika's credibility and capacity to serve as her occupational therapist. This drives her to behave in an almost interrogational manner. Although we only have a single interaction during which to ascertain whether these characteristics are situa- tional or enduring, we do know from Chapter 1 that Vera has also been described by her friends as being driven, skeptical, a talker, and strong minded. These characteristics may serve Vera in most contexts, but they have emerged as being problematic for both Vera and Erika during their initial meeting.
uodj | Chapter 3 A Model of the Intentional Relationship 59
k16v | enduring characteristics are more deeply rooted, typically emerge repeatedly through time, and comprise an inter- personal profile that is idiosyncratic to the client.
b2lm | Because they coexist in each client, situational and en- during characteristics are mutually informative. Behavior that reflects one's acute emotional reaction to a stressful event may temporarily attenuate, alter, or intensify one's interpersonal behavior in what are usually more stable categories. For example, a client who normally responds to a challenging situation adaptively may become irritated when the therapist recommends a more challenging ac- tivity if, earlier in that day, the client underwent a pain- ful biopsy and then discovered she did not have enough money to cover the insurance copay fees upon leaving the physician's office. Irrespective of whether an interpersonal characteristic is situational or enduring, characteristics that are more challenging to work with make it difficult for clients to engage in occupations as planned. The ratio- nale for distinguishing the two categories of interpersonal characteristics is to help inform therapists' understand- ing of the client in stressful and nonstressful situations so therapeutic responses can be appropriately tailored and modulated. Both situational and enduring client charac- teristics and how to assess them are described in more detail in Chapter 5.
ti7f | Interpersonal Events of Therapy
oksu | An interpersonal event is a naturally occurring commu- nication, reaction, process, task, or general circumstance that occurs during therapy and that has the potential to detract from or strengthen the therapeutic relation- ship. The therapist's ability to recognize the interper- sonal event when it occurs and respond therapeutically determines
wtow | Whether additional interpersonal events will follow, possibly prompting an interpersonal event cascade
o22k | The effect that the event, and its resolution (or non- resolution), will have on the overall relationship with the client
nwfz | The IRM describes 12 types of interpersonal events that will inevitably occur during therapy, depending on the cli- ent, the therapist, and the therapeutic context. Table 3.2 presents the different event categories (along with exam- ples of what would require the therapist's closer attention).

k0bw | In the case example at the beginning of this chapter, the many nonverbal cues evident during the inter- action between Mr. Johnson and Rigel were significant moments during Mr. Johnson's commu- nication and may be interpreted as interpersonal events. Additionally, when Mr. Johnson mentioned to Rigel that it wasn't his fault that their interaction the day before was not productive, another inter- personal event occurred: an intimate self-disclosure. Mr. Johnson admitted to Rigel that he was respon- sible for the interaction having gone poorly.
