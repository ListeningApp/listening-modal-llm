        "content": "xv78 | Oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses were performed on fourteen samples of monomineralic clays, less than two micrometers, free from iron and manganese oxides as determined by XRD. The analyses were carried out by the Queen's Facility for Isotope Research at Queen's University, Ontario, Canada. Oxygen was extracted from\nsdks | five-milligram samples at five hundred fifty to six hundred degrees Celsius using the bromine pentafluoride technique of Clayton and Mayeda. Samples were analyzed via dual inlet on a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer. For hydrogen isotope measurements, samples were weighed into silver capsules, degassed for one hour at one hundred degrees Celsius, and then crushed and loaded into a zero blank autosampler. Hydrogen isotope compositions were measured using a Finnigan thermos-combustion elemental analyzer coupled to a Thermo-Finnigan DeltaPlus XP continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer. All values are expressed in the conventional delta notation as per mil deviation from Vienna-Standard Mean Ocean Water, with analytical precision and accuracy for eighteen O values of plus-minus zero point one per mil and for D of plus-minus three per mil and plus-minus one point five per mil, respectively.\ny8fb | Sulfur isotope measurements were conducted on fifty-seven handpicked mineral separates, including anhydrite, gypsum, barite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite, at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster, Germany. For thirty-five pure monomineralic samples, the sulfur isotope composition was determined directly without prior chemical treatment, using a Carlo Erba elemental analyzer interfaced to a ThermoFinnigan Delta Plus mass spectrometer. Repeat analyses showed a precision of better than plus-minus zero point three per mil, and standard measurements gave an accuracy of better than plus-minus zero point two per mil. For twenty-two samples of intergrown sulfide-sulfate mineral assemblages, a mineral-specific, wet-chemical pretreatment protocol was applied, yielding four different sulfur phases. Briefly, anhydrite and gypsum were dissolved using a ten percent NaCl solution for twenty-four hours, and dissolved sulfate was precipitated as BaSO4 using standard procedures. BaSOfour precipitates were then converted into silver sulfide using Thode solution, a mixture of hydrogen iodide, hydrochloric acid, and hypophosphorous acid. Sphalerite sulfur was liberated as hydrogen sulfide acid volatile sulfide with hydrochloric acid twenty-five percent for one hour at eighty-five degrees Celsius. Subsequently, disulfides such as chalcopyrite and pyrite were extracted using chromous-chloride solution, chromium-reducible sulfide fraction. Each time, resulting hydrogen sulfide was precipitated first as zinc sulfide using zinc acetate and ultimately as silver sulfide using silver nitrate as described in Canfield et al. and Rice et al.. Following the quantitative removal of all sulfide minerals using acidic hydrochloric acid chromous chloride solution, acid-insoluble sulfate, barite, was liberated as hydrogen sulfide, following Thode and Monster, and ultimately precipitated as silver sulfide. All silver sulfide precipitates, representing water-soluble sulfates such as anhydrite and gypsum, acid-insoluble sulfates such as barite, acid volatile sulfides such as sphalerite, and chromium-reducible sulfides such as chalcopyrite and pyrite, were subjected to fluorination isotope ratio mass spectrometer, following the procedure outlined by Ono et al., using a ThermoScientific Mat two five three mass spectrometer. Results are reported in the standard delta notation as per mil difference relative to Vienna-Canyon Diablo Troilite. Precision and accuracy were better than plus-minus zero point zero three per mil.\n521q | The radium-226 barium dating of hydrothermal barite from twenty-three sulfide-sulfate samples was carried out following the methods of Jamieson et al., modified after Ditchburn et al.. Samples were crushed and powdered, with one split used to\nyogo | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA SEAFLOOR MASSIVE SULFIDE DEPOSIT\n2285 | determine barium concentrations by instrumental neutron activation analysis and another split used to determine radium-226 activity via gamma spectrometry at the Elemental Tracer Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. The daughter product of radium-226 is radon-222, with a half-life of three point eight days. A daughter isotope from the decay of radon-222, lead-214, was measured as a proxy to avoid peak overlap with uranium-235. Prior to measurements, the sample tubes were sealed for twenty-one days to prevent the escape of radon-222 gas and obtain secular equilibrium between radium-226 and lead-214. Measurements were made using an XLB GWL SV digital gamma spectrometer, containing a high-purity germanium crystal, fifty-four point seven by sixty-six point two millimeters, with an active well depth of forty millimeters. Counting times ranged from two to twelve hours, depending on the activity of radium-226 in each sample. Spectral signatures were calibrated using IAEA three one two reference material and analyzed using a custom program developed and provided by Peter Appleby to correct for background, detector efficiency, sample volumes, and matrix effects. Ages were determined relative to a zero-age end member selected from one of the actively venting chimneys and assumed to represent the initial radium-226 barium ratio, one thousand twenty-two plus-minus sixty-eight becquerels per kilogram wet percent; sample GMA one three dash zero two four. All ages are considered minimum values, as incorporation of young barite in the samples cannot be ruled out.\nys0g | Drill Sites\n7zvp | Shallow seafloor drilling was focused along the main north-south trending fissure, sites A through E, targeting areas with accumulations of chimneys and mounds and spatially associated with buried circular structures that may be manifestations of the cinder cones, with an additional site to the west of this structure, site F. Three subseafloor rock types were encountered in most drill holes, in order of increasing depth: unconsolidated volcaniclastic sediment cover sequence, mineralized intervals consisting of mixed chimney talus, and intensely clay altered volcaniclastic material footwall sequence. In addition, several drill holes intersected intervals of oxidized ferruginous mud associated with rounded to subrounded chimney fragments, interpreted to be paleoseafloor horizons.\nww6u | Site A",
