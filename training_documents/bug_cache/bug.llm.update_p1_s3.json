        "content": "sb1e | Predicting Voice Behavior in Work Groups\nw2yn | This field study of four hundred forty-one full-time employees in ninety-five work groups examined voice behavior (constructive challenge to the status quo with the intent of improving the situation rather than merely criticizing) as a function of person-centered (satisfaction with the work group, global self-esteem) and situational factors (group size, self-managed versus traditional style of management). Using a measure of voice with demonstrated construct validity, the study showed that these person and situation factors explained ten percent of the variance in peer-rated voice assessed six months later. Significant Person X Situation interactions suggested that individuals with low global self-esteem or high satisfaction with their group were more responsive to the situational factors than individuals with high global self-esteem or low satisfaction. The authors discuss the importance of including person-centered characteristics, situational factors, and their interactions as predictors of voice.\nap6l | For over fifty years, scholars have recognized the importance of behavior that goes beyond normal role expectations or job requirements and that benefits or is intended to benefit the organization. Over the last decade research interest in these discretionary or extra-role behaviors has increased; however, the primary focus has been on affiliative behaviors (e.g., helping) associated with \"organizational citizenship\" and \"contextual performance.\" Although this research has led to a great deal of insight, other types of extra-role behavior have received far less attention. In this study we focused on voice behavior-speaking out and challenging the status quo with the intent of improving the situation. Although scholars have acknowledged the contributions that voice and change-oriented behavior can make to organizational effectiveness, voice is particularly important today given the emphasis on flexibility, innovation, and continuous improvement.\niest | Nowhere is the need for voice more important than in work groups. Work groups, or sets of interdependent\ncox8 | individuals who share responsibility for outcomes, are increasingly being used as a means of dealing with competitive environments that demand flexibility. Instead of structuring work around individual-level jobs, work is assigned to groups that are expected to devise effective means for accomplishing the work. In such situations, group members must share ideas, knowledge, and insights so that multiple viewpoints are considered in making decisions.\nppqi | Over the past thirty years, researchers have spent a great deal of effort describing problems that occur when group members fail to speak out and share their ideas with each other. This research focused on the outcome side of the voice nomological network (i.e., problems when people do not engage in voice). In contrast, less research has focused on antecedents of voice. Furthermore, research on antecedents of voice is still in an early stage of development and has explained only a small amount of variance. This is a problem because without knowledge of antecedents, researchers cannot make recommendations regarding how to manage voice in work groups. Given that organizations are increasingly dependent on their groups' success, it is critical for researchers to begin to fill this void. The purpose of this article and the study it reports, therefore, is to propose and assess a predictive model of voice that considers several antecedents. Before we can begin, however, we need to explain more precisely what we mean by voice.\noxou | Voice Research\n495n | Van Dyne et al. reviewed the literature on extra-role behavior and proposed a two-dimensional typology and nomological network. On one dimension, their typology contrasts promotive and prohibitive behavior (encouraging something to happen versus encouraging something to cease). On the other dimension, their typology contrasts affiliative and challenging behavior (interpersonal behavior that promotes cooperation and strengthens relationships versus change-oriented behavior that focuses on ideas and issues). Using this typology, Van Dyne and her colleagues distinguished between several forms of extra-role behavior.\nawri | Voice, defined as nonrequired behavior that emphasizes expression of constructive challenge with an intent to improve rather than merely criticize, falls clearly in the promotive-challenging cell of the Van Dyne et al. typology. Voice is distinct from affiliative behavior (e.g., helping) normally associated with organizational citizenship or contextual performance because affiliative behavior (e.g., helping) is meant to preserve or improve relationships, whereas voice is challenging and may upset interpersonal relationships. Voice is also distinct from prohibitive behaviors such as whistle-blowing. Whistle-blowing is critical and meant to stop some activity as opposed to being constructive and meant to change (improve) some activity.\nbl28 | From a theoretical and definitional perspective, given the definition of voice above, it is possible to further distinguish voice from other related behaviors. For example, we do not consider principled organizational dissent to be voice because principled organizational dissent focuses on objections based on conscientious or moral principles rather than suggesting more effective ways of doing things. Voice behavior is also distinct from complaining. Complaints reflect expression of dissatisfaction and do not necessarily include suggestions for change. Because we define voice as a behavior, our use of the term does not refer to the availability of grievance procedures or perceptions of access to grievance procedures. Finally, voice is distinct from normal role or in-role behavior when the expression of constructive challenge is not specified in formal job requirements or descriptions. That is, constructive suggestions made by consultants or other change agents in the context of their job requirements are not voice as defined here. One example of voice as we define it is when a group member makes an innovative suggestion for change to a standard operating procedure in order to improve\nd5bz | work flow, even when such a suggestion might upset others.",
