        "content": "htre | Bulk compositions of the seafloor chimneys and mineralized volcanic breccias are listed in Table one. The seafloor chimneys\nda3c | contain abundant zinc up to fifty-two point sixty weight percent (average nineteen point twenty weight percent; N equals thirty-six) and copper up to thirty point zero zero weight percent (average five point eighty-two weight percent; N equals thirty-six) but generally low lead (less than zero point zero one to two point ninety-three weight percent lead; average zero point thirty-five weight percent; N equals thirty-six) compared to other modern back-arc basin sulfide deposits. Calcium concentrations are low in the chimneys (average zero point zero six weight percent; N equals thirty-six), but barium (average six point forty-nine weight percent; N equals thirty-six) and strontium (average two thousand one hundred fifty-seven parts per million; N equals thirty-six; up to zero point eighty-five weight percent in barite-rich samples) are high. The silicon dioxide contents average eleven point sixty-seven weight percent (N equals thirty-six), but one chimney contains seventy-five point zero nine weight percent silicon dioxide together with one point seventy-five weight percent barium. The copper-rich chimneys have high molybdenum (average three hundred forty-three parts per million; N equals two) and indium (average two hundred sixty-two parts per million; N equals two), with high gold (nine thousand two hundred sixty parts per billion) present in one sample. The zinc-rich samples contain very high gallium (up to one thousand five hundred forty parts per million), germanium (up to ninety-nine parts per million), mercury (up to ninety-five parts per million), and selenium (up to twenty parts per million). Concentrations of silver, antimony, arsenic, and gold are also higher than in the copper-rich chimneys, although high arsenic is found in both zinc- and copper-rich samples. Mercury concentrations are especially high in samples containing marcasite and late sphalerite plus galena. The four sampled barite-rich chimneys also have high lead (average seven thousand seventy-three parts per million), arsenic (average two hundred ninety-nine parts per million), antimony (average eighty-two parts per million), gold (average two thousand thirty-eight parts per billion), and silver (average one hundred twenty-one parts per million). Statistical correlations between the different trace elements clearly reflect the higher (greater than two hundred fifty degrees Celsius) and lower temperatures (less than two hundred fifty degrees Celsius) of the copper-rich and zinc-rich assemblages, respectively, as well as various lattice substitutions in the corresponding minerals (e.g., cadmium in sphalerite, strontium in barite, arsenic and antimony in lead-rich sulfosalts, etc.). Gallium is incorporated mainly in galena in low-temperature assemblages, whereas in higher-temperature assemblages it mainly resides in sphalerite with moderate to high iron contents. Arsenic is high in low-temperature assemblages, reflecting the presence of arsenic in low-temperature minerals such as galena and sulfosalts. In a single sample containing secondary bornite (chalcopyrite-rich chimney GMA thirteen dash zero ten), silver concentrations are one thousand two hundred fifty-three parts per million. Contents of cobalt, nickel, tin, tungsten, bismuth, and tellurium are generally below detection limits in all samples, unlike other arc-related hydrothermal systems that commonly contain discrete bismuth and tellurium minerals.\n890q | Subseafloor mineralization consists of (one) unconsolidated and locally hydrothermally cemented chimney talus, (two) chimney talus, mixed with altered volcanic clasts, that is generally hydrothermally cemented, (three) chimney talus associated with oxidized intervals , (four) disseminated to patchy sulfides (chalcopyrite, pyrite, sphalerite) within altered volcaniclastic rocks, and (five) sulfide minerals associated with late sulfate veins that extend to maximum depths of approximately twenty-one meters below sea level. Drilling shows that the majority of the mineralization at Tinakula comprises chimney talus that occurs directly beneath the unconsolidated volcaniclastic material (generally between zero point six and five point three meters below sea floor). The oxidized intervals contain variable amounts of sulfide material (mostly chimney talus). Disseminated and vein-controlled sulfide (pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) occur in the upper approximately zero point five to two point six meters of most drill holes. Seven samples of mineralized volcanic breccia down to five point eight meters below sea floor contain mostly pyrite (nine point seven to thirty point one weight percent sulfide sulfur) with minor anhydrite accounting for approximately zero point one to zero point five weight percent sulfate sulfur. Taking into account the dilution from wall rock, mineralized portions of the\njomo | MINERALIZATION AND ALTERATION OF THE TINAKULA S M S DEPOSIT\n06fi | samples contain slightly higher cobalt and selenium and lower cadmium, mercury, antimony, and silver than the seafloor chimneys, consistent with higher temperatures of mineralization.\nhb4s | Buried sulfide mineralization is estimated to have an area at least three times larger than that of the seafloor chimneys and mounds, although more drilling is required to establish the full extent and continuity.\ncqq2 | The chimney talus and oxidized intervals appear continuous between drill holes at sites A, B, and D, but mineralization was not encountered in the two drill holes at site C. Since the drill platform required relatively flat slopes, drilling at this site was limited to the areas beside the known chimney mounds. Therefore, the occurrence of chimney talus below the mounds was not confirmed at the location. The\n1ews | Subseafloor Alteration\nafyn | Below the mineralized interval, the volcaniclastic breccias have been intensely hydrothermally altered, with clay minerals occurring as replacements of volcanic material and infills of pore spaces.
