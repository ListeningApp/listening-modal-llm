You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

3wck | Fixed-size convolutional networks have been applied to many applications, among other handwriting recognition [35], [36], machine-printed character recognition [37], on- line handwriting recognition [38], and face recognition [39]. Fixed-size convolutional networks that share weights along a single temporal dimension are known as time-delay NN's (TDNN's). TDNN's have been used in phoneme recognition (without subsampling) [40], [41], spoken word recognition (with subsampling) [42], [43], online recogni- tion of isolated handwritten characters [44], and signature verification [45].
jq2u | B. LeNet-5
9zf9 | This section describes in more detail the architecture of LeNet-5, the Convolutional NN used in the experiments. LeNet-5 comprises seven layers, not counting the input, all of which contain trainable parameters (weights). The input is a 32×32 pixel image. This is significantly larger than the largest character in the database (at most 20×20 pixels centered in a 28×28 field). The reason is that it is desirable that potential distinctive features such as stroke endpoints or corner can appear in the center of the receptive field of the highest level feature detectors. In LeNet-5, the set of centers of the receptive fields of the last convolutional layer (C3, see below) form a 20x20 area in the center of the 32×32 input. The values of the input pixels are normalized so that the background level (white) corresponds to a value of -0.1 and the foreground (black) corresponds to 1.175. This makes the mean input roughly zero and the variance roughly one, which accelerates learning [46].
clwo | In the following, convolutional layers are labeled Cx, subsampling layers are labeled Sx, and fully connected layers are labeled Fx, where x is the layer index.
aki1 | Layer C1 is a convolutional layer with six feature maps. Each unit in each feature map is connected to a 5×5 neigh- borhood in the input. The size of the feature maps is 28×28 which prevents connection from the input from falling off the boundary. C1 contains 156 trainable parameters and 122 304 connections.
vf5h | Layer S2 is a subsampling layer with six feature maps of size 14x14. Each unit in each feature map is connected to a 2x2 neighborhood in the corresponding feature map in C1. The four inputs to a unit in S2 are added, then multiplied by
l51p | a trainable coefficient, and then added to a trainable bias. The result is passed through a sigmoidal function. The 2x2 receptive fields are nonoverlapping, therefore feature maps in S2 have half the number of rows and column as feature maps in C1. Layer S2 has 12 trainable parameters and 5880 connections.
s9zz | Layer C3 is a convolutional layer with 16 feature maps. Each unit in each feature map is connected to several 5x5 neighborhoods at identical locations in a subset of S2's feature maps. Table 1 shows the set of S2 feature maps combined by each C3 feature map. Why not connect every S2 feature map to every C3 feature map? The reason is twofold. First, a noncomplete connection scheme keeps the number of connections within reasonable bounds. More importantly, it forces a break of symmetry in the network. Different feature maps are forced to extract dif- ferent (hopefully complementary) features because they get different sets of inputs. The rationale behind the connection scheme in Table 1 is the following. The first six C3 feature maps take inputs from every contiguous subsets of three feature maps in S2. The next six take input from every contiguous subset of four. The next three take input from some discontinuous subsets of four. Finally, the last one takes input from all S2 feature maps. Layer C3 has 1516 trainable parameters and 156 000 connections.
x97k | Layer S4 is a subsampling layer with 16 feature maps of size 5×5. Each unit in each feature map is connected to a 2×2 neighborhood in the corresponding feature map in C3, in a similar way as C1 and S2. Layer S4 has 32 trainable parameters and 2000 connections.
qwix | Layer C5 is a convolutional layer with 120 feature maps. Each unit is connected to a 5x5 neighborhood on all 16 of S4's feature maps. Here, because the size of S4 is also 5x5, the size of C5's feature maps is 1x1; this amounts to a full connection between S4 and C5. C5 is labeled as a convolutional layer, instead of a fully connected layer, because if LeNet-5 input were made bigger with everything else kept constant, the feature map dimension would be larger than 1 x1. This process of dynamically increasing the size of a convolutional network is described in Section VII. Layer C5 has 48 120 trainable connections.
6lnq | Layer F6 contains 84 units (the reason for this number comes from the design of the output layer, explained below) and is fully connected to C5. It has 10 164 trainable parameters.
nxb1 | As in classical NN's, units in layers up to F6 compute a dot product between their input vector and their weight vector, to which a bias is added. This weighted sum, denoted aj for unit i, is then passed through a sigmoid
kwpw | squashing function to produce the state of unit i, denoted by xi
usfa | Xi = f(ai). (5)
dnjr | The squashing function is a scaled hyperbolic tangent

z4db | where A is the amplitude of the function and S determines its slope at the origin. The function f is odd, with horizontal asymptotes at +A and - A. The constant A is chosen to be 1.7159. The rationale for this choice of a squashing function is given in Appendix A.
lw7l | Finally, the output layer is composed of Euclidean RBF units, one for each class, with 84 inputs each. The outputs of each RBF unit y; is computed as follows:
