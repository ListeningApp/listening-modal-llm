You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7h0h | The figures provided by Willoughby, which were based on the information from the interrogated Chinese POWs, systematically decreased the size of the opposing force. This was accomplished by a selective use of the available data. On October 29, for example, many reports based on POW interrogations indicated that a massive PLA crossing of the Yalu had taken place. Nevertheless, Willoughby's assessment cited only one report and estimated that "only token forces from the Fortieth Army Headquarters and from each of its divisions entered Korea on 20 October."> Later, 4 while admitting that elements of four Chinese armies were in Korea, he counted the specific units of the captured soldiers but not their parent units. Thus, when visiting the X Corps in November he estimated that "probably only a battalion of volunteers of each division identified was actually in Korea."146 Justin Haynes rightly concluded: "Due to this method of analysis Willoughby accounted for only one third of Chinese Communist troops inside North Korea at that time."14 In fact, on the eve of the Second CPVF Campaign, Willoughby accounted for less than a fifth of the Chinese power. 148
a64c | In order to prevent challenges to his estimates Willoughby, strove to monopolize the estimates of the CPVF OB. Upon learning that CIA officers were participating in the interrogations of the Chinese POWs and reporting their findings to Washington, he began denying them access to the captured CPVF soldiers."4" <LATEX>H e</LATEX> also threatened to close down a CIA shop in Tokyo after learning that it had reported, based on information from Taiwanese intelligence, that the Chinese army had crossed the Yalu.15 As a result, the CIA estimates of the Chinese threat had to rely onWilloughby's reports. The same was true with the Joint Chiefs of Staff: 90 percent of their intelligence was based on Willoughby's reports.151 Consequently, the Far East Command evaluation of Chinese intervention capabilities and intentions "seem to have been the determining factor in shaping the future course of U.N. military action" in the war.152
gi7n | Following the end of the first Chinese campaign, the JCS considered three possible courses of action: hold the present line; resume the advancement to the Yalu; or withdraw to a better line of defense. In light of the lack of 4 clarity about the extent of Chinese threat, the JCS preferred the first option. Attempting to occupy the rest of North Korea was considered too risky and withdrawal was deemed morally and politically problematic.153 155 Nonetheless, under pressure from MacArthur and the JCS concern about an emerging State Department plan to create a buffer zone along the Yalu, the JCS gave the general reluctant approval to resume the offensive. Willoughby's underestimation of the Chinese force in Korea, as well as his assessment that the weakened CPVF was withdrawing northward, which was based on a Chinese deception to lure MacArthur to resume his offensive, significantly influenced this decision. Obviously, the prize of ending the war by Christmas outweighed a more cautious policy.154
3pn1 | On the eve of the "home-by-Christmas offensive," the Eighth Army held 96 POWs, who testified that six Chinese armies (18 divisions) were in Korea. A day later, when the Eighth Army started its advancement, FEC G-2 provided its estimation of the enemy forces-82,799 North Korean and from 40,000 to 70,935 Chinese soldiers. Willoughby also assessed that the Chinese forces lacked ammunition reserves and stated, "Constant United Nations pressure along the entire line during the past few weeks should make it perfectly clear to the Reds that this drain on fire power is certainly not apt to be decreased but increased."15 <LATEX>1 5 5</LATEX> This optimism proved to be completely wrong. The Chinese were aware that the Americans underestimated their capabilities and intentions and planned to use this to achieve another surprise. By this stage, they had accumulated 380,000 soldiers in Korea (309,065 more than Willoughby's precise estimate indicated) and prepared for a counterattack.156 4
wjuz | The systematic underestimation of the magnitude of the Chinese forces in Korea had a dramatic impact on the way the war developed. At the strategic level, the failure to realize that Beijing had already committed significant forces to Korea led to the mistaken conclusion that the relatively small number of Chinese forces in Korea was merely a means to save face after the public intervention threats. Hence, giving MacArthur the green light to renew the offensive was not seen as too risky. As the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. J. Lawton Collins, concluded, an American offensive "might well provide an out for the Chinese Communists to withdraw into Manchuria without loss of face." At the operational level, Willoughby's assessment that most of the Chinese army had not crossed the Yalu but remained in Manchuria made the option of reaching the Yalu more feasible and less perilous. The commanders of both the Eighth Army and the X Corps estimated that the enemy forces they were to confront "would fight only a delaying defensive action."158 This had a devastating effect on force deployment when the UN offensive was launched. In the case of the X Corps, for example, it "led to an ill-advised thinning out of American forces" when they started their offensive on November 27.15" And at the tactical level, Willoughby's gross underestimation of the magnitude of the Chinese threat left the forces at the front completely unaware of the enemy who confronted them, and completely unprepared when the full blow fell on them.
3yxv | On November 25, a day after the beginning of MacArthur's offensive into what Halberstam defined as "the largest ambush in the era of modern warfare,"16 the Chinese counteroffensive was launched. It lasted until December 24 and delivered the United States one of the greatest defeats in its history. Under difficult weather conditions, and against a highly capable enemy, the surprised Eighth Army and X Corps had to withdraw to south of the 38th parallel. According to Chinese accounts, by the end of the Second Campaign, the UN losses amounted to 36,000 casualties and POWs, of which 24,000 were Americans. The CPV losses were 30,700. The war turned into a Chinese-US confrontation, and instead of ending in 1950, it lasted for another two-and-a-half years and took the lives of many more.
d8zj | p. 159 c. Explaining the intelligence failure
ywxn | A gross intelligence failure following an earlier one is the exception rather than the rule, as demonstrated by the other two dyads in this study. Our hypothesis has been that a second failure in a row will not result from insufficient information about the looming threat but, at least partially, emerge as the product of ineffective learning process after the first fiasco on the part of critical decision-makers. The American failure of November 1950 supports this hypothesis.
uxhs | Broadly speaking, the fundamental sin of the American estimation process, especially in the FEC, was that of hubris. MacArthur's successful landing in Inchon and the fast collapse of the KPA eroded the impact of the more painful events of the war's first months. This success, moreover, increased the American belief in its military superiority against any Asian opponent, and nurtured the cult of MacArthur's omnipotent leadership.
