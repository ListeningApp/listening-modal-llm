You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

77kg | In the following example, we added the group to the Color shelf on the Marks card of the map. Countries are colored by their membership in the group. Either they are in, or they are out, as shown in the following screenshot:
tiim | Similarly, we can create a set that groups members of a dimension by their adherence to the criteria that you establish.
3bcu | We can create a set that identifies the top 25 countries by life expectancy, which will be used again to modify the map, from the World Bank indicators data source by performing the following steps:
x18v | 1. Right-click on the Country field in the Dimensions pane.
ymma | 2. Click on Create and then select Set.
9sdd | 3. Rename the Set to Country Set.
fvzf | 4. Click on the Condition tab rather than manually selecting the members of the Set so that it will be updated if and when we get new data.

vmox | Chapter 4
7w5a | Summary
ts5q | In this chapter, we discussed the processes that are the best if you want to design charts, from understanding the requirements, to data discovery, through to an iterative discovery cycle. We discussed the best practices in chart design and data visualization, reviewed the chart types that best answer which types of questions, and explored data dimensions and measures. We also discussed the different impacts that discrete and continuous data elements have on visualizations. Lastly, we talked about the use of reference and trend lines in views.
10rn | In the next chapter, we will talk about how to create calculated fields and table calculations.
eos5 | Calculations
0kcg | The data sources that you query to tell stories do not always have all the data points that you need. If they did, someone else would have told the story already. Tableau Public's data engine allows you to create new mathematical calculations of varying complexity, from basic multiplication functions to sophisticated aggregations with specific levels of detail that add color, context, and key insights to your data stories.
1f32 | In this chapter, we will discuss how to develop new insights for users by understanding and implementing different types of calculated fields. We will use several data sources that we have connected to previously, in order to help you understand the following functions:
glqs | · Creating and editing calculated fields
1ded | · Types of calculations
zod3 | · Number functions
e33h | · String functions
vnl2 | · Date functions
kjun | · Type conversions
u0y7 | · Aggregate functions
bs86 | · Logic functions
sglt | · Blending data sources
0l33 | Throughout this chapter, we will present and discuss error messages that you are likely to encounter. We cannot emphasize enough that, especially when presenting information to others using a tool that might be new to them, substance is more important than style. Also, it's very difficult to rebuild credibility once it's been compromised.
8wt8 | The next chapter focuses on Level of Detail calculations and table calculations. They both are big topics that build on the capabilities that you will learn in this chapter.
5fo9 | In this chapter, we will use a data set of major global floods since 1985, which was found on Tableau Public's resources page. The original source is at http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/index.html.
djty | Creating calculated fields
sm6g | A calculated field that you create exists only in your data source in Tableau Public; it does not exist in the file that you originally queried, which is the reason behind why you are creating it in the first place. In the following examples, we will be creating calculated fields in a data set of floods. The fields that we create will show up in the Dimensions or Measures pane in the Data window in Tableau Public depending on their type of field, with the equals sign (=) next to them.
ib71 | In Tableau Public, there are several ways to create a calculated field. The following steps will guide you:
jmui | 1. From the Analysis menu, select Create Calculated Field.
3ygl | 2. Click on the Context menu of the data source and then select Create Calculated Field.
fic6 | 3. Right-click on a field in the Dimensions or Measure pane of a data source. Select Create and then choose Calculated Field.
p33e | Tableau Public has a new calculated field dialog box in version 9.x, which is a significant improvement over the previous versions. When it's open, you can perform functions on your visualization, and if you want to add fields to a calculation, you can drag them into the dialog box from the Data window.
4c71 | You also can resize the dialog box and show or hide the list of functions.
8yig | The following screenshot shows the dialog box along with descriptions of each fields:
21te | Chapter 5
hqh4 | The following are the descriptions of all the functions shown in the preceding screenshot:
5lyh | · Calculated field name (1): This is where you give the field a good, descriptive name so that others understand what it is.
y1fi | . Data source (2): The data source name in which you created the calculated field.
c78q | . Click on the close icon (3) to close the dialog box.
yzd8 | · The list of functions (4) includes the following function types and elements:
icj7 | ° List of function types, which can be used to filter the list of functions. The options, which will be explored in detail later in this chapter, are as follows:
9qmz | · String
0i7o | · Date
gi46 | . Type Conversion
wgh3 | · Logical
07sg | · Aggregate
fpt9 | · User
w88n | · Table calculation
msxj | . Filter box (here, you can type in the name of the function type that you would like to see)
o5k9 | . Information box (5): Here, you can see the name of the function, what it does, and an example.
ck36 | . Button (6): This can be used to hide the function list.
d6w7 | . The Apply and OK buttons (7): These buttons apply changes that you have made to the visualization and then close the window respectively.
7y7b | · Messages (8): This tells you when your calculation is valid, when there are errors, and what the error is.
bb5t | . The calculation itself (9): Tableau Public 9.x is intelligent. When you start typing in a field name, it will suggest all the fields that include the string that you are typing. You can hit the Tab key or click on its suggestion to populate the field. Alternatively, you can drag fields from the Dimensions and Measures pane, of both your current data source and others data sources that you have loaded into your workbook, to create new fields.
ehcp | The parts of the formula include fields, mathematical operators, functions, and often parameters as shown in the following screenshot:
htk2 | Editing calculated fields
uttq | Once you have created a calculated field that is valid, you can edit it by right-clicking on it in the window in which it appears and then selecting Edit. You can also rename calculated fields (as well as fields native to your data source) by right-clicking on them and selecting Rename.
hbpe | Types of calculations
ag8f | There are several types of calculations that you can create, as listed previously. Some of them are common to other data management tools, but some, such as user calculations, are unique to Tableau Public.
syhi | When creating calculated fields, the functions that you can apply on a field depends on the type of that field. For instance, you can't perform multiplication functions on a string field (even if it contains only numbers) without first converting it to a numeric field. Similarly, you can't concatenate numeric values without first converting them to strings.
0l9v | Basic mathematical functions, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponents (^), are created by typing the standard operators into the dialog box.
bbwp | You can add functions by typing their names or filtering the list of functions to the appropriate group, or name, and then double-clicking on the best choice. The different types of functions that you can perform in Tableau Public are as follows:
d687 | · Number: This includes geometric, trigonometric, and rounding functions, among others
