You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

5esx | Third Wave
m5ka | The third wave of HCI begins to grapple with life outside of professional and organizational work contexts. Moving beyond the workplace and productivity, computing takes on numerous varied roles: leisure [14,15], socializing [60,61], gaming and sport [3,26], sensing and expressing emotion [12,79], cultural production and meaning making [46,86], etc. As computing moved "off the desktop" [87] into smartphones, mp3 players, cars, tablets, etc., it moved into myriad other facets of our lives. These developments constitute HCI in yet another way:
byu8 | 1. A human is a person engaging in (a set of) socio- cultural practices embedded within a numerous broader contexts, including cultural, historical, political, organizational, etc. [52]
76b0 | 2. A computer is a technological system that may consist of a single device, a constellation of devices, an infrastructure, or a more complex assemblage that arises from and is embedded within a particular set of contexts.
zxz6 | 3. An interaction is the experience [31,91] of leveraging a technological system in the course of an individually, socially, or culturally meaningful practice.
xnth | Ultimately, the model is of a human using technology to engage in socio-culturally situated practices.
vafm | Thus, the third wave user becomes a person using technology to engage in socio-culturally situated practices (commerce, leisure, artistic performance, sport, etc.). Work along these lines includes situations involving one user and
2zmw | Interactive Design Methodologies
bf9k | one device (e.g., me and my smartphone), multiple users at one device (e.g., large shared displays), one user with multiple devices (e.g., how I manage data across my smartphone, tablet, laptop, and server), and multiple users with multiple devices (e.g., almost any kind of ubicomp system). In each of these configurations, the user remains paramount. This focus can be seen, for instance, in the emphasis on user experience, or in BÃ¸dker's interest in "the work that the human user does to make multiple objects and mediators work together" [11:3].
otkr | How the Ideology of the User Empowers and Constrains
ibgs | The comparison of the three waves of HCI in the previous section shows important differences and striking commonalities. Despite shifts in the disciplinary traditions invoked, in the methods applied, and in the technologies of interest, we see continued ideological focus on the user. While the scope expands-to include organizational context in second wave and sociocultural context in third wave- the analytic focus remains the user. Technology wants users, and HCI wants to see people as users.
colo | The ideology of the user does not refer to an imperialist urge to encourage all persons everywhere to adopt a given technology (although this is a dominant trend in HCI [76]). Rather, it is the requirement that, if we want to talk about a person meaningfully within HCI, we need to be able to talk about them as a user.
d6r4 | An Example
9mrz | For instance, consider photo-sharing on social media. Third wave work would certainly acknowledge the cultural embeddedness of this activity. A given design may allow a photographer to capture and/or express elements of the experience in which the photos were taken [58,88]. And what of the person who appears in the photo? S/he can comment on the photo, tag or untag her/his likeness in the photo, request to have the photo taken down, post her/his own photos in response, or engage in other socioculturally meaningful practices. All this functionality, though, becomes unavailable if the person in the photograph does not have (or wish to create) an account. In other words, for the design to account for the person who appears in the photo, s/he must be treated as a user. Similar examples can be found in second wave HCI, e.g., group calendaring succeeding by first giving each member of the group an individual motivation to become a user [41,43]. This tendency to user-ify is quite understandable. In some ways, "user" is the most (or perhaps even the only) meaningful way we have of talking about or accounting for the human(s) in human-computer interaction. If someone is not a user, why would we be talking about them, let alone designing for them?
pk06 | Empowerment
7wn9 | The structure of the user provides important value within HCI discourse and practice. The user not only gives us a vocabulary for talking about the human elements of computing, but it also enables us to account for them in
wcd0 | CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA
caos | design. Numerous central concepts within the field-user studies, user-centered design, user experience-are made possible via the rhetorical construct of the user. Furthermore, thinking about users not in the abstract but as specific individual people can allow designers to move from generalities to specificities, i.e., it can facilitate the incorporation of human elements into computing design. Moreover, this impetus to user-ify resonates with our goals of empowerment; if "HCI tools and methods can be used to help the under-served, under-resourced, and under- represented," we can accomplish #chi4good1.
qrvy | Constraints
pn9j | However, while the ideology of the user enables and empowers, it simultaneously limits and constrains. By providing focus and clarity with respect to users, a myopic fixation on the user limits our ability to see other configurations of interaction with computers, particularly in relationships that sit outside the bounds of what we would likely refer to as "use" [e.g., 8].
1pmc | The constraints imposed by the ideology of the user are enacted via multiple means. One of the most foundational questions in user-centered design, "Who are your users?" suggests that users are the (only) people in which you might be interested. To give someone meaningfully important consideration in HCI, they must first be user-ified, regardless of the appropriateness of that appellation. Documentation can enact similar constraints, providing a sort of technological paratext that prescribes the particular relationships that one can have (as well as those relationships one should have and should not have) with a computer [90]. Even physical computing hardware can be designed to invite, to discourage, or to prevent entirely alternative uses not envisioned by a designer [90].
5z6q | These constraints can be overcome. Emerging threads of research and design (described further below) embody a kind of post-userism that moves beyond the ideology of the user. Nonetheless, as argued above, much of the scholarship and virtually all of the design within HCI provide limited conceptual grounding to help us account for (rather than subsume, condescend, or dismiss) relationships outside the purview of the user.
yeoh | LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION
b8hf | Where is a user? Put another way, where and how are the different definitions of human, computer, and interaction we described above codified and enacted? To answer this question, we must attend to how various subject positions are defined and represented relative to and within technology. We approach this representation ecologically to connote both enumerating the subject positions involved and describing the relationships among them. We argue that representations of technological subjects can be grouped into four levels [cf. 30]:
hntf | 6294
99fo | Interactive Design Methodologies
y5r7 | The Systems Level. These representations are codified in the technical workings of a system. How do the low-level variables, data structures, database schema, etc., represent the entities, relationships, and interactions of interest? We use the systems level to talk about the types of representations that lie beyond interaction but that still shape those interactions. Arguably, gradations exist within systems representations. For instance, there may be differences between bits shifting in processor registers and the relationships among columns in database tables. These various systems representations, though, are all conceptually distinct from other levels of representation. Of particular interest to HCI, and the examples that follow, are systems approaches that represent the user-e.g., authentication, user account, user data-and as a result influence possible subject positions.
lrry | The Interface Level. These representations deal with what the user(s) see and interact with. What kinds of entities, and relationships among them, are represented to user(s), and in what ways? The interface is still a part of the technical system, however, as argued further below, we should distinguish between the internal representations maintained by a computational system and the presentation of those representations to user(s).
hvhm | The Design Process Level. These representations allow designers to account for user(s) or others during the design process. Who and what is represented during the design process, and in what ways? Design process representations may involve crafting personas, writing scenarios, accounting for stakeholders, etc. These may or may not translate into explicit representations at the interface or systems levels. However, the design process is often where experiences are typified, influencing system and interface representations through design requirements.
863b | The Ideological Level. These representations function at the level of discourse within a discipline or field of study. How do we account for the various entities and relationships involved in interactions between humans and computers? Ideological representations are most common in work that discusses users-their needs, qualities, and experiences. Ideological representations are subtle: they occur when we use the term "user" to aggregate representations from the three previous levels, collapsing systems, interface, design, and lived experience. Reflexive scholarship in HCI sometimes explicitly focuses on these representations, such as the pivotal pieces across the three waves of HCI. These representations sometimes become most visible in how we narrate the work we do, both to ourselves and to others outside the field. The most common ideological representation in HCI can be seen when we equate "person" with "user."
fj24 | Across these levels, the "post" of post-userism highlights the goal of representing, accounting for, and designing for subject positions other than that of the classical user. In this way, we eschew a fully post-structuralist approach, which
uz3c | CHI 2017, May 6-11, 2017, Denver, CO, USA
d5bi | would dissolve or transcend categorical boundaries entirely. We also eschew a fully post-humanist approach, which would place something other than a human being (a relationship, a non-human entity, an organization, an event, etc.) at the center of design. Essentially, such approaches would identify and attempt to transcend the limits of subjectivity as a design construct. While interesting and important possibilities, this paper focuses instead on the representation of subject positions across the four levels described above.
ba4l | At the ideological level, HCI has a fairly well-developed body of work accounting for post-user subject positions [6,9,52,76]. However, those developments have not been manifest to the same degree at other levels. This paper addresses how we might go about incorporating post- userism into the design process, interface, and systems representations.
ffx8 | SCENARIOS AND STRATEGIES: POST-USERISM IN PRACTICE
s6su | At this point, we can return to the definitional question: What is post-userism? How might you know when you have a situation that could benefit from a post-user lens? Post-userism involves attending to representations of the ecologies of subject positions that people might occupy with respect to technology. Researchers, designers, systems architects, etc. could benefit from post-userism when they encounter breakdowns across the four levels of representation described above. As a practical strategy, post-userism does not necessarily help solve existing problems. Rather, it enables more comprehensive problem setting or problem framing [28,77,78], facilitating a design scope that encompasses greater varieties of human- computer interactions.
y219 | Here we describe instances of post-userism and what post- userism looks like in practice. To do so, this section works through a series of scenarios where we see post-userism, outlining strategies for applying a post-user lens in each. The strategies synthesize across examples, demonstrating the process of identifying how the user gets variously deployed across different levels of representation. These strategies both help define the ecology of subject positions one might want to consider and provide some guidance as to what you might do about it. As described further below, we hope this series of strategies provides a foundation upon which future work can build.
06ht | As such, this section presents a non-exhaustive typology. We neither attempt, nor are we able, to articulate and provide strategies for every situation in which the ideology of the user breakdown across levels of representation. Furthermore, not all such breakdowns can be, or should be, resolved. Instead, we offer a series of qualities that characterize subject positions in human-computer relationships beyond "use." For each quality, we also offer a conceptual strategy that can be used to grapple with such situations. As HCI researchers and practitioners do so, they
v3r2 | 6295
nv42 | Interactive Design Methodologies
xags | can contribute insights they have gained toward a broader understanding of designing for an ecology of subject positions. To reiterate, an ecology in this context includes a depiction of each subject position, an enumeration of the relationships among them, and a description each's relationship to the technology interaction.
jc47 | Each of the following subsections offers a quality that certain subject positions might have, along with a strategy to account for such subject positions in design. For instance, when your ecology of subject positions involves indirection, you might consider designing for delegates.
ko3c | Indirection
xek3 | Indirection involves cases where the person using the system does so on behalf of another. A prime example can be seen in intermediated interactions [75]. Based on ethnographic work in two urban slums in Bangalore, Sambasivan et al. describe cases in which surrogates act on behalf of users who, for reasons including illiteracy and limited technological abilities, cannot engage in the interaction themselves. In these cases, users interact with the system indirectly through an intermediary. As another example, some rural communities have a single household with a telephone or computer [71]. Similar situations sometimes arise in Old Order Amish communities to constrain the influence that such technologies have on the community [85]. In these cases, the householder who has telephone or Internet access acts as a relay for others. In organizational contexts, one employee, often an assistant, may schedule meetings or respond to email on behalf of another, often a supervisor [95,96] [cf. 32]. This work of surrogates and collaborative use can also be seen in care workers for the elderly or cognitively impaired [72]. One could also consider the navigation of airplanes or naval ships, often used as object lessons for distributed cognition [51]. A commanding officer navigates indirectly, collecting information and issuing commands through the individuals observing and operating the vessel's various instruments (compass, speedometer, steering, etc.).
bbpr | In each of these cases, the concept of the user breaks down across levels of representation. Consider Sambasivan et al.'s [75] intermediated interaction and email systems: At the systems level, there is a single person who is authenticated and accessing their email data. At the interface level, the person who is sending and receiving those emails interacts via the intermediary, not with the technology itself. At the design level, the concepts of authentication and access codify the one-to-one correspondence between human user and user account, omitting the possibility of other configurations. At the ideological level, we might be interested in accounting both for the intermediary user and for the person on whose behalf the intermediary is functioning. However, those two subject positions are absent at other representational levels (systems, interface, design process). Similar disconnects

9own | across levels of representation occur in the other cases mentioned above.
