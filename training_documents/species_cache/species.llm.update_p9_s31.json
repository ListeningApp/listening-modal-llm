        "content": "```\nncb0 | Finally, we identify four key challenges for future research and management-namely, assessing the impacts of neonatives on recipient ecosystems, identifying the drivers of rapid range expansion and the specific traits that favor successful range expansion and the different biological and ecological characteristics of neonatives in comparison to resident native and alien species, debating management options and conservation benefits of neonatives, and potentially recognizing neonative species in legislation and policies for management. For these challenges, we provide recommendations for science and biodiversity management of neonatives. Although some of these challenges address basic gaps in knowledge and understanding, others are aiming to improve the transfer of scientific understanding to biodiversity management and policy.\n8mp0 | Conclusions\nxjyk | There have always been species range dynamics, and there will be natural range dynamics in the future. However, we\nmt0f | believe that it is useful to distinguish natural range dynamics from those facilitated by human-induced environmental change. Therefore, expanding the list of currently used categories of biogeographic status to recognize this increasingly important component of regional species pools is warranted and useful for better communication and understanding among scientists, policy makers and managers, which undoubtedly will benefit conservation efforts.\nawab | Neonatives are currently treated by most international regulations as natives. We support such a classification, albeit as a distinct subcategory from resident natives. Similarly, there will undoubtedly be different opinions on the issue of using temporal and spatial thresholds for identifying neonatives. These issues clearly warrant further discussion among scientists and biodiversity managers.\nixcc | In any case, we conclude that in the future, neonatives should be explicitly considered in global and regional scenarios for biodiversity management to increase clarity and to decrease undesirable effects. For example, policies aimed at increasing ecological connectivity should give explicit consideration to the potential movements of such species. Research should develop approaches for predicting their potential impacts on ecosystems and human well-being.\n8p6h | \npmgl | \n```\n",
