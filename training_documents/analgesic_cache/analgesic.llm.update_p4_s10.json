        "content": "zse6 | Before analgesic drug administration, TX B two concentrations were not different among groups. After drug administration, concentrations were decreased at all time points in all groups P is less than point zero zero zero one; Figure one. However, there was a highly significant increase between zero point five and four hours in M P equals zero point zero zero zero four. TX B two concentrations were higher in M than D twelve point five and D twenty-five at four hours P equals zero point zero zero three and P is less than point zero zero zero one, respectively, and at twenty-four hours P equals zero point zero zero seven and P equals zero point zero one one, respectively.\np2n3 | P G E two concentrations did not differ among groups before drug administration. At four hours, P G E two concentration was higher in D twenty-five than in M P equals zero point zero four eight; Figure one. P G E two concentration had decreased in D twelve point five at zero point five hour P equals zero point zero zero zero one and four hours P equals zero point zero one one; in D twenty-five at zero point five hour P is less than zero point zero zero zero one, four hours P equals zero point zero zero zero one and twenty-four hours P equals zero point zero zero zero four; and in M at zero point five and four hours P equals zero point zero zero two and P equals zero point zero zero seven, respectively.\nohh7 | \nvbni | There were no significant differences regarding laboratory test results, except for SDMA. When compared with SD before anesthesia, SDMA concentration was lower at twenty-four hours in M P equals zero point zero one two two and higher at seven days postoperatively than at twenty-four hours in D twenty-five and M P equals zero point zero three eight and P equals zero point zero two six, respectively; Figure two. There were no significant differences among groups. A high SDMA concentration fifteen micrograms per deciliter was measured in a single cat in M at seven days.\ndgcw | Sialorrhea was observed in all cats administered dipyrone drops orally at home. No emesis or alterations in food and water intake were observed.\ngvwz | The respiratory frequency was not significantly different postoperatively among groups or time points (Table one). Heart rate did not differ among groups, but was increased at one hour compared with baseline in M P equals zero point zero three three; Table one. Rectal temperature was decreased one hour after anesthesia compared with baseline in all groups. Blood glucose concentrations were not different among groups, but were higher than hours in D twenty-five P equals zero point zero one eight and at one\nsk5m | hour in M P equals zero point zero two zero; Table one. Pain scores did not differ significantly among groups; however, VAS scores were significantly higher than baseline in D twelve point five at four hours P equals zero point zero four one five; Figure three. A correlation between pain scales indicated a moderate VAS times MCPS R equals zero point four five three six, strong CSU-FAPS times MCPS: R equals zero point six six three four VAS times CMPS-F; R equals zero point seven zero two one MCPS times CMPS-F; R equals zero point seven one five two or very strong association VAS times CSU-FAPS; R equals zero point eight three one three. Sedation numbers were increased at one hour after first analgesic administration in all groups P is less than zero point zero zero zero one; Table two. There were no significant differences among groups regarding the need for rescue analgesia, even though the time of administration differed among groups (Table three). A total of eight cats required a single tramadol administration; four, two and two in groups D twenty-five, D twelve point five and M, respectively.\nqws8 | Discussion\n877u | Surprisingly, dipyrone at both doses inhibited COX-one and COX-two for twenty-four hours and zero point five hour, respectively, in cats.
