        "content": "gx97 | A therapeutic mode is a specific way of relating to a client. Six therapeutic modes have been identified in previous work as occurring with a high level of frequency in occupational therapy practice relationships. In this chapter, each of these six modes is described, and examples are provided to illustrate the multiple ways in which the primary modes can be combined and utilized during therapeutic interactions with clients. Practical applications of each mode for specific client characteristics and interpersonal events are discussed. Moreover, the chapter provides a rationale for the importance of the modes to the interpersonal reasoning process within the Intentional Relationship Model.\nppkp | Our Interpersonal Behavior\n8br6 | How we relate to others in our day-to-day lives may vary as a function of our current mood state, social and environmental context, and the interpersonal behavior of.\nde3k | Created from ubc on two thousand twenty-five-September-zero-seven.0449. fries With context.

Examples of these strategies are empathy, compassion, hopefulness, altruism, kindness, assertiveness, competitiveness, deference, dominance, passivity, resistance, avoidance, emotionality, restraint, power, aggression, suspiciousness, emotional disengagement, and isolative behavior.\n3h7w | Highly adaptive individuals are able to draw upon these and other strategies in an ever-changing and flexible manner in an attempt to adapt to the social demands of life. For example, a woman who is otherwise outgoing and gregarious at parties may significantly limit the extent to which she talks and socializes at a funeral if the social atmosphere is such that it requires silence and solemnity.\nth5p | By contrast, individuals who are not as interpersonally adaptive tend to overutilize a small set of interpersonal strategies in inflexible, maladaptive, or compulsive ways. For example, an individual whose primary objectives in relating to others involve self-preservation, resource acquisition, and a desire for power concerning others may consistently come across as confident, charming, competitive, and, at times, dominant, even when the situation requires humility and deference.\nb7nk | Mutually supportive behaviors. If the previously described individual is unable to demonstrate other characteristics necessary for collaborative activities, such as deference, thoughtfulness, kindness, and empathy, negative consequences are likely to result when these characteristics are needed. For example, an individual with a more fixed style may become emotionally fatigued, may struggle to move into alternative roles within the group, or may even act to interfere with someone else's attempt to move into a position of power. Others in the group may grow fearful or resentful if they are not able to witness this person's humility, vulnerability, or attempts to share and be supportive.\ncbb5 | An individual with a greater capacity to draw on a wider range of characteristics is better able to establish appropriate relationships in both social situations. Thus, although our interpersonal behavior is relatively stable, we function best when we utilize interpersonal strategies in a flexible way and adapt to a wide range of individuals in a variety of social situations.\n5qcf | Interpersonal Behavior and Therapeutic Modes\n8u2c | Therapists' interpersonal behaviors are reflected in:\nc1e3 | Their fundamental motivation to serve others\n7pez | Their preferred approach to serving\nqs5t | The values they hold while serving\nen4s | The way in which therapists interact in their personal lives (outside of therapy) may also be reflected in the specific ways in which they behave and interact with their clients during therapy (i.e., therapeutic modes). Chapter three noted that therapeutic communication is optimal when therapists draw on a variety of modes consciously and flexibly. This has several implications. First, therapists should develop an awareness of their natural modes (i.e., the ones that flow from their interpersonal behavior in their daily personal lives). Second, they should develop the self-discipline to use these modes in response to client needs rather than in response to their own internal comfort levels. Third, therapists should be aware of the limits of the modes they use and, in some instances, develop the capacity to use modes beyond those that come naturally.\ncsb5 | The Six Therapeutic Modes\ni096 | Practice are presented in Figure four point three.\ntlzt | Collaborating\n6iyf | Encouraging\no1nk | The idea that a therapist merely needs to select the correct mode to produce a desirable outcome carries an\nmnaf | The same mode applied to similar situations may produce two opposing reactions in two different clients. A client's reactions are less a function of the mode choice and more a function of the interpersonal characteristics and immediate needs of the client. The case example at the beginning of this chapter illustrates this point with respect to the instructing mode. When Kamisha explained why she was asking Margarita questions about her daily occupations and roles, Margarita's daughter reacted negatively, whereas Margarita appeared to accept the explanation as being valid. It is important to keep in mind that modes are perceived, relativistic, and subjective. As such, they are best interpreted through the mind's eye of the client. Rather than the mode itself, the client's interpretation and experience of the mode is what determines which mode is most desirable at any given time.\n0yxe | Carrying this point a step further, it is even possible that the same mode applied to similar situations may produce vastly different reactions in the same client. For example, when Rigel used the instructing mode to educate Mr. Johnson about the assessment he was using, Mr. Johnson's nonverbal cues revealed that he was not interested. However, when Rigel used the same mode to explain the concept of brain plasticity as justification for why his early engagement in therapy is likely to facilitate functional improvement, Mr. Johnson's body language became more positive. Ultimately, he invites Rigel to return to work with him on the following day.",
