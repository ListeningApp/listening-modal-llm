        "content": "xags | A simple procedure for obtaining analytical quality solid-state reference electrodes by a solution cast method is shown. It is made possible by applying a cocktail containing the mixture of KBr, AgBr, and Ag nanoparticles suspended in PVC/DOS/THF solution and drop casting of the cocktail on Ag substrates. The soaking in two Molar KBr for approximately several hundred\njc47 | seconds is sufficient to activate the electrodes characterized with reproducible and stable potential. This potential is in the range of negative one hundred fifty-seven plus or minus two millivolts versus silver chloride electrode, which indicates that the operation mechanism is similar to that of the silver bromide reference electrode, but not the same owing to the role played by the composite heterogeneous membrane. Carefully designed tests to check the performance of the reference electrodes proved the insensitivity of the REF-Bromine electrodes to repeated and challenging changes in the solution composition, pH, concentration, mobility, and lipophilicity of ions, as well as the presence of redox species. Electrodes of this type possess comparable properties to high-quality commercially available reference electrodes. Additionally, as all-solid-state electrodes, they can be fabricated in miniaturized form and thus be applied when designing miniaturized multielectrode platforms and probes.\nko3c | ASSOCIATED CONTENT\nxek3 | Supporting Information",
