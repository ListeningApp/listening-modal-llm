A cognitive model is a set of production rules or skills encoded in intelligent tutors to model how students solve problems. It is usually generated by brainstorming and iterative refinement between subject experts, cognitive scientists and programmers. In this paper we propose a semi-automated method for improving a cognitive model called Learning Factors Analysis that combines a statistical model, human expertise and a combinatorial search. We use this method to evaluate an existing cognitive model and to generate and evaluate alternative models. We present improved cognitive models and make suggestions for improving the intelligent tutor based on those models.\nzlxc | One Introduction\nk0bw | A cognitive model is a set of production rules or skills encoded in intelligent tutors to model how students solve problems. (Production, skill, and rule are used interchangeably in this paper.) Productions embody the knowledge that students are trying to acquire, and allows the tutor to estimate each student's learning of each skill as the student works through the exercises.\naq5a | A good cognitive model captures the fine knowledge components in a curriculum, provides tailored feedback and hints, select problem with difficulty level and learning pace matched to individual students, and eventually, improves student learning. However, initial models are usually generated by brainstorming and iterative refinement between subject experts, cognitive scientists and programmers. These first pass models are best guesses and our experience is that such models can be improved.\nsc5y | In this paper, we propose a method called Learning Factors Analysis and use it to answer three questions relevant to the field of intelligent tutoring systems.\n0yab | One. How can we describe learning behavior in terms of an existing cognitive model? We need to identify the initial difficulty level of each production and how fast can a student learn each rule. We can then provide parameters that indicate student performance on this set of rules and how that performance improves with practice and instruction on those rules.\nw95z | Two. How can we evaluate and improve a cognitive model in an inexpensive way? We need to identify the causes of the deviation from the deterministic cognitive model, define the measures of a model's complexity and fit, and mine the student-tutor log data.\n0i1k | Three. How can we use the information from Learning Factors Analysis to improve the tutor and the curriculum? We need to identify over-taught or under-taught rules, and even \"hidden\" knowledge components within them. As a result, we can adjust their contribution to curriculum length without compromising student performance.\ndqlg | Two Literature Review\np6pq | One measure of the performance of a cognitive model is how the data fit the model. Newell and Rosenbloom found a power relationship between the error rate of performance and the amount of practice. Depicted by equation one, the relationship shows that the error rate decreases according to a power function as the amount of practice increase. The curve for the equation is called a \"learning curve\".\nzse6 | One\np2n3 | Y equals A X to the power of B.\nohh7 | where\nvbni | Y equals the error rate. X equals the number of opportunities to practice a skill. A equals the error rate on the first trial, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of a skill. B equals the learning rate, reflecting how easy a skill is to learn.\ndgcw | The learning curve model has been used to visually identify non-obvious or \"hidden\" knowledge components. Corbett and Anderson observed that the power relationship might not be readily apparent in some complex skills, which have blips in their learning curves, as shown in figure two. They also found the power relationship holds if the complex skill can be decomposed into subskills, each of which exhibits a smoother learning curve.\ngvwz | As seen in the graphs above, the single production Declare-Parameter produces a learning curve with several blips. However by breaking it into two more specific productions, Declare-First-Parameter and Declare-Second-Parameter, the model becomes more fine-tuned and recognizes that the skills are different. The knowledge decomposition, considering parameter position, that was non-obvious from the original model became revealed on closer inspection of learning curve data.\nsk5m | Other approaches to model refinement include having a simulated student to find incorrect rules and to learn new rules via human tutor intervention, using theory refinement to introduce errors to models incorrect student behaviors and using Q-matrix to discover knowledge structure from student response data. Compared with the simulated student approach, our method does not require building a simulated student. The theory refinement approach starts with an initial knowledge base and keeps correcting errors in the knowledge base from error examples until the knowledge base is consistent with the examples. It may lead to overfit the examples. The Q-matrix approach was used to automatically extract features in the problem set. The model found by this approach may be similar to the model adding or merging difficulty factors in our method.\nqws8 | Three The Cognitive Model and Its Data Under Investigation\n877u | We illustrate the Learning Factors Analysis methodology using data obtained from the Area Unit of the Geometry Cognitive Tutor. The initial cognitive model implemented in the Tutor had fifteen skills that correspond to productions or, in some cases, groups of productions. The productions are\nrzhj | Circle-area - Given the radius, find the area of a circle. Circle-circumference - Given the diameter, find the circumference of a circle. Circle-diameter - Given the radius or circumference, find the diameter of a circle. Circle-radius - Find the radius given the area, circumference, or diameter. Compose-by-addition - In A plus B equals C, given any two of A, B, or C, find the third. Compose-by-multiplication - In A times B equals C, given any two of A, B, or C, find the third. Parallelogram-area - Given the base and height, find the area of a parallelogram. Parallelogram-side - Given the area and height, or base, find the base or height. Pentagon-area - Given a side and the apothem, find the area of a pentagon. Pentagon-side - Given area and apothem, find the side or apothem.\nbfax | Trapezoid-area - Given the height and both bases, find the area of a trapezoid. Trapezoid-base - Given area and height, find the base of a trapezoid. Trapezoid-height - Given the area and the base, find the height of a trapezoid. Triangle-area - Given the base and height, find the area of a triangle. Triangle-side - Given the base and side, find the height of a triangle.\nf2y8 | Our data consist of four thousand one hundred two data points involving twenty-four students, and one hundred fifteen problem steps. Each data point is a correct or incorrect student action corresponding to a single production execution. Table one displays typical student action records in this data set. It has five columns - student, success, step, skill, and opportunities. Student is the names of the students. Success is whether the student did that step correctly or not in the fist attempt. One means success and zero, failure. Step is the particular step in a tutor\no7qm | problem the students are involved in. \"problem one step one\" stands for problem one step one. Skill is the production rule used in that step. Opportunities mean the number of previous times to use a particular skill. It increments every time the skill is used by the same student, and can be computed from the first and fourth columns.\nd52l | Four Learning Factor Analysis\nqlbb | Learning Factor Analysis has three components: a statistical model that quantifies the skills, the difficulty factors that may affect student performance in the tutor curriculum, and a combinatorial search that does model selection.\nnhsg | Four point one The Statistical Model\nhy0l | The power law model applies to individual skills and does not typically include student effects. Because the existing cognitive model has multiple rules, and the data contains multiple students, we made four assumptions about student learning to extend the power law model.\n4jmz | One. Different students may initially know more or less. Thus, we use an intercept parameter for each student.",
