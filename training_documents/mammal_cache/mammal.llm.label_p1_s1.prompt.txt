You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

v6sk | EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY DNA methylation networks underlying mammalian traits
1wj6 | INTRODUCTION: Comparative epigenomics is an emerging field that combines epigenetic signatures with phylogenetic relationships to elucidate species characteristics such as max- imum life span. For this study, we generated cytosine DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles <LATEX>\left( n = 1 5 , 4 5 6 \right)</LATEX> from 348 mammalian species using a methylation array platform that targets highly conserved cytosines.

2taz | RESULTS: We first tested whether DNAm levels in highly conserved cytosines captured phylo- genetic relationships among species. We con- structed phyloepigenetic trees that paralleled the traditional phylogeny. To avoid potential confounding by different tissue types, we gen- erated tissue-specific phyloepigenetic trees. The
o3ya | Check for updates
r5il | high phyloepigenetic-phylogenetic congru is due to differences in methylation levels is not confounded by sequence conservation.
5gui | We then interrogated the extent to which DNA methylation associates with specific bio- logical traits. We used an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to iden- tify clusters of highly correlated CpGs (comet- hylation modules). WGCNA identified 55 distinct comethylation modules, of which 30 were sig- nificantly associated with traits including max- imum life span, adult weight, age, sex, human mortality risk, or perturbations that modulate murine life span.
82qc | Both the epigenome-wide association anal- ysis (EWAS) and eigengene-based analysis iden- tified methylation signatures of maximum life span, and most of these were independent of aging, presumably set at birth, and could be stable predictors of life span at any point in life. Several CpGs that are more highly methylated in long-lived species are located near HOXL sub- class homeoboxes and other genes that play a role in morphogenesis and development. Some of these life span-related CpGs are located next to genes that are also implicated in our analysis of upstream regulators (e.g.,ASCL1 and SMAD6). CpGs with methylation levels that are inverse- ly related to life span are enriched in transcrip- tional start site (TSS1) and promoter flanking (PromF4, PromF5) associated chromatin states. Genes located in chromatin state TSS1 are con- stitutively active and enriched for nucleic acid metabolic processes. This suggests that long-living species evolved mechanisms that maintain low methylation levels in these chromatin states that would favor higher expression levels of genes essential for an organism's survival.

tzt3 | The upstream regulator analysis of the EWAS of life span identified the pluripotency tran- scription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Other factors, such as POLII, CTCF, RAD21, <LATEX>Y Y 1 , a n d \quad T A F 1 ,</LATEX> showed the strongest enrich- ment for negatively life span-related CpGs.
t8vv | CONCLUSION: The phyloepigenetic trees indi- cate that divergence of DNA methylation pro- files closely parallels that of genetics through evolution. Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation is subjected to evolutionary pres- sures and selection. The publicly available data from our Mammalian Methylation Consortium are a rich source of information for different fields such as evolutionary biology, develop- mental biology, and aging.

5746 | EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY DNA methylation networks underlying mammalian traits
7toz | Using DNA methylation profiles (n = 15,456) from 348 mammalian species, we constructed phyloepigenetic trees that bear marked similarities to traditional phylogenetic ones. Using unsupervised clustering across all samples, we identified 55 distinct cytosine modules, of which 30 are related to traits such as maximum life span, adult weight, age, sex, and human mortality risk. Maximum life span is associated with methylation levels in HOXL subclass homeobox genes and developmental processes and is potentially regulated by pluripotency transcription factors. The methylation state of some modules responds to perturbations such as caloric restriction, ablation of growth hormone receptors, consumption of high-fat diets, and expression of Yamanaka factors. This study reveals an intertwined evolution of the genome and epigenome that mediates the biological characteristics and traits of different mammalian species.

4i0e | Our study overcomes these constraints in several ways. First, we used a measurement platform ensuring high effective sequencing depth at conserved CpGs, allowing for a more precise analysis of DNAm patterns in highly conserved DNA regions. Second, we increased the sample size per species, aiming for many samples per species. We profiled 348 species from 25 of the 26 mammalian taxonomic orders. This comprehensive dataset enables examina- tion of phylogenetic relationships, comethyla- tion relationships between cytosines, and their associations with maximum life span and other species characteristics.

dfzb | We profiled 15,456 samples (Fig. 1A and table S1) using a methylation array platform that provides effective sequencing depth at highly conserved CpGs across mammalian spe- cies (5). This dataset is the product of the multinational Mammalian Methylation Con- sortium. In previous studies, we applied super- vised machine learning methods to generate DNAm-based predictors of age called epige- netic clocks for numerous species (6-31).
u6ty | Here, we performed a large-scale cross-species unsupervised analysis of the entire dataset to reveal the relationship of DNAm with mam- malian phylogeny. We show that we could construct phyloepigenetic trees that parallel traditional phylogenetic ones. We then pro- ceed to interrogate the extent to which DNAm underpins specific biological traits by using unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to minimize the influence of bias on our observations. This approach iden- tifies modules (clusters) of comethylated CpGs comethylation that are associated with species characteristics, including taxonomy, tissue type, sex, life span, and aging.

on9b | We generated a dataset consisting of DNAm profiles of 15,456 DNA samples derived from 70 tissue types from 348 mammalian species using the mammalian methylation array (5). We evaluated whether methylation levels of cytosines (CpGs) in DNA sequences that are conserved across species would allow us to construct what could be called a phyloepige- netic tree. To avoid potential confounding by different tissue types, we generated tissue- specific phyloepigenetic trees (Fig. 1B and figs. S2 and S3). We defined the "congruence" be- tween traditional phylogenetic trees and phylo- epigenetic trees as the Pearson correlation coefficient between distances (branch length) based on phyloepigenetic trees and evolutionary

(D) Scatter plots displaying the log-odds ratios of regions exhibiting phylogenetic signals relative to the TSS are presented. The phylogenetic signal is determined using Blomberg's K statistic (32). In this analysis, CpGs were grouped into categories using sliding windows relative to the TSS. To assess enrichment, the Fisher's exact overlap test was used, focusing on the top 500 CpGs displaying phylogenetic signals within each region. The red dots highlight the regions with the Fisher's exact P value < 0.05. The results indicate notable enrichment (OR > 3) in certain intergenic and genic regions but not in promoters.

iwn5 | To identify CpGs that exhibit a pronounced phylogenetic signal in relation to methylation and phylogenetic trees, we used Blomberg's K statistic (32). Among the top 500 CpGs show- ing significant phylogenetic signals (nominal Blomberg <LATEX>P < 0 . 0 0 1 ,</LATEX> selected by variance <LATEX>z</LATEX> score), we observed an enrichment in upstream intergenic regions [odds ratio <LATEX>\left( O R \right) = 1 . 4 ,</LATEX> Fisher's exact <LATEX>P < 0 . 0 5 ;</LATEX> fig. S4B]. To further investi- gate regions with the strongest phylogenetic signal, we divided the data into groups rela- tive to the transcriptional start sites (TSSs). This analysis also confirmed that intergenic regions exhibit significant phylogenetic sig- nals <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { O R } > 3 \right. ,</LATEX> Fisher's exact <LATEX>\left.

We then summarized their methylation profiles as "module eigen- genes." The respective eigengenes of these modules were used to identify their potential correlations with various traits within and across mammalian species.
