You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

The heatmap shows the enrichments between (1) mammalian comethylation modules and significant life span-related EWAS CpG groups (x axis) and (2) chromatin states or other genomic annotation (y axis). Cell shading corresponds to log- transformed fold enrichment values (observed CpG count divided by expected count). Hypergeometric tests were used to evaluate the enrichment significance in each cell. * Nominal <LATEX>P < 0 . 0 0 1</LATEX> <LATEX>\left( F D R < 0 . 1 0 \right) .</LATEX> Only chromatin states and external genome annotations with at least one significant enrichment <LATEX>\left( \mathrm { F D R } < 0 . 1 0 \right)</LATEX> are shown.

The chromatin states are learned based on epigenetic datasets profiling chromatin mark signals in different human cell and tissue types, resulting in a genome annotation shared across cell types (41). The common partially methylated domains (commonPMD), solo CpGs (WCGW), and highly methylated domain (HMD) annotations are from (42). PRC1 and PRC2 binding sites are obtained from the ChIP-seq datasets of PCR1 and PCR2 from ENCODE (45).

qws8 | We found that 30 of the resulting 55 mod- ules identified from an unsupervised machine learning method were readily associated with species traits (taxonomic order, maximum life span, and average adult weight) or individual traits (chronological age, tissue, and sex). We expect that many of the remaining 25 modules will be associated with biological characteristics about which we currently have no information. As a case in point, although the yellow module was not associated with any of our primary tested traits, it did show association with re- sponse to a murine circadian rhythm disrup- tion study (light pollution during the night; fig. S7B). The upstream regulator analysis of the EWAS of life span identified the pluripo- tency transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. We showed that the transient over- expression of OSKM in murine tissues affects the methylation levels of CpGs near genes im- plicated by our EWAS of maximum life span (Fig. 5E). We speculate that the enhanced ac- tivity of the pluripotency network in long-lived species results in more efficient tissue repair and maintenance, ensuring a longer life span.
877u | Both the EWAS and eigengene-based analy- ses identified methylation signatures of max- imum life span presumably established at birth. Most of these were independent of aging and interventions that affect murine mortality risk. Several CpGs that are more highly methyl- ated in long-lived species are located near HOXL subclass homeoboxes and other genes that play a role in morphogenesis and development. Some of these life span-related CpGs are located next to genes that are also implicated in our analysis of upstream regulators (e.g., ASCL1 and SMAD6).
rzhj | CpGs with methylation levels that are in- versely related to life span are enriched in TSS1- and promoter flanking (PromF4 and PromF5)-associated chromatin states. Genes located in chromatin state TSS1 are constitu- tively active and enriched for nucleic acid metabolic processes (41). This could imply that long-lived species either evolved selective mechanisms to maintain low methylation levels near TSSs or may have adaptations that pro- mote the high expression of essential genes. This high expression may indirectly prompt more active DNA demethylation mechanisms.

qlbb | For unsupervised analysis, we formed WGCNA networks based on two sets of CpG probes in our data. The first network was generated from 14,705 conserved CpGs in 10,927 sam- ples of 167 eutherian species. The preservation of this network was evaluated in an indepen- dent dataset comprising 3692 samples from 29 tissues of 228 mammalian species (164 new species; 64 overlapped with the training set). The second network was a subset of 7956 con- served CpGs in 11,105 samples from 167 euthe- rian and nine marsupial species. In addition, we developed seven consensus comethylation networks to remove the confounding effects of species and tissue type. Consensus WGCNA can be interpreted as a meta-analysis across networks in different species and tissue types (33, 43).
nhsg | For the eutherian network (Net1), module eigengenes (MEs) were defined as singular vectors (corresponding to the highest singular value) from the singular value decomposition of the scaled CpGs that underlie the respective module. The eigengenes in the eutherian net- work (Net1) explained a range of 24 to 63% (average 43%) of the variance in the methyla- tion data in the training set, replication set, and all data in each module (table S3). For a given module, we defined the measure of mod- ule membership (kME) as the Pearson correla- tion between the module eigengene and the CpGs. The association of module eigengenes was examined for different traits using indi- vidual regression models.
hy0l | EWAS of life span was done in 28,318 CpGs that apply to mice and humans according to calibration and titration data (correlation with calibration exceeds 0.8) and mappability infor- mation as described in (5). Because the distrib- ution of maximum life span and other life history traits were highly skewed, we imposed a log transformation on these phenotypes before conducting EWAS. Our tissue type- specific EWAS was conducted in tissues with enough species <LATEX>\left( N > 2 5 \right)</LATEX> available. For our var- ious EWAS of log-transformed maximum life span, significance thresh- old <LATEX>1 8 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \left( 0 . 0 1 / 2 8 , 3 1 8 \right)</LATEX> based on the conservative Bonferroni adjustment. We report an FDR in our enrichment studies to adjust for multiple comparisons.

lvae | Editor's summary
o9sc | DNA methylation installs a methyl group to cytosine, placing an epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression. Comparative epigenomics combines epigenetic signatures with phylogenetic relationships to understand species characteristics. Haghani et al. evaluated methylation levels in highly conserved DNA sequences, profiling ~15,000 samples across 348 mammalian species (see the Perspective by de Mendoza). Phylogenetic trees suggest that the divergence of DNA methylation profiles closely mirrors genetic evolution. Species with longer maximum life spans have developed tidier methylation patterns within the genome, characterized by unique peaks and troughs of methylation. Methylation patterns associated with maximum life spans generally differ from those connected to age or interventions that affect mortality risk in mice. These data provide a rich resource of information for fields including evolutionary biology and longevity research. - Di Jiang
