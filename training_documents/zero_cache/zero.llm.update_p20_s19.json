We thus define a natural language template for each atomic action and only expose the converted natural language text in all operations involving language models, i.e. autoregressive generation and action translation. After we obtain an entire generated program expressed in natural language, such as those in Figure One and Figure Two, we then convert each action step to the VirtualHome syntax. Full list of the atomic actions and their natural language templates can be found below.\nm9yn | A.5 Random Samples of Action Plans\ncg8u | Human\n2hsv | Task: Go to sleep Step One: Walk to bedroom Step Two: Walk to bed\n7s7l | Step Three: Find bed Step Four: Turn to bed\nuwdf | Step Five: Look at bed\njjgp | Step Six: Sit on bed Step Seven: Sleep\ndf4g | Task: Browse internet Step One: Walk to home office Step Two: Walk to chair Step Three: Find chair Step Four: Sit on chair Step Five: Find computer Step Six: Switch on computer Step Seven: Turn to computer Step Eight: Look at computer\nqc2j | Step Nine: Find keyboard Step Ten: Type on keyboard\nx3oh | Task: Wash teeth Step One: Stand up Step Two: Walk to bathroom Step Three: Walk to sink Step Four: Find sink Step Five: Turn to sink Step Six: Look at sink Step Seven: Find teeth\nfqvx | Step Eight: Wash teeth\nviae | Step One: Walk to bathroom Step Two: Walk to tooth paste Step Three: Find tooth paste Step Four: Grab tooth paste Step Five: Find toothbrush Step Six: Put toothpaste on tooth- brush Step Seven: Put toothbrush in mouth Step Eight: Brush teeth\np8u9 | Task: Brush teeth\n49ky | Step Six: Grab toothbrush\np5wo | Task: Vacuum Step One: Walk to home office Step Two: Walk to computer Step Three: Find vacuum cleaner Step Four: Switch on vacuum cleaner Step Five: Switch off vacuum cleaner\n74rp | Vanilla GPT3-One hundred seventy-five B\noolg | Task: Go to sleep Step One: Walk to bedroom Step Two: Walk to bed Step Three: Find pajamas Step Four: Put on pajamas Step Five: Find slippers Step Six: Put on slippers Step Seven: Get in bed Step Eight: Sleep Task: Browse internet Step One: Walk to home office Step Two: Walk to computer Step Three: Find computer Step Four: Grab computer Step Five: Find chair Step Six: Sit on chair\n3ewf | Step Seven: Browse internet Task: Wash teeth Step One: Walk to bathroom Step Two: Walk to sink Step Three: Turn on faucet Step Four: Grab toothbrush Step Five: Put toothpaste on tooth- brush Step Six: Put toothbrush in mouth Step Seven: Brush teeth Step Eight: Rinse mouth out with wa- ter Step Nine: Turn off faucet Step Ten: Walk back to bedroom\n5iea | Task: Brush teeth Step One: Walk to bathroom Step Two: Walk to sink\n62l5 | Step Three: Turn on water Step Four: Grab toothbrush\nshub | Task: Vacuum Step One: Walk to home office Step Two: Walk to vacuum Step Three: Find vacuum Step Four: Grab vacuum\nzjn5 | Step Five: Find chair Step Six: Sit on chair\nw8ia | Step Seven: Vacuum\n4vej | Translated GPT3-One hundred seventy-five B (Ours)\n8ut1 | Task: Go to sleep Step One: Walk to bedroom Step Two: Walk to bed Step Three: Lie on bed Step Four: Sleep\n6o35 | Task: Browse internet Step One: Walk to home office Step Two: Walk to desk Step Three: Find chair Step Four: Sit on chair Step Five: Find computer Step Six: Switch on computer Step Seven: Find mouse Step Eight: Grab mouse Step Nine: Turn to computer Step Ten: Point at computer\n8r63 | Task: Wash teeth Step One: Walk to bathroom Step Two: Walk to sink Step Three: Find faucet Step Four: Switch on faucet\nqze0 | Step Five: Walk to toothbrush Step Six: Grab toothbrush\no3m2 | Task: Brush teeth Step One: Find toothbrush Step Two: Turn to toothbrush Step Three: Point at toothbrush Step Four: Wash toothbrush\nkro9 | Task: Vacuum\ni438 | Step One: Walk to home office Step Two: Walk to dresser Step Three: Open dresser\nyr7b | Step Four: Find vacuum cleaner Step Five: Grab vacuum cleaner Step Six: Pull vacuum cleaner Step Seven: Plug in vacuum cleaner Step Eight: Switch on vacuum cleaner\n60hk | Task: Pick up toys Step One: Walk to bedroom Step Two: Walk to toy Step Three: Find toy Step Four: Grab toy\n5djf | Step Five: Walk to filing cabinet\nhem5 | Step Six: Open filing cabinet\nvfd9 | Step Seven: Put toy on filing cabinet Step Eight: Find toy Step Nine: Grab toy\njkgk | Step Ten: Walk to filing cabinet Step Eleven: Put toy on filing cabinet Step Twelve: Find toy\n8nom | Step Thirteen: Grab toy\nvsjd | Step Fourteen: Walk to filing cabinet Step Fifteen: Put toy on filing cabinet Step Sixteen: Close filing cabinet\ntucm | Task: Decorate it\nprly | Step One: Walk to home office Step Two: Walk to centerpiece Step Three: Find centerpiece Step Four: Grab centerpiece\n2epy | Step Five: Walk to table Step Six: Put centerpiece on table Step Seven: Find drawing Step Eight: Grab drawing Step Nine: Find wall Step Ten: Turn to wall\nv55t | Step Eleven: Put drawing on wall Step Twelve: Find drawing Step Thirteen: Grab drawing\n53fa | Step Fourteen: Turn to wall Step Fifteen: Put drawing on wall\nnnb3 | Task: Put away groceries Step One: Walk to dining room Step Two: Walk to freezer\ns943 | Step Three: Find freezer Step Four: Open freezer\no7zd | Step Five: Find food Step Six: Grab food\nthxo | Step Seven: Put food in freezer\nb67w | Step Eight: Close freezer",
