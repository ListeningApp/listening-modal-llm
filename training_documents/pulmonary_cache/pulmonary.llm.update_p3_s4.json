        "content": "```\npk06 | A female researcher with a background in psychology and palliative care research conducted the interviews in participants' preferred locations, between October twenty eighteen and April twenty nineteen. She had previous training in qualitative research and experience in conducting interviews with people with serious illness and their families. She was not known to participants before the interviews.\n7wn9 | The interviews followed a\nwcd0 | semistructured interview topic guide developed with input from people with lived experience relevant to both COPD and frailty, and their informal carers. The topic guide explored participants' current health and priorities, support and unmet needs, and expectations and experiences of pulmonary rehabilitation. On the advice of the service user representatives, the researcher identified and used participants' own language in relation to frailty, for example, slowing down, difficulties walking, lack of strength or energy. Service user representatives also prompted the researcher to consider the participant's assets and resilience in addition to limitations. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The researcher completed detailed field notes to describe interview flow, contextual factors, participant responses, and initial reflections immediately after each interview.\ncaos | Data collection continued until the data set was deemed to be approaching thematic saturation, i.e., rich data with breadth and depth in relation to the study objectives, with evidence of replication across several participants. To determine potential thematic saturation, we conducted a preliminary analysis of the detailed reflective field notes, considering the above definition while also reflecting on Malterud and colleagues' dimensions of information power. These dimensions consider the data in relation to the breadth of the study aim, sample specificity, level of existing contributing theory, dialogue quality, and the need for cross-case analysis.\nqrvy | Analysis\npn9j | We conducted a reflexive thematic analysis to identify patterns of meaning within the data. First, one researcher familiarized themselves with the data through revisiting the audio recordings, transcripts, and field notes. They generated initial codes to capture meaningful basic elements of the data in relation to the study objectives. A service user representative with qualitative analysis training also familiarized themselves with, and generated initial codes for, a sample of the data. Meanings were primarily considered at a semantic level, but with consideration of latent interpretations. The researcher inductively generated themes by reviewing and refining codes, and writing definitions accompanied by illustrative quotes. The themes and related codes were refined using three processes: revisiting the original interview data to ensure fair interpretation, comparing our findings with existing theory to assess if this may deepen our understanding, and review\n1pmc | by stakeholders with differing backgrounds to work toward a richer and more nuanced understanding of the data. The latter included review by coauthors from different disciplines and representing relevant academic, clinical, and service user experiences. Finally, we constructed a narrative of the findings, with reference to illustrative quotes. Although described as a linear process, we moved forward and backward between the stages as thinking changed and progressed.\n5z6q | Ethical Approval\nyeoh | The London Camberwell St Giles Research Ethics Committee approved this study. We obtained written informed consent prior to interviews.\nb8hf | Results\nhntf | Of forty-nine eligible people introduced to the study, nineteen were interviewed. Sixteen people who were eligible and went on to\n```",
