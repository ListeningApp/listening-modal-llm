You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

5jk8 | The people came to his church services for the first few weeks, and then came in smaller and smaller numbers. The only reason which they gave when questioned about their lack of interest is: 'It isn't what we thought it would be like.'
4cms | This shows (as you will find in innumerable Sufi stories) that neither the teacher nor the learner knows, without a real situation, how the teaching is to be carried on, if it is not done merely by indoctrination or emotional arousal, in specific instances.
iynx | The fact that teachers in many disciplines think that they know how to teach, and classes think that they know how to learn, obscures the fact that people in general accept this folkloric belief without testing. The only exception to both parties carrying on for centuries with diminishing returns is in areas, such as
ub6m | commerce, where nobody can afford to imagine things: tests have to be made.
a67b | THE DEMAND FOR LAUGHTER
8ibh | There is an instructive example in British television where many people complained about the production habit of putting a laughter sound-track onto shows, following every joke, or having a studio audience. Viewing audiences did not like it The Head of Light Entertainment at London Weekend Television in 1970 bowed to the bitter criticism and flood of letters by removing the laughing audience. The actors now complained that they could not act properly without laughter to help their timing. 'So', con- tinued Mr. Barry Took, 'I brought the audiences back, and everything was fine again. Almost exacdy the same people who had written in to complain wrote again to say how much they preferred the shows with audiences.'
elv7 | HOW TO SELL BOOKS TO SCHOLARS
oazo | When circularising scholars with lists of new books, we found a similar result. Postal advertisements couched in impeccable scholastic language brought hardly any sales. But circulars which were written like advertisements for soap-powder had large num- bers of these respectable gentlemen sending in their orders by return: even though the books were on serious subjects. When I mentioned this result in a newspaper interview, several academics wrote to me agreeing that they preferred an 'exciting' advertise- ment and that 'scholarly treatments' bored them ...
l85h | THE DEAD WHO WALK ...
he3v | Whether in the East or in the West, one of the difficulties in the way of transmitting Sufi knowledge has not changed in many centuries. As the Sufi ancient Abu'l Hasan Khirqani stated, 'Many people who are in reality dead are walking in the streets; many who are in their graves are in reality alive', he tells us, in Attar's lives of the masters.
y1kq | The difficulties of transmitting knowledge about which you ask
clin | mean that only a small number of people can immediately learn what is being taught. The others have to go through exposure to experience and teaching until their inward perceptions are able to connect with the transmission.
hiag | Many people believe that their interest in a subject is prepara- tion enough. Further, they cannot credit that others may have the perceptive capacity while they themselves must wait.
wfg5 | JUNAID AND THE JEALOUS STUDENTS
f5sm | Junaid illustrated this on the overt level one day when some of his twenty students were jealous of his attachment to one of their number. The parable-in-action which he devised is worth thinking about.
yw9n | He called all the disciples and ordered them to bring twenty fowls. Each pupil was instructed to take one bird to a place where he could not be seen, and to kill it.
8u3s | When they all returned, the birds were dead: all except the one taken by the controversial student.
hmg7 | Junaid asked him, in the presence of the others, why he had not killed his bird.
p0a7 | 'Because you told me to go to a place where I could not be seen, and there is no such place: God sees ah", answered the man.
ochb | The difficulty of transmission of knowledge is bound up with the orientation of the student. Wanting knowledge is not enough. As we see in the case of Junaid's students, only one in twenty acted in accordance with his own beliefs.
pcum | TEACHERSHIP ACCORDING TO MUINUDDIN CHISHTI
bu0s | The institution of teachership is there for this reason, that the learner must learn how to learn. Understanding this one realises why it is not an extreme statement to say, as did Muinuddin Chishti:
jr8i | 'It should be taken to heart that whatever the Spiritual Guide persuades his disciples to do and to practise, it is for the benefit of the spiritual disciple himself.'
7mby | Secrets and the Sufis
a1ha | Q: Why do Sufis hint at secrets, and speak of remarkable places and strange books, and so on, ifnot to titillate?
gkfg | THE CULTIVATED VOLUNTEERS
v9o7 | A: When they do so, it may only be to identify the super- ficialists who scramble for these things. This resembles the old Army technique when the sergeant says to recruits: 'Hands up those who are too cultivated for manual work'-and then, when some hands go up, says, 'These are the men who need the most training in manual labour!', and assigns them the roughest tasks.
gq1l | Another reason may be that what to you is titillating, is to me my everyday life. Words like 'remarkable', 'strange' and so on, have no absolute meaning, and are utterly subjective. What is the meaning of 'secret, strange, remarkable'?
90in | It is not unknown for Sufis to deal in things which cause people to react in this manner, in order to allow the audience to experience and to observe their own changes of mood and sensa- tion, to realise that too many people have too many buttons to be pressed in them, as it were.
8zn4 | There is no single answer to the question. Yet it is one of the most widely misunderstood: because careless students have as- sumed that Sufi teachings aimed at single individuals or groups, or intended for short-term uses, are perennial injunctions, applic- able under all circumstances. Much Sufi literature is no longer applicable, since the mentality of the audience has changed over the years.
exk3 | Rumi speaks of the matter of so-called secrets, when he says: 'If you do not see the secrets of truth, laugh at us ... '
tx5q | BREAD FOR THE HUNGRY
ly5j | Secrets and strange places and remarkable books, too, are often the current coin of the language in which uninstructed people
h2rq | think about certain matters. In order to connect with these people you may have to use their language at the outset. This does not make it your language. You remember the saying: 'To a hungry man, "two and two" means "four loaves of bread'"? If you are speaking to a hungry man, your first words might well be about bread.
9shl | If you want a shorter answer to the inference that Sufis simply want to titillate, here is an old proverb:
rur1 | 'If you believe it, and think that you are sure of it, know that you are in fact in need of improvement. Being sure and believing are stages to be superseded on the Path to Certainty.'
7ai3 | Words like 'secret', too, are technical terms among the Sufis. A better rendition of 'secret' is often 'innermost consciousness'.
xoe3 | When to have Meetings
ldca | Q: People hear about something and immediately crave it, as you have pointed out. Why does just any meeting with a teacher or a source of knowledge not produce results for the student?
pten | THE SPRING OF SWEET WATER
2aah | A: There is a Persian saying, from the classical Gulistan of Saadi, to this effect:
5ww2 | Wherever a spring of sweet water may be -
89h3 | Men, birds and ants will circle around it.
tbgj | Wherever there is a source of attraction, people will surround it, in accordance with their nature. I say, 'in accordance with their nature' because human beings resemble animals in being attracted to the aspect of things which immediately attracts them. As with animals, sometimes these things are suitable for them, sometimes not.
