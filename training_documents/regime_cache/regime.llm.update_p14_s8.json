The identity, equation two point thirty-five, holds for underdamped and overdamped Langevin under certain conditions. In view of this identity, as well as equations two point twenty, two point twenty-six, and two point twenty-four, and the definition, equation two point ten, of the conjugated response S, we can write\n0hs6 | rho subscript one equals the limit as eta approaches zero the fraction mathbb E subscript eta of R, all over eta equals the integral over mathcal X R mathfrak f subscript one psi subscript zero equals negative the integral over mathcal X left parenthesis mathcal L subscript zero inverse R right parenthesis left parenthesis widetilde mathcal L subscript phys end subscript star one right parenthesis psi subscript zero equals the integral from zero to positive infinity mathbb E subscript zero of R left parenthesis X subscript t right parenthesis S left parenthesis X subscript zero right parenthesis, d t, equation two point thirty-six\nm05x | where the expectation mathbb E subscript zero is over all initial conditions X subscript zero distributed according to the invariant measure psi subscript zero, and over all realizations of the reference dynamics at hand.

We emphasize that, as already discussed in Section two point one, the expression for S comes from the generator widetilde mathcal L subscript phys of the perturbation, and not the observable\nd1ee | R. The Green-Kubo formula shows that a nonequilibrium property, the transport coefficient rho subscript one in this case, can be computed using simulations at equilibrium, that is for\nitx4 | eta equals zero. Standard numerical techniques. Transport coefficients are often estimated in one of two ways:\nvwrs | One. Equilibrium techniques based on the Green-Kubo formula, equation two point thirty-six. To numerically estimate the quantity, equation two point thirty-six, one needs to discretize the continuous dynamics in time, using a fixed timestep Delta t greater than zero. This leads to the presence of some timestep bias of order O left parenthesis Delta t raised to the power theta right parenthesis, where theta depends on the numerical method at hand. Additionally, the time integral must be truncated\nxjkw | EXTENDING LINEAR RESPONSE WITH SYNTHETIC FORCINGS\nwght | to some finite integration time T. This leads to some truncation bias, which is small due to the exponential convergence of etCo.\n3lgb | Last but not least, the expectation is computed using empirical averages over K realizations. This naturally suggests the following estimator for p-one:\nttwt | PK,T equals the sum from k equals one to K of the integral of R of X k of X, d t, over K\nx5l2 | Although there are clear advantages to using equilibrium techniques, for instance, correlation functions for different conjugate responses can be computed simultaneously, there is also one major challenge in using, equation two point thirty-six. The integral is a correlation term, which is a small quantity for large t, plagued by a large statistical error. The statistical error is therefore the main source of error, as the variance is expected to scale linearly with the integration time T. More precisely, it is shown that the statistical error of PK,T is of order T over K.\nilrs | Overall, a tradeoff has to be considered for the choice of T as the bias is smaller for larger T while the variance increases with T.\n0a03 | Two. Nonequilibrium steady-state techniques. This method works by first approximating the limit in equation two point twenty by the finite difference En of R divided by n, with n sufficiently small to limit the bias, and next estimating the expectation with time averages as\nauae | equation two point thirty-eight. the integral from zero to t of R of X, ds,\n5b6y | for response functions with average zero with respect to psi subscript zero. When computing such steady-state averages over long trajectories, the asymptotic variance of the trajectory average computed using the discretized dynamics coincides at dominant order in n with the asymptotic variance of the trajectory average computed using the corresponding continuous dynamics.\n1y10 | One source of error is the systematic error due to three different biases. As discussed in Proposition two point four, the finiteness of the integration time leads to some bias of order one over n t, which is typically smaller than the statistical error. Additionally, the fact that we consider n approaching zero leads to some bias of order n, as a consequence of Lemma two point two. Lastly, the time discretization of the continuous dynamics also leads to some time step bias.\n6mnx | As discussed in Proposition two point four, the statistical error is dictated by a central limit theorem, so the variance of the estimator On,t scales as one over n squared t. The simulation time required to estimate P-one with a sufficient statistical accuracy therefore scales as t proportional to n to the negative two, leading to very long integration times t. Such long simulation times are often prohibitive in practical cases of interest. These results, and the tradeoffs to be considered, are discussed in more detail in Section two point three.\ntynp | Two point two point three. Application to mobility. The aim of this section is to illustrate the various previous results in the paradigmatic case of mobility. We consider the case where F is an element of R superscript d is a constant force, and the state-space is X equals T raised to the power d. We define the mobility for both overdamped Langevin and Langevin dynamics, and discuss how it is related to the self-diffusion by Einstein's relation.",
