First let's do a system with one degree of freedom where the energy is E of x equals x squared over two. In this case, after a change of variables, the Gibbs distribution becomes a Gaussian with mean zero and variance one, and that gives the desired result. Or just do the integrals and see what you get! The expected energy is one half k T.\nmwgi | PROOF OF THE EQUIPARTITION THEOREM: Two\ncjze | More general case: a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy E: R^n > R is F of x equals the norm of x squared over two\nrtvx | We can reduce this to the case with one degree of freedom:\nh0y1 | the expected energy equals R^n\nxxw0 | two T\nfv2x | e to the power of negative B the norm of x squared over two dn x\n663s | e to the power of negative B the norm of x squared over two dn x\n385i | J integral over R^n\nuhr9 | Next we do a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy is a sum of n terms of the form x squared over two. It's no surprise that each degree of freedom contributes one half k T to the expected energy, giving\n9w2j | the expected energy equals five n k T\nusxo | But make sure you follow my calculation above. I skipped a couple of steps!\n5fmi | PROOF OF THE EQUIPARTITION THEOREM: Three\nh8p7 | General case: a system with n degrees of freedom where the energy E : R^n to R is any positive definite quadratic form. Then\ngcbc | E of x equals one half the norm of A x squared for some invertible n by n matrix A . When A is a diagonal matrix this gives\nd9tz | E of x equals the sum from i equals one to n of c sub i x sub i squared over two for positive c sub i. We can reduce the general case to the previous case by a change of variables\ndusw | y equals A x\npk82 | Q of x equals the sum from i,j equals one to n of q sub i j x sub i x sub j for some numbers q sub i j in R. We say it's positive definite if\nblll | x not equal to zero implies Q of x greater than zero. One can prove that a quadratic form Q : R^n to R is positive definite if and only if\nocgf | Q of x equals one half the norm of A x squared for some invertible n by n matrix A . The factor of one half here is just to make our calculations easier.\ntybl | Thanks to this, if we have a system whose space of states is R^n and its energy function E : R^n to R is a positive definite quadratic form, we can compute\n80zt | the expected energy equals the integral over R^n E of x times the exponential of negative beta E of x d x divided by the integral over R^n of the exponential of negative beta E of x d x by reducing it to the previous case using a change of variables. We get\naxet | the expected energy equals one half n k T\ndrxk | So, each degree of freedom still contributes one half k T to the expected energy. That's the equipartition theorem!\n08na | But be careful. The equipartition theorem doesn't apply when the energy is an arbitrary function of n variables. It also fails when we switch from classical to quantum statistical mechanics.\n```",
