I'm talking heinous amounts of money. That being said, anyone can raise their prices, but only a select few can charge these rates and get people to say yes.\n1002 | From this point forward, you must abandon any notion you have about \"what's fair.\" Every enormous company in the world charges you money for things that cost them nothing. It costs pennies for the phone company to add an additional user, except they don't mind charging you hundreds per month for access. It costs pennies to manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, but they don't mind charging hundreds of dollars a month for it. Media companies charge advertisers a king's ransom for your eyeballs, and it costs them next to nothing to get you to like kitten photos on social media. You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.\nujk8 | Many entrepreneurs believe that charging \"too much\" is bad. The reality is that, yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more. And if you provide enough value, it should still always be a steal for the prospect. That is the power of value. It unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power to scale your company.\nfqbt | For example, one of my private clients (whose company I have equity in) is in the photography space. Over two years, implementing the tactics outlined in this book, the owner was able to increase the average ticket from three hundred dollars to one thousand five hundred dollars. That's a five times increase. Even cooler, they now spend less time per customer, and have higher customer satisfaction. The five times increase in average ticket, thirty-eight times the profit of the business. It went from making one thousand dollars per week in profit to thirty-eight thousand dollars per week in profit, and continues to grow. As a result, the company was finally able to continue to scale to multiple locations and provide meaningful work to great employees. And a fun benefit, we were able to donate even more money to children's charities which is something the owner and I have in common (almost five hundred thousand dollars at the time of this writing). But none of that would have been possible without figuring out what people valued most, tripling down on it, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else. A five times price increase may seem crazy to you, but clients voted with their dollars that what the company provides now is far better than what it did before. Cracking value opens up the world of unlimited profit, impact and possibilities.\nrkbk | Those who understand value are the ones who will be able to charge the most money for their services. The good news is that there is a repeatable formula that I have created to help quantify the variables that create value for any offer. I call it The Value Equation. Once you see it, you can never unsee it. It will operate in your subconscious, running in the background, calling out to you. It's a new lens through which to see the world.\nu1bd | The Value Equation\nq22z | PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVEMENT\nl8vb | DREAM OUTCOME\njrb6 | EQUALS VALUE\nptaj | TIME DELAY\nnusy | EFFORT AND SACRIFICE\ngsnv | If you want to know how I break down a business's core offering into something more valuable go to acquisition.com/offers and select the \"Value Equation\" video to watch a short tutorial. I also included a downloadable checklist. My goal is to gain your trust and deliver value in advance. As such, it's absolutely free. Enjoy.\n0mnu | As you can see from the picture, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease.\n3w0z | One. Yay. The Dream Outcome. Goal: Increase\nuwfw | Two. Yay. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement. Goal: Increase\n0caz | Three. Boo. Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement. Goal: Decrease\n4auz | Four. Boo. Perceived Effort and Sacrifice. Goal: Decrease\n6nou | If you noticed the questions in the last section that my father asked me, you'll see they corresponded with these pillars:\nxaqk | What will I make? Dream Outcome\na1ou | How will I know it's going to happen? Perceived Likelihood of Achievement\nzae5 | How long will it take? Time Delay\noa93 | What is expected of me? Effort and Sacrifice\nlcuj | Get The Bottom To Zero\ncua2 | In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement (social proof, third-party edification, etc). In other words, the top side of the equation. That's where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims. It's easy, and it's lazy.\nuipb | But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort and Sacrifice. The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate, seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. Amazon made purchasing a single click of a button and made purchases arrive almost immediately (maybe by the time you read this, they'll be sending drones to our doors within sixty minutes). Netflix made consuming television immediate and effortless. So, the older I get, the more I have shifted my focus to \"the hard stuff\" - decreasing the bottom side of the equation. And I believe the better you do this, the more you will be rewarded by the marketplace.\nbjno | Final note: The reason this is a division equation and not an addition is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you\nw2lh | can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you're golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by zero equals infinity. In other words, if you can reduce your prospects' true time delay to receiving value to zero (aka you realize your immediate dream outcome), and your effort and sacrifice is zero, you have an infinitely valuable product. If you accomplish this, you win the game.\nqryo | Given this postulate, a prospect would (in theory) purchase something from you, and the moment their credit card was run, it would immediately become their reality. That is infinite value.\nd0c0 | Imagine clicking the purchase button on a weight loss product and instantly seeing your stomach turn into a six-pack. Or imagine hiring a marketing firm, and as soon as you sign your document, your phone begins ringing with new highly qualified prospects. How valuable would these products or services be? Infinitely valuable. And that's the point.\nc4id | I don't know if we entrepreneurs will ever get there, but that is the hypothetical limit we all should strive towards, and why I structured the equation this way.\n2fj6 | Perception is Reality\n5mai | Perception is reality. It's not about how much you increase your prospect's likelihood of success, or decrease the time delay to achievement, or decrease their effort and sacrifice. That in itself is not valuable. Many times, they will have no idea. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.",
