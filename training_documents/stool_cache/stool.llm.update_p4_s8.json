C plus, culture positive; CFR, case fatality rate; PHC, primary health care; SM, smear microscopy; TB, tuberculosis.\nj30a | Indonesia and Ethiopia, we excluded case reports, non-English and non-human studies, and papers with terms for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, latent TB, gamma interferon release assay and tuberculin skin test in titles because of their relevance to TB infection, not active pulmonary TB. Searches were conducted between nineteenth October twenty twenty and twenty-sixth October twenty twenty. Finally, to inform remaining parameters, we sought opinion from TB experts from each country in an iterative process using a questionnaire, and remote workshops to explain the model and focus on parameters identified as influential by one-way sensitivity analysis. More details are provided in online supplemental appendix one and online supplemental appendix two A.\n7bdk | Cost parameters and health economic approach\nfim0 | We collected costs (reported in twenty nineteen U.S.D.) from the healthcare provider's perspective and adjusted historical costs for inflation to twenty nineteen prices using relevant gross domestic product deflators. We transferred costs from other countries to Ethiopia and Indonesia by applying relevant purchasing power parity conversion factors. All costs were assumed to accrue in the present, with no discounting applied.\nojro | We assumed the cost for the initial TB assessment at the PHC was equivalent to the country-specific cost of two outpatient visits (or a single outpatient visit for reassessment) to a health centre (health centre with no beds from WHO-CHOICE estimates). Similar assumptions were used for hospital assessment and reassessment with the corresponding WHO-CHOICE cost estimates. The cost of bacteriological investigation in the SOC includes the country specific unit cost of either SSM or Xpert, depending on availability at each level of care, adding the unit costs for collecting two sputum samples for testing with SSM or one sample for testing with Xpert. The unit costs for Xpert were estimated based on country specific data available from the OneHealth Tool. Country-specific unit costs for collecting sputum samples were not available and are based on a study done in adults from South Africa. In the intervention, we applied the unit cost for collecting a single stool sample based on estimates provided by the Paediatric Operational Sustainability Expertise Exchange group. Treatment cost for diagnosed TB comprises the cost of anti-TB drugs (including pyridoxine), from the Global Drug Facility, the costs of follow-up visits (drug pickups or medical review) according to national TB treatment guidelines at the healthcare facilities based on WHO-CHOICE unit cost estimates, and the costs of laboratory monitoring in bacteriologically confirmed TB only.\nl6t9 | We used a disability-adjusted life-year framework, calculating the life-years saved over a lifetime horizon with a discount rate of three percent based on United\n1ujy | Nations Population Division country-specific life tables. A simple mean across ages included in the zero to four and five to fourteen year age groups was used, and decrements in health-related quality of life or subsequent survival were not modelled.\nqzor | Metrics calculated\na0by | For every one hundred children seeking care with presumptive TB in each country, we calculated the deaths, DALYs, costs, referrals, clinical assessments, bacteriological assessments, ATTs, percent of true TB receiving ATT, percent of those receiving ATT bacteriologically confirmed, percent of those receiving ATT initiated at PHC, percent of ATT that is false-positive, as well as the change in these quantities under the intervention. We report the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. For each country, we produced plots of the cost-effectiveness plane, cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, and expected net benefit, and tornado plots illustrating the one-way sensitivity of outcomes to influential model parameters. We also undertook specific scenario analyses: (one) we considered a low TB prevalence scenario (half the base-case prevalence among presumptive TB patients); (two) we considered Xpert as the universally available bacteriological test instead of sputum-smear microscopy in SOC; (three) we considered discount rates of zero percent and five percent for the life-years. The results of these sensitivity analyses are included in online supplemental appendix three. Results are presented following the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards Statement.\nu1ky | Patient and public involvement\nhtm9 | Study participants or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.\n8hul | RESULTS\n87vz | Following our review of the literature, we developed the model parametrisation shown in table one. The data sources and approach to synthesis for each parameter are described in detail, respectively, in online supplemental appendices one and two A. Country-specific data were used to inform the proportion of children submitting a spontaneously expectorated sputum sample, the fraction of presumptive TB in children under five years, and the level of initial care-seeking at PHC. We used existing systematic reviews for the basis of parameters describing diagnostic test accuracy, our own pooled estimates of true TB prevalence among presumptive TB, the fraction of TB that is bacteriological confirmable and the fraction of children able to spontaneously expectorate. Evidence for the accuracy of clinical diagnosis was limited, and published evidence was completely lacking for other parameters around referral and reassessment. Hence, we based these on expert opinion. Unit costs used in the analysis are shown in table two.\nym66 | The intervention increased the sensitivity to detect true TB by over ten percentage points in each country and resulted in around a fourfold increase in the proportion of patients with TB diagnosed that are bacteriologically confirmed. Specificity showed little change under the intervention (less than one percent change). In both countries, the proportion of children referred (or self-referred) to higher levels of care after seeking care at PHC level fell by more than twofold. In both countries, the average total number of assessments for children with presumptive TB increased from around two per child under SOC to around two point five per child with the intervention, and the total number of bacteriological investigations increased more than threefold.\nl0a3 | The relative number of children initiated on ATT increased by nineteen to twenty-five percent under the intervention. A larger fraction (about forty percent relative increase) of children received ATT with the intervention, and more children (about ten percent point increase) initiated ATT at PHC level. Restricting to children under five, we found bigger increases in the number of bacteriological investigations (thirty-fold), and the proportion of TB cases diagnosed that are bacteriologically confirmed (fifty percent). We also found a larger reduction in referrals of children with presumptive TB to higher levels of care in both countries (almost threefold).\n```",
