You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

dqn8 | At <LATEX>p H = 5 ,</LATEX> the ET2-PT channel dominates over the entire range of potentials considered (Figure 6c). The concentration of <LATEX>\widetilde { \mathrm { R u } } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 }</LATEX> at this <LATEX>p H</LATEX> is much smaller, virtually eliminating the contribution from the ET1 channel. The EPT1 channel is also not accessible because the mole fraction of <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - \mathrm { O H } ^ { - } \cdots .</LATEX> H3O+ <LATEX>\left( O x \cdots H _ { 3 } O ^ { + } \right.</LATEX> is negligible at this pH. Moreover, ET2 is much faster than EPT2 due to its smaller reorganization energy. For these reasons, the ET2-PT channel is dominant at
cop0 | <LATEX>p H = 5 .</LATEX> <LATEX>P ^ { H } = S</LATEX> <LATEX>p H = 1 , 3 ,</LATEX> 5, the two major competing channels are the ET1 and ET2 channels, corresponding to PCET via the PTET and ETPT mechanisms, respectively. Both the ET1 and ET2 rate constants are pH-independent. The ET1 channel dominates at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and 3, whereas the ET2-PT channel dominates at <LATEX>p H = 5 .</LATEX> This interpretation is supported by the experimentally measured maximum rate constants and corresponding electronic coupling <LATEX>H _ { a b } ,</LATEX> which are similar at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and 3 but significantly different at <LATEX>p H = 5</LATEX> (see Figure 5a, where the maximum value is similar for the red and blue curves but different for the magenta curve). This experimental observation is consistent with the same dominant channel at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and 3 but a different dominant channel at <LATEX>p H = 5 .</LATEX> The weak <LATEX>p H</LATEX> dependence observed experimentally arises from the intrinsic difference between the rate constants of the ET1 and ET2-PT channels due to their distinct electronic coupling and the change of their relative contributions with <LATEX>p H</LATEX> due to the changes in the mole fractions of <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - \mathrm { O H } ^ { - }</LATEX> and
lhkq | <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } .</LATEX> This analysis also provides insights into the change of apparent reorganization energy at <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1 ,</LATEX> 3, and 5. The apparent reorganization energy is extracted as the driving force when <LATEX>k _ { \text { app } } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } k _ { \text { max,app } }</LATEX> At <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5, the <LATEX>k \left( E \right)</LATEX> curve is shifted toward lower potential compared to the curve at <LATEX>p H =</LATEX> 1, leading to larger apparent reorganization energies for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5 compared to <LATEX>\mathrm { p H } = 1 .</LATEX> These observations could be interpreted to suggest the same mechanism at <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5 and a different mechanism at <LATEX>p H = 1 .</LATEX> However, our general model suggests an alternative interpretation. The dominant channel is the same at <LATEX>p H = 1</LATEX> and <LATEX>p H = 3 ,</LATEX> and the curve shift for <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> leading to a higher apparent reorganization energy <LATEX>\begin{array}{} \text { is due to } \\ \text { \left(positive } \end{array}</LATEX> the negligible mole fraction of <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { H I } } - O \mathrm { H } _ { 2 }</LATEX> at high potentials and the increased mole fraction of <LATEX>R u ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> <LATEX>- O H _ { 2 }</LATEX> at lower potentials. At <LATEX>p H = 5 ,</LATEX> the ET2-PT channel dominates, and the difference in reduction potential for ET2 compared to ET1 leads to the curve shift. It is somewhat fortuitous that the apparent reorganization energy is nearly the same at <LATEX>p H = 3</LATEX> and 5.
82ju | Finally, we designed new experiments to test the model prediction of <LATEX>k _ { \max , \mathrm { a p p } }</LATEX> at higher <LATEX>p H .</LATEX> Figure 7a shows the structures of the catalyst when anchored to a metal oxide electrode. In the previous study, phosphonate anchor groups (top) were used. These anchors are unstable at <LATEX>p H > 5 ,</LATEX> thus prohibiting electrochemical PCET kinetics measurement at higher <LATEX>p H .</LATEX> Here, we prepared a new Ru-based water catalyst with siloxane anchor groups (bottom in Figure 7a). Detailed synthetic procedures and characterizations are provided in the SI. The siloxane anchor is stable over a much wider pH range of 0.5-12, allowing us to quantify the pH dependence over the

7fqw | entire pH range. Similar to the previously studied catalyst, when anchored on the ITO surface, this new <LATEX>R u ^ { I I }</LATEX> catalyst also has an MLCT absorption band centered around 495 nm. When a positive potential sufficient to oxidize the ruthenium center from <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> to <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I I } }</LATEX> is applied to the film, this feature is attenuated, indicating oxidation of the ruthenium center (Figure 7b).
rhaz | Using transient absorption spectroscopy and monitoring the recovery of the MLCT absorption of the <LATEX>\mathrm { R u } ^ { \mathrm { I I } }</LATEX> complex, the interfacial ET and PCET reaction kinetics were quantified from pH 0.7 to 6.8. The kinetics as a function of the applied potential for the reaction at each pH are provided in Figure 7c, and a plot of the maximum rate constant for the PCET reaction as a function of pH is shown in Figure 7d. For <LATEX>p H < 5 ,</LATEX> we observed the same behavior as in our previous study. The <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { a p p } } \left( E \right)</LATEX> curves for <LATEX>p H > 3</LATEX> are shifted toward lower potentials compared to the curve for <LATEX>p H = 0 . 7 .</LATEX> For the maximum rate constant, the value at <LATEX>p H = 3 . 1 0</LATEX> is similar to that at <LATEX>p H = 0 . 7 ,</LATEX> and a weak decrease is observed in the <LATEX>p H</LATEX> range of 3-5. On the other hand, the <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { a p p } } \left( E \right)</LATEX> curves for <LATEX>p H = 6 . 6 3</LATEX> is right on top of the curve at <LATEX>p H = 5 . 8 9 ,</LATEX> indicating <LATEX>p H</LATEX> independence in this pH range. The plot of <LATEX>k _ { \mathrm { m a x } , \mathrm { a p p } }</LATEX> also levels of when <LATEX>p H > 5 .</LATEX> These experimental observations provide validation for our model prediction (Figure 5b) that the apparent maximum PCET rate constant will become pH-independent at higher
wak1 | <LATEX>p H .</LATEX> CONCLUSIONS
wtfz | In this paper, we developed a multichannel kinetic model to describe the pH dependence of PCET reactions. The apparent standard potential and apparent rate constant can be expressed as functions of the mole fractions of different forms of the reactant (i.e., the protonated and deprotonated forms), which in turn depend on pH. We derived the general expressions for the apparent rate constants of both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions and the specific expressions corresponding to Butler-Volmer and Marcus-Gerischer kinetics. The power of this model is that the multiple competing channels encompass both sequential and concerted mechanisms and, in contrast to common square schemes, the possibility of more than one proton donor and acceptor.
qy1i | We also applied this model to the light-initiated electro- chemical reduction of an ITO-attached Ru-based water oxidation catalyst and explained the experimentally observed weak pH dependence of the maximum rate constant for <LATEX>p H</LATEX> between 1 and 5. Our analysis indicates that the hydronium ion is not directly involved in a concerted PCET reaction involving proton transfer from the hydronium to a hydroxide axial ligand upon reduction of the ruthenium center. Instead, our analysis suggests that the dominant channels are either ET, where the axial ligand is water, or PCET via an ETPT mechanism, where reduction of the ruthenium is followed quickly by protonation of the hydroxide axial ligand. At low pH, the dominant channel is ET, whereas at higher pH, the mechanism becomes PCET via the ETPT mechanism. The observed pH dependence arises from the intrinsic difference between the rate constants of these two channels and the dependence of their relative contributions, as determined by the reactant mole fractions, on pH. Our model also predicts that the maximum rate constant will become pH-independent at higher pH. This prediction was confirmed by our experiments for this water oxidation catalyst attached to ITO

5bjs | by siloxane anchor groups, where the maximum rate constant is clearly pH-independent at pH > 5.
uodj | Although this specific model is consistent with the experimental data and its prediction was validated, we cannot rule out the possibility that other models might yield similar results. In particular, the assumption of a potential-dependent pKa,Ox has not been verified on an ITO surface. In addition, our calculations assumed that the rate constants can be described by MG theory and that the electronic coupling is the same for the ET2, EPT1, and EPT2 channels. The association equilibrium constants and reorganization energies were computed with DFT methods that also introduce some assumptions. As further experimental data become available, we will refine the assumptions used to determine the fundamental quantities as well as further test the model itself.
k16v | This general multichannel model for describing the kinetics of both homogeneous and electrochemical PCET reactions will have widespread applications. For each system, all relevant reaction channels must be identified. Then, a combination of computational and experimental data can be used to determine the various equilibrium constants and intrinsic rate constants or, in some cases, reasonable ranges for them. Within the framework of this multichannel model, analysis of the dominant forms of the redox species and the dominant channels as a function of pH will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of PCET reactions.
