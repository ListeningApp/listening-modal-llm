You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

d52l | Cavities 2 and 3 are linked, but are only connected with cavity 1, which is next to the diiron active site, when MMOB is bound to MMOH.54,55 A number of crystal structures with bound xenon, halogenated alkanes, and product alcohols have been obtained (Table 1). The substrate analogues dibromomethane, iodoethane, and xenon bind in cavities 2 and 3.56 Along with methanol and ethanol, the product analogues 2-bromoethanol, 3-chloropropanol, and 3-bromobutenol bind in cavities 1-3 and can bridge the diiron center, replacing a bound water molecule (Figure 6B).34,57 These structures are consistent with optical, resonance Raman, magnetic circular dichroism, electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), and EPR spectroscopic data showing that substrates and products can affect the diiron site. ,58-62 However, recent time-resolved resonance Raman data indicate that the product alcohol does not bind directly to the diiron center.º Access to the active site cavity (cavity 1) from cavities 2 and 3 is mediated by conformational changes in two residues, Leu110 and Phe188, which form a gate.3, 53,54 The functional relevance of this chain of cavities to the catalytic cycle remains controversial, however. Finally, an ~10 Å long hydrophilic pathway called the pore region is present and may

hy0l | Particulate MMO. Because of difficulties isolating stable and active purified samples of pMMO, the enzyme kinetics have not been investigated thoroughly. Assays are further complicated by the use of different reductants, including NADH and duroquinol for isolated membranes, duroquinol for purified pMMO,8 and formate for whole cells.48 For isolated M. capsulatus (Bath) membranes, of which pMMO is the main component (such preparations are referred to as membrane- bound pMMO and can sometimes be crystallized upon solubilization without further purification25), methane oxida- tion activities are in the range of 25-130 nmol min-1 mg , depending on the preparation and reductant.20 Assuming that these samples are 80% pMMO, a turnover number in the range of 3-16 min-1 can be estimated (Table 2). For propylene, membrane-bound pMMO activities are 16-123 nmol min-1 mg , giving an estimated turnover number of 2-15 min-1. For purified M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO, specific activities of 17-160 nmol min-1 mg 1 for propylene have been reported,10 corresponding to turnover numbers of 0.17-16 min-1. Lower activities of 2-23 nmol min-1 mg 1 have been obtained for membrane-bound pMMO samples from M. trichosporium OB3b, Methylocystis sp. str. M, and Methylocystis sp. str. Rockwell, with very little activity after solubilization and purification.9,26 The whole cell M. trichosporium OB3b pMMO Vmax is 82-300 nmol min-1 mg 1 total protein (measured by methane consumption),60 which corresponds to a turnover number of 30-150 min-1, assuming 20% of the total protein is pMMO.67 Similar Vmax values were measured by propylene epoxidation for whole cells of M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO.12,67,68 Thus, preserving pMMO activity upon removal from the membranes remains an important issue. Apparent pMMO Km values for methane have been reported in the range of 1-62 MM.66,69,70 Notably, some methanotrophs, including Methylocystis sp. strain SC2, can produce a high affinity pMMO with a much lower apparent Km for methane.70 The molecular basis for this enhanced methane affinity is not known.
4jmz | pMMO has a much narrower substrate range than sMMO and can oxidize only C1-C5 n-alkanes and terminal alkenes to 2-alcohols and 1,2-epoxides.48,71-73 Analysis of the pMMO structures reveals a cavity at the proposed dicopper active site as well as a second cavity extending to the zinc binding site.19,74 However, the functional relevance of these cavities remains unclear due to the moderate resolution of the pMMO structures and the lack of structures in the presence of substrates and products or analogues thereof. A hydrophobic pocket the size of pentane in the pmoA subunit has also been identified computationally75 but is not near any of crystallo- graphically observed metal binding sites. The narrow substrate specificity of pMMO and its ability to selectively orient substrates to produce (R)-alcohols72,76 suggests that a fairly restricted cavity must be present at the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the Mycobacterium NBB4 HMO suggest that residue Ala 151, which is equivalent to pmoC Asp166 in M. capsulatus (Bath) pMMO, is important for determining substrate specificity.40 This residue lies at the interface of pmoB and pmoC, about 8 Å from the dicopper center, and could modulate the sizes of the aforementioned cavities. Notably, AMO has a much broader substrate specificity,6 but there are no crystal structures of AMO, and the molecular basis for this difference remains unclear.
