You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

68xu | Methanol Derivatization. The alcohol products produced by MMOH were first derivatized by the Schotten-Baumann procedure (Loudon, 1988). The reaction solution following the single turnover was added to CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and then esterified using 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride (2 mmol), N,N- dimethylaniline (2 mmol), and NaOH (2 mmol). The mixture was stirred for 17 h at room temperature. The organic layer was washed with 3 x 100 mL of HCI (1.0 M) followed by 3 x 100 mL of 5% NaHCO3-2 M NaCl, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in 2.0 mL of CH2Cl2. Thin- layer chromatography using silica gel plates and CHCl3 as the mobile phase allowed separation of the methyl ester product at an Rf of 0.5-0.7. The area containing the product was scraped off and eluted with CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 was evaporated to a minimal amount and the product was analyzed by mass spectrometry.
hd35 | Mass Spectrometric Analysis. GC-MS was performed by using a Carlo-Erba gas chromatograph with a capillary DB-5 column, with direct injection into a Kratos MS-25 spectrometer. The retention times were determined using authentic material. The mass spectrometer was set to an ionization potential of 70 eV and selectively measured the molecular ion. Differential deuteration of the derivatized product resulted in partial separation of the two products on the GC column, necessitating the summing of multiple mass measurements (approximately 15) as the products eluted off the GC column. Each sample was analyzed in this way four times and the numbers were averaged. The isotope effect was calculated from the ratio of the products formed by H and D abstraction. Statistical factors were used when necessary to correct for different amounts of H and D of the substrate isotopic homologs.
2zpk | Steady State Kinetic Experiments. The reaction rates were monitored by measuring the rates of oxygen consumption using a Clark-type oxygen electrode fitted to a reaction chamber sealed with a very small bore (<0.5 mm) glass stopcock to minimize the flux into and out of the reaction chamber. In all cases, the initial oxygen concentration was 250 uM. The methane concentration was varied from 10 uM to 1.2 mM by making appropriate additions of methane- saturated buffer to the reaction vessel. The total volume was held constant by the addition of nitrogen-saturated buffer. The concentrations of MMOH, MMOB, MMOR, and NADH were 370 nM, 925 nM, 375 nM, and 250 uM, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 uL of NADH solution and repeated 2-3 times for each of 10 different substrate concentrations. The buffer and temperature were the same as for the transient kinetic experiments, 100 mM MOPS, pH 7.7, at 4 °C.
epu7 | RESULTS
7od1 | Rate of Compound Q Decay in the Presence of Deuterated Methanes. Compound Q formation and decay rates are easily determined by monitoring a single-turnover reaction at 430 nm using stopped-flow kinetic techniques and analyzing the data as described in Experimental Procedures. The rate of decay of compound Q is strongly dependent on the type and concentration of substrate present. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the compound Q decay rate constant on CH4 and CD4 concentrations. Each substrate caused a linear increase in the pseudo-first-order rate constant with increas- ing methane concentration. The slope of each line shown in Figure 2 gives the second-order rate constant for the reaction. Remarkably, the second-order rate constant for the CH4 reaction is ~100 times greater3 than that for the CD4 reaction, indicative of an exceptionally large KIE. In contrast, no significant KIE or substrate concentration dependence was observed for the compound Q formation reaction.
0bqy | The decay reactions were examined for artifacts that could lead to an apparent large isotope effect. Mixtures of CH4 and CD4 caused compound Q to decay in a single-exponential

ccmb | phase at the rate expected for the CH4 concentration present (Figure 2). This demonstrates that the CD4 samples used did not contain an inhibitor for the reaction and reinforces the observation that CD4 is essentially unreactive compared to CH4. Also, it shows that the methane is in rapid equilibrium between the enzyme and the solvent, so that binding of the methane to (or collision with) the enzyme does not necessarily commit the reaction to completion.
ma93 | The same experiment was carried out with mono-, di-, and trideuterated methanes with the second-order decay rate constants shown in Figure 3. The observed second-order rate constant decreases linearly with the extent of deuteration. Thus, the <LATEX>\mathrm { C } - \mathrm { D }</LATEX> bonds appear to be nearly inert to oxygen insertion in comparison with the C-H bonds.
c6hh | Temperature Dependence of Compound <LATEX>Q</LATEX> Decay in the Presence of Methane. The activation energies and Arrhenius preexponential factors were measured for the reactions between compound <LATEX>\mathrm { Q }</LATEX> and CH4 and <LATEX>C D _ { 4 } .</LATEX> Since the reaction becomes very fast as the temperature is increased, the temperature range was limited from 1.8 to 7 ℃ for <LATEX>\mathrm { C H } _ { 4 }</LATEX> and from 2.5 to 16 ℃ for <LATEX>\mathrm { C D } _ { 4 } ,</LATEX> when each was present at 300 uM (Figure 4). The <LATEX>H</LATEX> and D activation energies are 22.4 and 24.5 kcal/mol, respectively, giving a difference of 2.1 kcal/mol with an overall error of <LATEX>\pm 1 0 \% .</LATEX> The apparent Arrhenius preexponential factor ratio (H:D) is <LATEX>\sim 0 . 9 6</LATEX> (data not shown). The formation reactions showed the same activation energies (37.3 kcal/mol) and preexponential factors within experimental error.
y7ea | Effect of Methane Deuteration on Product Ratio from Compound Q Decay. The methanol produced from a single turnover of diferrous MMOH was readily analyzed by GC- MS following derivatization as described in Experimental Procedures. Analysis of the results was simplified in some cases by the use of 18O2 in the oxygenation reaction, which served to shift the product mass by 2 units, so that it became distinct from the trace amounts of derivatized methanol originating from the extraction solvent. When <LATEX>C D _ { 4 }</LATEX> and 1802 were used as the substrates the only product was CD318OH, showing that no exchange of oxygen or methyl hydrogens occurred. The results for the isotopic methane homologs

The product ratios clearly reveal a large deuterium isotope effect in all cases. However, the intramolecular deuterium isotope effect is in the range of <LATEX>4 - 1 3</LATEX> rather than 50-100, as observed for compound Q decay rates. The largest value observed was 19.3 for the intermolecular isotope effect for a 1:1 mixture of <LATEX>C H 4</LATEX> and
