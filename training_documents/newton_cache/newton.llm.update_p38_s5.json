Note that, in this case, A of x sub k, delta equals A of x star, zero by Lemma E point one and alpha sub k in the range bar alpha, one where\n8h0u | bar alpha defined as min of one, two times one minus rho times mu over L sub g, delta over norm p sub k superscript I. Equation forty-eight\nb09f | by Lemma E point two. It is also clear that MINRES selects D sub t w e equals SOL. We first show that the step size, alpha sub k, can be uniformly lower bounded for x sub k close enough to X star. We do this by showing that the step norm p sub k superscript I can be upper bounded. Specifically, due to forty-six, the step, p sub k superscript I, is upper bounded by the gradient magnitude (compare with\nzutp | rho equals mu) norm p sub k superscript I is less than or equal to norm g sub k superscript I over mu. Equation forty-nine\nqgmy | Next we use the continuity of nabla f of x and the fact that g star superscript I of x star, zero equals zero to choose Delta sub zero less than or equal to min of Delta sub s e p, Delta sub c v x such that x sub k in B of x star, Delta sub zero implies\n40wi | norm g sub k superscript I of x sub k, delta equals norm g sub k superscript I of x star, zero less than or equal to mu delta over two, where in the first equality we used Lemma E point one. This implies\na418 | norm p sub k superscript I less than or equal to delta over two. Equation fifty\ne9lu | and hence by forty-eight\na278 | bar alpha defined as min of one, two times one minus rho times mu over L sub q. We now show that A of x star, zero is a subset of A of x sub k plus one, zero. Let i in A of x star, zero. Define e sub k as x sub k minus x star. By Assumption three point eleven and the continuity of nabla f of x, there exists Delta sub one such that, for\nffto | norm e sub k less than or equal to Delta sub one, g of x sub k raised to the power j equals g of x star plus e sub k raised to the power j greater than gamma over two, for all j in A of x star, zero. Consider Delta sub two equals min of Delta sub zero, Delta sub one, bar alpha gamma over two. If x sub k in B of x star, Delta sub two, we have\nak21 | x sub k raised to the power i equals x sub k raised to the power i minus x star raised to the power i less than Delta sub two less than or equal to bar alpha gamma over two.
