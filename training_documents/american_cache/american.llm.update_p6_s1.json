        "content": "qb7o | More moderate linguists such as John Witherspoon, the teacher of James Madison, deplored the lack of federal English. He encouraged the incorporation of \"Americanisms,\" advising his students to compile new dictionaries. The most prominent compiler and reformer of the English language was Noah Webster, who initially began his reform efforts by concentrating on the received standards of English pronunciation. Using the linguistic theory that written words follow the ear, he demanded that common schools adopt a new orthography in which alphabetic letters functioned like modern phonetic signs. To illustrate his argument, for example, he wrote, \"There is no alternativ.\"\noae5 | In Webster's seventeen eighty-three primer, A Grammatical Institute of the English Language, his first successful publication in a series of spelling books, the alphabet lesson combined the pedagogic elements of reading and elocution manuals. Its directions maintained that \"a child be taught, first the Roman letters, both small and great-then the Italics-then the sounds of the vowels.\" The various spelling exercises depended on a pronouncing-form method, which meant that students learned to cipher and spell the written word through the imitation of the stresses, breaks, and pauses that marked the word's spoken performance. Moreover, because these lessons in pronunciation required students to stand up as a group, the early national spelling exercises resembled a choral performance. Each of Webster's spelling lessons entailed a graduated theatrical element: students recited numerous tables that progressed from syllabic fragments\ns0fl | (table one: \"ba, be, bi, bo . . . \"), to monosyllabic words, to the polysyllabic (table two: \"bag, big, bog . . . \"; table six: \"ab so lute, ab sti nence . . . \"), until they finally rehearsed short didactic narratives (table forty-two: \"The Story of Tommy and Harry\").\n43ia | In order to give the American language its own \"sound\" (and make it at the same time the basis of a new language), Webster focused on the oral component of the elementary spelling lessons and marshaled most of his pedagogic efforts toward introducing a national \"standard of pronunciation.\" \"Such a standard,\" Webster claimed, \"universally used in schools, would in time, demolish those odious distinctions of provincial dialects, which are the objects of reciprocal ridicule in the United States.\" Webster, a staunch Federalist and ardent proponent of the union, hoped to mitigate political tensions by erasing local linguistic differences. Indeed, the expressed hope of the Grammatical Institute was that standardized pronunciation, not so much alphabetic orthography, would mediate among a regionally and socially differentiated people. If Americans would only adopt his reformed speller, Webster believed, \"all persons, of every rank, would speak with some degree of precision and uniformity. Such a uniformity in these states is very desirable; it would remove prejudice, and conciliate mutual affection and respect.\"\n3g2y | By concentrating on pronunciation rather than orthography, Webster sidestepped the fact that he was still using the English language to create the proposed American variant. He acknowledged that English was a fickle instrument for creating a national community. He predicted that, even if there were an American English language, the new citizen \"will claim a right to pronounce most agreeably to his own fancy, and the language will be exposed to perpetual fluctuation.\" Webster's reform plan seemed already defeated, for he must negotiate the inherent flexibility underlying all languages, the fact that linguistic forms do not always follow rules but evolve constantly and are shaped by individual oral applications, local habits, and social settings.\ngc7v | Webster resolved this dilemma by turning to the discourse of geography, in particular the spelling of place-names. He assured his readers that a geographical lexicon could overcome local differences. Commenting in the Grammatical Institute, Webster writes that \"the advantage of publishing, in a work of this kind, the names of the United States, the counties in each, etc. will not be disputed by any American.\" Thus, while the opacity surrounding the English language was fueling the regionally motivated debates over the proper wording of the Republic's basic document, Webster imagined that the \"undisputed\" pronunciation of geographical words could provide a sense of clarity and a practical code when imagining a unified community.\nwqfv | The assertion that the consensual pronunciation of geographic place-names was the nation's neutral linguistic ground provided Webster with a formula through which he simultaneously decolonized and nationalized his speller. Webster's self-assigned challenge was to displace the British schoolbook A New Guide to the English Language, by Thomas Dilworth, a speller that had dominated the classrooms and homes of British Ameri-",
