        "content": "tv7p | Parameters are related to the Data sources through the use of calculated fields, which can be complicated to maintain\niube | In the next few exercises, we will accomplish several tasks via the creation of three parameters. We will create parameters that integrate with calculated fields to:\ne033 | Show a single year in one graph and a range of years in another graph\ny8m6 | Filter across multiple Data sources\n4595 | Allow users to select the detail that needs to be explored\nzjlt | There are a couple of key concepts about parameters that you should keep in mind as we go through this chapter:\nsxhf | One. Each parameter is unique to a workbook and not to a Data source.\nqnrk | Two. You can copy parameters from one workbook to another without issues because they are not dependent on data sources.\nnps9 | Each parameter has a name, data type, format, and value.\nt0gb | \nfep0 | Chapter Eight\nmjuh | The first task that we need to accomplish by creating a parameter involves using a Year filter for the dashboard. Two of the visualizations, namely the map and the line graph, have a Time dimension. We want to create a filter from which users can select the year. When a user selects a year, the map will be filtered to show only that year, but the line graph will show five years on either side of the dashboard.\n7go1 | In order to build this functionality, we will need to create three new elements. The descriptions of these elements are as follows:\nclrl | The Year parameter. This has a data type of INT and a range of values\nulg7 | A Calculated field. This will be used as a filter on the map so that the year that we are showing in the map matches the selection from the parameter\nai6n | A Second Calculated field. This will be used as a filter on the line graph that allows five years on either side of the selected year\nr85f | Let's create a Year parameter by performing the following steps:\n809c | One. Create a new parameter by clicking on the Context menu in the Data window or by right-clicking on the white space in the Data window and selecting Create Parameter.\n88wb | Two. Give the parameter a name that represents what you want users to do. Ensure that the name does not match any of the field names in your data source. Otherwise, this will cause issues.\ncos6 | Three. We named our parameter Select a Year.\nd7mf | Four. Select the data type of the parameter. When you are using a parameter in a Calculated field, you can convert it to different types. We want ours to be a string because Year is a string field in the Data source.\nswxw | Five. If we had selected a different type of field, we would have had to format it accordingly. One of the reasons why we left it as a string is that we won't be running the risk of displaying improperly formatted values.\n21z8 | Six. Select List for the Allowable values, as shown in the following screenshot:\njoel | Seven. You have the option of populating the list from your own list of values or from one of the fields in either of the two Data sources.\nikdv | \nmsiy | The parameter lists are not updated dynamically from the fields.\ny8pn | \nbrx4 | Eight. Click on the Add from Field button and then select the Year field.\n6o0i | \n9i2l | You only see fields of the same data type as a parameter. If there were multiple data sources in the workbook, you would see the others as well.\njkgo | Chapter Eight\nkeob | Nine. Now, the list of values matches that of the source field from the Data source. But from the bottom of the list of values, remove the years after two thousand eight because the data collected for these years is not complete. You can do this by hovering the pointer of the mouse over the row and clicking on the X that appears to the right of a values, as shown in the following screenshot:\n6xew | Ten. Also, keep in mind that Tableau is case-sensitive, which means that the contents of the parameter list must match the contents of the field list.\nhmbg | Eleven. The final parameter has been set to a default of two thousand eight, as shown in the following screenshot:\na82c | Using parameters as Filters\nu2j3 | You now have a parameter that you can use to filter certain fields. In the following steps, we will create two new calculated fields-the first will filter the map to show only the Year selected, and the second will filter the line graph to show five years on either side of the Year selected:\ntnhu | One. On the map's worksheet, the first task is to create a new Calculated field called Map Year Filter.\nyki0 | Two. The formula is simple; it is Boolean expression, and it tells Tableau Public that we want only the Year values that map the parameter selection, as shown in the following screenshot:\nlsai | Three. Remove the filter on the Year field, which is a blue pill on the Filters shelf.\ni5g8 | Four. Drag this new field from the Dimensions pane to the Filters shelf and select True.\nhdi4 | Five. Apply this filter to the Region KPIs worksheet.\nofyw | Six. Right-click on the Select a Year parameter, which is below the Measures in the Data window, and show the parameter control.\nhzyo | Next, we will create a Calculated field for the line graph that filters to show five years on either side of the parameter.\nj7i8 | Chapter Eight\nilpe | Open the worksheet with the line graph, perform the following steps to create a Calculated field:\nulbc | One. Create a new Calculated field and name it Year Plus Minus.\n7nzf | Two. In the following screenshot, we used a formula to convert both the parameter and field to integers so that we can perform mathematical functions on them. If you want to, you can create another parameter to allow users to input the number of years that they would like to see on either side and then replace the instances of five with it:\nuuws | Three. Click on OK.\nruhe | Four. Add this new field from the Measures pane to the Filters shelf and select True. Now, we will return to the dashboard and continue making modifications. The first thing that we want to do is show the parameter.\np7y3 | Five. From the Context menu for the map worksheets on the dashboard, click on Parameters and then click on the Select a Year parameter.\nkxtt | Six. The parameter automatically appears next to the Region Quick Filter. It would look better if the two were stacked. So, add a Vertical Layout Container to the Horizontal Container with the header and filter, and then move the Filter and parameter into it.\nqdy5 | Seven. Add an extra one hundred pixels of height to the dashboard.\nwl6l | Filters and Actions\n60q4 | Modifying titles\nmwhj | We can modify the header of the dashboard to reflect the selection of a year as well. The title is hard-coded to identify carbon dioxide emissions from two thousand eight, but if we select a different year from the parameter, such as two thousand five, then we need to ensure that the title is updated.\nt8dw | We can add the parameter to the title by performing the following steps:\njmsn | One. Double-click on the title.\nxkyp | Two. Delete the hard-coded reference to two thousand eight.\nyciz | Three. Click on the Insert button.\n7zau | Four. Select the parameter that we want to add, as shown in the following screenshot:\na7jx | Since this title is actually a text object on the dashboard and not a specific worksheet title, we cannot insert field values, but we can insert parameters. It's always a good idea to make it very obvious what your user is looking at so that they don't run the risk of assuming the wrong thing.\nqnju | Filtering across multiple Data sources with parameters",
