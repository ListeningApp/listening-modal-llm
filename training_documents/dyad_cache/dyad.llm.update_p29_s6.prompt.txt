You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

g8rd | Willoughby's family background is unclear. According to his official biography, he was born in 1892 under the name Adolf Tscheppe-Weidenbach, to a German Baron from Baden and an American mother, Emma Willoughby of Baltimore, Maryland. But the German weekly Der Spiegel, which investigated his ancestry in 1950, found out that there was no registry for such a birth in 1892, and that Willoughby was probably born as an illegitimate child to a German rope maker and a German mother.24 He came to the 4 United States and became an American citizen in 1910, and the same year enlisted in the army as Adolf Charles Weidenbach-the family name of his alleged rope maker father.24 He later Americanized his name to Willoughby. It is possible, then, that Willoughby fabricated a family background and, if this indeed was the case, it fit well with certain patterns of his behavior.
nns9 | According to Willoughby's official biography, in 1914, following studies at Heidelberg, the Sorbonne, and Pennsylvania College at Gettysburg, he received his bachelor of arts degree and continued his master's studies at the University of Kansas at Lawrence. Given that he left Germany at the age of eighteen, and that students were not enlisted in Heidelberg before the age of nineteen, the validity of this account is dubious as well.245 The same year he started a military career, first as a commissioned Volunteer (Reserve) officer and, then as a career infantry officer. Between mid-1917 and late 1918 he served as an aviator (flying combat missions in France) and then returned to the Infantry. Until 1940, when he joined MacArthur's headquarters in the Philippines as a supply officer, he served, among others, as a military attaché to Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador and at various staff schools as an instructor and lecturer. He wrote a number of books on history and military studies, and built a scholarly reputation in these fields.246
9uwy | Although Willoughby adopted an American name, his Teutonic accent, his tendency to use a monocle, his natty custom-tailored uniforms, and his aloofness made him somewhat of an anomaly among his American peers. For many of his colleagues, he was the personification of "the old-school Prussian army officer,"247 "more of von Stroheim than von Rundstedt" type.248 Even within MacArthur's ultraconservative inner
srly | p. 179 circle, Willoughby 4 was noted for his pro-fascist inclination.24" He was an admirer of Fascist Spain and regarded Francisco Franco as "the second greatest military commander in the world."25 This inclination led MacArthur to call him "my lovable fascist,"251 but his more common nicknames for him were "Sir Charles" and "the count."
dl6i | MacArthur's relations with Willoughby, the only "Bataan Boy" that remained with him until the end of his military career in 1951, were complex. Willoughby admired MacArthur and saw him, even before they met, as the greatest military leader in US history. It is quite probable that his "doglike devotion" to his boss was not a product of sycophancy, as many believed, but of a sincere admiration. MacArthur, for his share, respected his G-2's intellect, shared with him a love of military history, allowed him unrestricted access, and was as "fanatically loyal" to him as he was to other officers from his inner circle.25 MacArthur trusted his G-2 with nonprofessional tasks as well. In 1944, when a group of conservative republican politicians considered nominating him to run for president against Roosevelt, Willoughby acted as the liaison between Senator Arthur Vandenberg and the general. In June, he was sent by MacArthur to Washington to discuss the issue with Vandenberg and other prominent republicans.253
89ub | When it came to Willoughby's service as MacArthur's G-2, the picture is less clear. By one testimony, MacArthur thought that he was "[t]he finest G-2 officer he had encountered in his fifty-odd years of service. "254 At the same time, in 1943, he paid almost no attention to "what Willoughby told him" and no operation was called off or mounted because of his intelligence, though, as the quality of intelligence improved in 1944, he paid it more attention.25 Probably the best definition for the relationship between the two was given by Drea, who wrote in his excellent study on MacArthur and intelligence in the Pacific war that Willoughby "served MacArthur unquestioningly, and in exchange MacArthur tolerated Willoughby's uneven intelligence appreciations throughout the Pacific War." Summing up MacArthur's attitude toward his G-2, he noted that 4 MacArthur "accepted Willoughby's loyalty but never confused it with exceptional competence."256
dhle | Willoughby's professional record after becoming MacArthur's G-2 was a mixed bag, too. Within a short period of time (June-September, 1942), he succeeded, despite having no prior experience, in building an effective intelligence system made of three sections: a geographical and terrain section that produced the necessary information for MacArthur's operations in an unfamiliar territory; a translation and interpretation section that collected and produced information from Japanese POWs; and a Humint section that was used for collection and clandestine operations.25 The Sigint unit (Central Bureau) was outside his perimeter of responsibility and was established and directed by Spencer B. Akin. Willoughby was even excluded from seeing some of its products. 258
2nib | Willoughby's record as an estimator, which is more relevant for our subject, was less bright. By Campbell's analysis, he "made nine badly flawed estimates in the Pacific War, which he later tried to cover up, whereas he was correct in only four key estimates."2" No wonder then that Willoughby's colleagues thought that he had "the best hindsight of any intelligence officer in the army," or that he was "a better historian than an intelligence officer."260
naev | While Willoughby's record as an intelligence estimator in WWII was dubious, three tendencies that he exhibited during his service are relevant to understand his mistakes in November 1950. The first was his tendency toward centralism, as evidenced by his attempts to gain organizational monopoly over the intelligence process and his practice of personally handling the process of making intelligence estimates. Shortly after becoming MacArthur's G-2, he dismissed Australian intelligence summaries (which proved to
