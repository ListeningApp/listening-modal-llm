        "content": "0x0s | This potential-dependent apparent P K sub A of the surface-attached species can also be viewed in terms of a potential-dependent work term due to bringing a proton to the interfacial region. A similar work term is necessary for the E T steps for the same physical reason and to ensure that the overall free energy of the P C E T process is independent of path. Therefore, this work term was added to all of the E T and P T steps. Including these work terms for the diagonal steps does not alter the results because they effectively cancel. These work terms are effectively accounting for nonideal behavior at the interface. The impact of the potential dependence of\n4exe | the apparent P K sub C values on the pH dependence of the apparent potential is negligible and is not expected to be experimentally observable for this system.\n0myz | Within the M G theory, the potential-dependent apparent rate constant can be expressed as\nxh3i | K superscript M G, Red left parenthesis E right parenthesis equals K sub max times one half left bracket one minus error function left parenthesis F left parenthesis E minus E superscript zero right parenthesis plus lambda divided by two square root lambda R T right parenthesis right bracket.\nsyiw | where lambda is the reorganization energy. The apparent reorganization energy can be defined as the driving force corresponding to the potential at which this rate constant reaches half its maximum value (i.e., K superscript M G, Red left parenthesis E right parenthesis divided by K sub max equals one half when F left parenthesis E superscript zero minus E right parenthesis equals lambda. Using the rate constant expression of the M G theory, Equation nine A becomes\nkg3t | K sub apparent superscript M G, Red left parenthesis E, pH right parenthesis equals the sum of K sub max, I times one half left bracket one minus error function left parenthesis F left parenthesis E minus E sub I superscript zero right parenthesis plus lambda sub I divided by two square root A sub I R T right parenthesis right bracket times chi sub O x sub I left parenthesis pH; P K sub A, O x left parenthesis E right parenthesis right parenthesis.\nlvae | We estimated the total reorganization energies for E T and E P T to be zero point thirty-seven and one point zero one electron volts, respectively, based on our previous calculations. In this previous work, the outer-sphere (solvent) reorganization energy was computed using a dielectric continuum model with a cylindrical cavity containing a point charge representing the molecular catalyst, as well as the bridge attaching it to the electrode surface. The resulting outer-sphere reorganization energy was computed to be zero point twenty-one electron volts and was assumed to be the same for E T and E P T. In this previous work, the inner-sphere (solute) reorganization energies were computed using the four-\no9sc | point method for E T fifty-two and the modified four-point method for E P T. Geometry optimizations of the oxidized and reduced forms of the molecular catalyst and single-point energy calculations of each geometry in the alternative redox state, as well as optimization of the proton position for E P T, were performed using D F T. For E T, the axial ligand is H two O in the oxidized and reduced states, whereas for E P T, the axial ligand is O H in the oxidized state and H two O in the reduced state. The inner-sphere reorganization energies were computed to be zero point sixteen and zero point fifty-four electron volts for E T and E P T, respectively. The substantial difference arises from the larger change in the distance between Ru and the oxygen of the axial ligand for E P T than for E T zero point nineteen angstroms for E P T versus zero point zero six angstroms for E T. The total reorganization energy, which is the sum of the inner- and outer-sphere components, computed for E T is in agreement with experimental measurements at low pH, where only the E T channel is accessible. The total reorganization energy for E P T is an effective value where the contributions of excited proton vibrational states are also included. A model using lambda sub E P T without considering the excited proton vibrational states is provided in the S I.\nzh03 | Using the parameter values provided and explained in Table S two, we are able to model the pH and potential dependence of the apparent P C E T rate constant, as shown in Figure five. Figure five A shows qualitatively reasonable agreement with the experimental data in this potential and pH range using Equation fifteen. The weak pH dependence of K sub max, apparent is correctly described, and the curves for pH equals three and five are shifted toward lower potentials compared to the curve for pH equals one, indicating larger apparent reorganization energies for pH equals three and five. Note that this apparent reorganization energy reflects the summation over channels in equation fifteen and thus is not as easily interpreted as in equation fourteen, as discussed further below. One source of the quantitative deviations could be the use of the error function expression in equation fifteen. In this expression, we assume that the\n1mvw | app as a function of the solution pH. The y-error bars represent one standard deviation from the average of three separate electrode measurements, while the x-error bars represent one standard deviation from the average pH recorded for the electrolyte solution both before and after the experiment for each of the three trials. The red curve was generated with the kinetic model using the parameters given in Table S three.",
