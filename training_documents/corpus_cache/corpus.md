Added value of corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: A multicenter, multinational study


## Abstract

Objective: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to treatment. Once medical therapy has failed, palliative surgeries such as vagus nerve stimulation or corpus callosotomy are considered. Although corpus callosotomy is more effective than vagus nerve stimulation as the primary neurosurgical treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome-associated drop attacks, there are limited data regarding the added value of corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of corpus callosotomy preceded by vagus nerve stimulation.

Methods: This multinational, multicenter retrospective study focuses on Lennox-Gastaut syndrome children who underwent corpus callosotomy before the age of eighteen years, following prior vagus nerve stimulation, which failed to achieve satisfactory seizure control. Collected data included epilepsy characteristics, surgical details, epilepsy outcomes, and complications. The primary outcome of this study was a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks.

Results: A total of one hundred twenty-seven cases were reviewed (eighty males). The median age at epilepsy onset was six months. The median age at vagus nerve stimulation surgery was seven years, and corpus callosotomy was performed at a median age of eleven years. The dominant seizure type was drop attacks (tonic or atonic) in one hundred two patients. Eighty-six patients underwent a single-stage complete corpus callosotomy, and forty-one an anterior callosotomy. Ten patients who did not initially have a complete corpus callosotomy underwent a second surgery for completion of corpus callosotomy due to seizure persistence. Overall, there was at least a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks and other seizures in eighty-three percent and sixty percent, respectively. Permanent morbidity occurred in one point five percent, with no mortality.

Significance: Corpus callosotomy is vital in seizure control in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in whom vagus nerve stimulation has failed. Surgical risks are low. A complete corpus callosotomy has a tendency toward better effectiveness than anterior corpus callosotomy for some seizure types.


## One INTRODUCTION

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy, presenting during the first years of life, and is very resistant to control through antiseizure medications. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome may cause generalized seizure phenotypes, and significantly impact neurodevelopmental aspects such as learning, behavior, alertness, and quality of life. Thus, seizure reduction is of utmost importance, especially in young children. Moreover, drop seizures, which occur in more than half of the patients, are a significant source of morbidity, causing severe injuries, and are among the most disabling factors in this syndrome. Many such patients require close and continuous supervision and head protection with special helmets.

Once conventional antiseizure medications have failed, palliative surgeries such as vagus nerve stimulation or corpus callosotomy should be considered. A comparison of the effectiveness and safety of corpus callosotomy and vagus nerve stimulation, which are the most common palliative surgical methods, suggests that corpus callosotomy is more effective than vagus nerve stimulation in reducing atonic seizure; there is seventy-four to eighty-five percent reduction in tonic and atonic seizures following corpus callosotomy, compared to approximately fifty-five percent reduction following vagus nerve stimulation. However, corpus callosotomy is associated with a higher rate of adverse events when compared to vagus nerve stimulation. For this reason, in many cases, physicians or family favor vagus nerve stimulation over corpus callosotomy as the primary surgical palliative treatment.

Although corpus callosotomy is more effective than vagus nerve stimulation as the primary treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome-associated drop attacks, there are limited data regarding the added value of corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation.

## Key Points

Corpus callosotomy has an added value on all seizure subtypes in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who have undergone prior vagus nerve stimulation

Complete corpus callosotomy has a tendency toward better effectiveness than anterior corpus callosotomy

Additional studies are needed to ascertain the low morbidity associated with complete callosotomy

The current study evaluates the safety of corpus callosotomy and its effectiveness for drop attacks and other seizure types following prior vagus nerve stimulation for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.


## Two MATERIALS AND METHODS

This is a multicenter, multinational, retrospective, historical cohort study. Following institutional review board approval, we retrospectively reviewed the files of all children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who underwent corpus callosotomy (complete or incomplete) following a prior vagus nerve stimulation. Seventy-one international epilepsy centers were invited to participate based on personal contacts. No institutions were excluded; twenty-seven did not respond, seventeen centers had no cases meeting the inclusion criteria, one declined participation, and twenty-six centers contributed one hundred forty-five patients (ranging from one to eighteen patients from each participating center) operated on between two thousand three and two thousand twenty-one.


## Two point one Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Children (up to eighteen years of age during corpus callosotomy surgery) undergoing corpus callosotomy surgery, who also underwent a prior vagus nerve stimulation for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, were included in the study. The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome diagnosis was based on the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy. All variations of corpus callosotomy were included (anterior, posterior, complete, open disconnections, and radiofrequency or laser ablation). All Lennox-Gastaut syndrome etiologies were included. Other epileptic syndromes (unrelated to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) and patients who underwent vagus nerve stimulation following prior corpus callosotomy were excluded.


## Two point two Collected data

Collected data included demographics, epilepsy etiology, age at seizure onset, and seizure semiology. Surgical data included any prior epilepsy-related surgery (including resections, but not including corpus callosotomy), data regarding vagus nerve stimulation surgery (including complications and effectiveness on drop seizures and other seizures), data regarding corpus callosotomy surgery (including technique, extent, complications, and effectiveness), and the need for additional surgeries.


## Two point three Study outcomes

The primary outcome was effectiveness of corpus callosotomy in reducing fifty percent of drop attacks at the last follow-up despite failure of a prior vagus nerve stimulation. Secondary outcome measures were other seizure reductions, role of extent of callosotomy, and safety.


## Two point four Statistical analysis

Data were tabulated in an Excel spreadsheet. SPSS software was used for all statistical analyses. Categorical variables are reported as numbers and percentages. Comparison between outcomes of partial and complete callosotomy was done using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables are reported as median and interquartile range. Correlation between

CC outcomes and VNS outcomes was performed using the Fisher exact text. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P is less than point zero five was considered significant.


## Three - RESULTS

Of one hundred forty-five cases submitted by twenty-six centers, one hundred twenty-seven fulfilled the inclusion criteria (zero to fifteen per center). Eighty were males, and forty-seven were females. Age at epilepsy onset was zero to one hundred twenty months (median equals six, I Q R equals three point one two to twenty two point seven five). Etiology was genetic in thirty-one, structural/congenital in seventeen, structural/acquired in fifteen, and unknown or not reported in sixty-four. Dominant seizure types included atypical absence in eight, drop attacks (tonic or atonic) in one hundred two, generalized tonic-clonic in twenty-five, and focal with impaired awareness in fifteen, in addition to the mandatory tonic seizures. Duration of experiencing drop attacks before VNS was zero to fifteen years (median equals five, I Q R equals two point five to eight). Forty-eight children were reported to have severe, thirty moderate, and twenty-two mild or borderline intellectual disability. Three children had prior resective epilepsy surgeries, and forty-five were on the ketogenic diet.


## Three point one Vagus nerve stimulation

Age at VNS surgery was three months to fifteen years (median equals seven, I Q R equals four to ten). Children were on up to six ASMs (three point one plus or minus one point one) before VNS. Apart from two patients who had their VNS setting on one point five mA, all other patients were titrated to a minimal output current of one point seventy-five mA. Seizure outcomes following VNS, and as evaluated before CC surgery (at a follow-up of up to seventeen years, median equals three point three, I Q R equals two to six), are summarized in Table one.


## Three point two Corpus callosotomy

A total of one hundred twenty-seven children underwent CC surgery at two to eighteen years (median equals eleven, I Q R equals eight point seventy-six to fifteen), up to seventeen years following VNS (median equals three point three, I Q R equals two to six). Eighty-six underwent a complete callosotomy, and forty-one an anterior callosotomy

(forty were of the anterior two-thirds, and one of half the callosum extent). We did not collect data regarding the reason for the extent of disconnection. The surgical approach for a complete CC included an open anterior interhemispheric approach (n equals eighty-four) and endoscopic (n equals two). Of the forty-one anterior CCs, thirty-eight were performed via an anterior interhemispheric approach, and three used laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT).

Ten children underwent additional CC surgery, completing the posterior disconnection. The time from first to second CC surgery was two to eighty-six months (median equals sixteen point three, I Q R equals six point seven to thirty-four point three). Surgical approaches included anterior interhemispheric in six, posterior interhemispheric in three, and LITT in one. We were therefore evaluating the results following ninety-six complete CC procedures and thirty-one partial CC procedures, with a total of one hundred thirty-seven surgical procedures. The one hundred thirty-seven procedures included an anterior interhemispheric approach (n equals one hundred twenty-eight), endoscopic (n equals two), LITT (n equals four), and posterior interhemispheric

(n equals three). Surgical complications were reported for eighteen of one hundred thirty-seven CC procedures. Following the one hundred twenty-seven primary CC procedures, complications included wound complications (four infections, two not specified), pneumonia (n equals two), neurological (a total of six cases, four transient, one pericallosal artery infarct, and one not specified), one noninfectious fever, one plate removal several years after surgery, and one general deterioration. Following the ten CC-completion procedures, only one wound infection was reported.


## Three point three. Follow-up and seizure outcome

Follow-up after the primary corpus callosotomy was two to one hundred ninety-one months (median equals forty-two point four, IQR equals sixteen to eighty-five). The number of anti-seizure medications at the last follow-up after the primary corpus callosotomy procedure was similar to that prior to corpus callosotomy (three point three plus minus one point three after versus three point three point one point two before corpus callosotomy). Seizure outcomes are presented in Table two. Overall, eighty-three percent had at least a fifty percent reduction in drop attacks, and a sixty percent

Note: Percentages are given of reported cases only.

reduction in other seizures. Comparing the outcomes between anterior callosotomy and complete callosotomy (including a one or two stage complete callosotomy), extent of disconnection did not significantly affect drop attack control (considering a fifty percent and an eighty percent cutoff, and using the chi-squared test). For "other seizure types," a complete callosotomy was significantly associated with a better outcome when compared to anterior callosotomy using the fifty percent cutoff (P equals point zero one three) but not using the eighty percent cutoff.

Outcomes of drop attack control following corpus callosotomy were compared to vagus nerve stimulation outcomes according to degree of seizure reduction categories: less than fifty percent, between fifty percent and eighty percent, and greater than eighty percent. To verify that sufficient time had elapsed since placing vagus nerve stimulation, we focused on patients with one to two-year follow-up after vagus nerve stimulation (prior to corpus callosotomy, N equals twenty-seven), and patients with greater than two years follow-up after vagus nerve stimulation (prior to corpus callosotomy, N equals sixty). Using the Fisher exact test, the degree of drop attack reduction following corpus callosotomy was not significantly correlated to the degree of reduction after vagus nerve stimulation (P equals point six seven six for one to two years, and P equals point two six six for greater than two years following the vagus nerve stimulation before corpus callosotomy).

In addition to the ten cases undergoing completion of the posterior corpus callosotomy, ten patients underwent additional surgeries: frontal lobectomy (N equals one), responsive neurostimulation system concurrently with the completion of corpus callosotomy (N equals one), and deep brain stimulation to the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (N equals eight, three of which had a responsive neurostimulation system to the centromedian nucleus).


## Four. DISCUSSION

We report here that in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who fail to achieve seizure control after vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callosotomy has an added value, significantly improving seizure control. This is true for drop (tonic and atonic) seizures and other seizure phenotypes. Corpus callosotomy-related morbidity was low, and complete corpus callosotomy was associated with higher seizure reduction rates than partial corpus callosotomy.

Prior studies have reported the greater value of corpus callosotomy over vagus nerve stimulation as a primary treatment for children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,

especially for atonic seizures. However, other studies have found similar effectiveness for both treatments. Additionally, vagus nerve stimulation seems more cost-effective one year after surgery and is associated with fewer complications. However, this study did not evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness (considering the need for vagus nerve stimulation battery replacement), which may prove corpus callosotomy is more cost-effective. When both options (corpus callosotomy and vagus nerve stimulation) are available, many families will opt for vagus nerve stimulation first. Reasons include avoidance of brain surgery, especially because the treatment is palliative and not curative. This is based mainly on the fear of callosotomy-associated risks, including vascular injury, supplementary motor area syndrome, akinetic mutism, disconnection syndrome, and other risks (infection, hydrocephalus, wound-related, and others).

Data are limited regarding secondary treatments (corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation or vagus nerve stimulation following corpus callosotomy). Hong et al. reported that half of the patients who underwent corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation reported greater than fifty percent seizure reduction, with seven of nine patients experiencing total elimination of drop seizures. Guillamon et al. reported a small case series of three patients treated with corpus callosotomy following vagus nerve stimulation in severe drug-resistant epilepsy. They reported up to ninety-eight percent decrease in total seizure frequency following corpus callosotomy. In another small series of seven cases, Arya et al. reported all patients were free of drop attacks, with a thirty-four point seven percent decrease in total daily seizure frequency at a mean follow-up of two point six years. The results of the current series concur with these publications, with approximately eighty percent having greater than fifty percent reduction in drop attacks, and sixty percent having greater than fifty percent reduction in other seizure types.

Katagiri et al. evaluated ten children who underwent vagus nerve stimulation following failed corpus callosotomy, the reverse of our approach. Six of ten (sixty percent) patients had greater than or equal to fifty percent seizure reduction for all residual seizure types after vagus nerve stimulation, and seventy-seven point eight percent showed total resolution of drop seizures.

Corpus callosotomy may be performed via various approaches, including interhemispheric, endoscopic-assisted (also done via the interhemispheric route), and laser interstitial thermal therapy. Laser interstitial thermal therapy approach is minimally invasive, associated with shorter hospitalization and fewer complications, and has similar outcomes to the open approaches. However, laser interstitial thermal therapy is not widely available, and may not be suitable for all corpus callosal anatomy. Open corpus callosotomy, on the other hand, is a widely performed surgery. The microsurgical technique is common to other commonly performed procedures, and is associated with low morbidity if done by experienced surgeons.

There is a long-lasting debate regarding the optimal extent of callosotomy between anterior, complete, and posterior callosotomy. The basis for this debate is the potential for disconnection syndrome. However, most children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have profound intellectual disability at baseline, and the balance between seizure control (with its positive impact on the quality of life) and the risk of potential disconnection syndrome often favor the goal of seizure control.

This study aim was not to compare corpus callosotomy to vagus nerve stimulation as a primary treatment, but to show that vagus nerve stimulation failure does not predict the failure of corpus callosotomy, and that corpus callosotomy as the secondary treatment can have a significant benefit.

Interestingly, the outcomes of our series (of secondary CC) concur with the results of primary CC. The reasons for the VNS-CC dissonance and added value of CC are unknown but likely involve their different mechanisms of action. Cukiert et al. noted a postsurgical disruption of secondary bilateral synchrony seen on electroencephalographic recording in eighty-five percent of CC patients, with no EEG modification after VNS insertion. CC disrupts the bilateral synchrony of the hemispheres, whereas the exact mechanisms of VNS are not entirely understood. Based on animal models, it has multiple possible mechanisms of actions, among which is a suppression of cortical hypersynchronization by modulating the synaptic network. Other recent data suggest that VNS affects neural networks in three domains: brainstem, limbic system, and cortex. The importance of frequency and amplitude of stimulation on the VNS effect was stated as well. Nevertheless, it should be noted that over time, shorter epilepsy duration and longer VNS therapy time indicted a higher response likelihood, rather than dosing setting. The direct disconnection (achieved with a CC) shows immediate and more effective results. This network disruption not only reduces the general activity associated with drop attacks, but it also reduces other seizures through as yet unknown mechanisms.

This study has several limitations, mainly its retrospective multicenter nature, as well as the lack of a standardized evaluation time point. The lack of a unified time point for outcome evaluation may bias the results. As each center reported data, we could not centrally verify the data, nor verify whether LGS-like cases were included. Detailed neurocognitive assessment was not possible. Disconnection syndrome could not be confirmed in our patients. We did not include EEG data before or following surgery. Thus, the diagnosis of LGS and the effect of surgery on EEG could not be centrally verified. The epilepsy status was based on parental reports during follow-up visits, and the information was incomplete for some patients. The accuracy of seizure detection by parental notification is limited, especially among children, and a possible bias to report better results following surgery cannot be excluded. Reports on seizure outcomes, as well as on the number of ASMs, were not complete. Thus, a bias toward better seizure control cannot be excluded. We did not include dosages of ASM or change to different drugs, possibly affecting seizure outcome. Some of the patients had a VNS battery change after CC, perhaps contributing to better seizure control, mood, and overall quality of life. We did not collect data regarding the need for VNS battery change, or avoidance of replacement when it was needed.

Despite these limitations, these children were treated for several years with various ASMs. Parents were aware of the seizure semiology; thus, although potentially inaccurate, their report of seizure reduction most likely reflects an actual decline.


## Five CONCLUSIONS

CC has a significant added value in controlling seizures in children with LGS who had prior VNS. Callosotomy resulted in better seizure control considering a greater than fifty cutoff for drop attacks and other seizure types. CC was associated with a low complication rate. Complete callosotomy resulted in better seizure control compared to anterior callosotomy considering a greater than fifty cutoff for other seizure types.
