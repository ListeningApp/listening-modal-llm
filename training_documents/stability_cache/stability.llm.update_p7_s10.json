Most notably, a larger number of children from the internalizing and externalizing subgroups in early or late childhood transitioned to the no problems group over time, suggesting that for many children symptoms of psychopathology during childhood are a transient phase of development. The differences in homotypic continuity might reflect actual differences between the samples used, but are also likely to be partially dependent on the differences in how psychopathology is reported on the CBCL used here and the Development and Wellbeing Assessment used in earlier work. Whereas the CBCL is a continuous measure of psychopathology, the Development and Wellbeing Assessment is a structured\nko3c | clinical interview to diagnose psychopathology. Because of our use of continuous measures, the internalizing and externalizing subgroup consists of children with mostly subclinical symptoms. Possibly, homotypic continuity is higher for those with clinical diagnoses than for those with subclinical symptoms. It would thus be interesting to study whether the initial level of symptoms is predictive of the likelihood that children have persistent problems in a sample enriched for children with subclinical and clinical levels of psychopathology.\nxek3 | Consistent with earlier literature and the conceptualization of the dysregulation profile, we found that the prevalence of the dysregulation profile is highest in late childhood, after which there is a decline into adolescence. Regarding the development of dysregulation profile symptoms, we show that those children who already exhibit internalizing or externalizing symptoms are most likely to transition to the dysregulation profile. However, similar to earlier work, and in line with decreasing prevalence of the dysregulation profile with age, few children transition to the dysregulation profile after late childhood. Those who are in the dysregulation profile in early adolescence largely originated from the externalizing and dysregulation profile subgroups. Notably, the homotypic continuity of the dysregulation profile decreases between late childhood and early adolescence. Together with the decrease in prevalence, this implies that, for most individuals, psychopathology becomes more clustered within the internalizing or externalizing domain. Despite this decrease in homotypic continuity, our results support the evidence that the dysregulation profile is an at-risk state for persistent psychopathology, in which the risk of persistence increases with the age at which the dysregulation profile is exhibited. Where between early and late childhood, twenty-three percent of those children that are in the dysregulation profile transitioned to the no problems group, only nine percent of children in the dysregulation profile transitioned to the no problems group between late childhood and early adolescence. Thus, children exhibiting dysregulation profile symptoms in late childhood are an optimal target for future intervention studies, as those children are likely to benefit most from early treatment.\nbbpr | The strengths of our study include the large sample size and the longitudinal design embedded within a population-based cohort. Moreover, using data-driven approaches, namely latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis, we were able to separately measure psychopathology in a more integrated way, compared to assessing individual traits that are likely correlated. Despite these strengths, this study should be considered in light of some limitations. First, we included parental report of child behavior only, other informants (self-report, teacher report) may provide other valuable insights into the development of childhood psychopathology. Unfortunately, we do not have parallel repeated measures of other informants. Second, at time one, the CBCL version one point five to five was used, where for those that were older than five years of age at assessment, the CBCL version six to eighteen would have been more appropriate. At the time of data-collection the decision to use the version one point five to five was\n5zyf | made to maintain consistency with earlier waves of data-collection not included in the current study. Third, at time two, fit indices provided almost equal support for a four and five profile fit. However, after visual inspection of the profiles that emerged from our latent profile analysis with five subgroups, the additional subgroup seemed to be a mix of children with internalizing problems and children with the dysregulation profile. This was further supported by the results that we obtained from rerunning the latent transition analysis with five profiles at time two. Most children that were included in the additional fifth profile transitioned to either the internalizing subgroup or the dysregulation profile at time three.\n9own | We present both the prevalence and characteristics of psychopathology subgroups and the stability and change that children exhibit in their behavioral development across childhood and adolescence in a large, longitudinal population-based study. Our findings suggest that for many children, internalizing and externalizing problems can be considered a transient phase of development, but that for externalizing problems the predictive value of persistent problems increases with age. Children classified in the dysregulation profile in late childhood are much more likely to have psychopathology later and the divergence to more specific patterns of psychopathology begins in early adolescence.\nbqfb | Summary\nwwdt | In summary, we assessed both the stability and nature of change in symptoms of psychopathology from childhood into early adolescence. Using data-driven methods, latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis, we estimated psychopathology subgroups and the transition probabilities between the different psychopathology subgroups and the no problems subgroup. Similar to earlier work both within our sample and in other samples, we identified four behavioral subgroups; including 'no problems' (time one: eighty-five point nine percent, time two: seventy-nine point zero percent, time three: seventy-eight point zero percent), 'internalizing' (time one: five point one percent, time two: nine point two percent, time three: nine point zero percent), 'externalizing' (time one: seven point three percent, time two: eight point three percent, time three: ten point two percent) and a 'dysregulation' profile (time one: one point seven percent, time two: three point five percent, time three: two point eight percent). Many children who were classified in the internalizing and externalizing subgroup transitioned to the no problems subgroup later in development. However, those classified in the dysregulation profile in late childhood were likely to have persistent psychopathology, with ninety-one point four percent being in either the internalizing, externalizing or dysregulation profile subgroup in early adolescence. This supports evidence that, for some children, internalizing and externalizing problems can be a transient phase of development, whereas the dysregulation profile is a severe at-risk state for persistent psychopathology.\nmn1r | Data Availability Generation R data is available to researchers upon reasonable request.
