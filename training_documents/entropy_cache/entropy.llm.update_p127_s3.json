This makes it a bit easier to handle systems with a countable infinity of states. In the following puzzles, which are only for the most devoted readers, let's use these ideas to prove and improve the Third Law for systems with countably many states.\n0kr1 | Earlier we worked with temperature, but it's cooler to use coolness. For all the following puzzles, let's suppose we have a system with a countable infinity of states n equals one, two, three, and so on with energies En. Also suppose thermal equilibrium is possible for some Bo greater than zero, i.e., the sum\n58mo | Z of Bo equals the sum of exp of negative BoEn from n equals one to infinity\n1ghh | converges. Our arguments also apply to systems with finitely many states, where this convergence condition is automatic.\n643d | En equals En plus c\n58a9 | we get a new 'shifted' system whose partition function, expected energy, free energy, and entropy are related to those of our original system by\nhjlr | Z equals exp of negative ßc times Z, the expected value of E equals the expected value of E plus c, F equals F plus c, and S equals S\n0k3o | for all B greater than Bo.\na1r1 | Now further suppose that our original system has just one state of least energy. Earlier we saw that we could reindex the states so that E one is less than E two is less than or equal to E three is less than or equal to and so on and En approaches positive infinity. The same is true of our new shifted system, and let's choose c equals negative E one so that the lowest energy of the shifted system is zero. With this shift we have\nbou6 | zero equals E one is less than E two is less than three is less than\ns7uq | and En approaches positive infinity.\nl11a | using this equation show\nllit | and thus\nmf1f | for some constant independent of beta. Use the fact that the expected value of F as a function of beta equals negative one over beta times the natural logarithm of Z as a function of beta to show that for large enough\nm61m | beta, the absolute value of the expected value of F as a function of beta is less than a constant times exp of negative the quantity beta minus beta sub zero times E two possibly for a different constant independent of beta. Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that\npnz9 | the absolute value of F as a function of beta minus E one is less than a constant times exp of negative the quantity beta minus beta sub zero times the quantity E two minus E one. Voilà! This shows that for a system with countably many states and just one state of lowest energy, if thermal equilibrium is possible at some positive temperature, then the free energy must approach this lowest energy exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity. Now let's show something similar for the expected energy. Again we use the shifted system to simplify the calculations. I'll leave more work to you this time.\n1abn | the partial derivative with respect to beta of Z as a function of beta equals negative the sum from n equals two of E tilde sub n times exp of negative beta E tilde sub n. Use this to show that the partial derivative with respect to beta of Z as a function of beta goes to zero exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity. Using\n8un4 | the expected value of E tilde as a function of beta equals negative the partial derivative with respect to beta of the natural logarithm of Z as a function of beta equals negative one over Z as a function of beta times the partial derivative with respect to beta of Z as a function of beta and Puzzle fifty-eight, show that the expected value of E tilde as a function of beta goes to zero exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity. Using Puzzle fifty-seven, conclude that the expected value of E as a function of beta approaches E sub one exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity. Finally, since\ns0ti | S equals k times beta times the quantity F minus the expected value of E and both F and the expected value of E approach E sub one exponentially fast as beta approaches positive infinity, conclude that S approaches zero exponentially fast as\n```",
