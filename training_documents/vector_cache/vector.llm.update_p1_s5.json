In addition, by varying AAV serotype, promotor, and titer, it is possible to affect the cell specificity of expression or the expression levels of the protein of interest. Dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra projecting to the striatum, comprising the nigrostriatal pathway, are involved in movement control and degenerate in Parkinson's disease. AAV-based gene targeting to the projection area of these neurons in the striatum has been studied extensively to induce the production of neurotrophic factors for disease-modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease. Much less emphasis has been put on AAV-based gene therapy targeting dopamine neurons in substantia nigra. We will review the literature related to targeting striatum and/or substantia nigra dopamine neurons using AAVs in order to express neuroprotective and neurorestorative molecules, as well as produce animal disease models of Parkinson's disease. We discuss difficulties in targeting substantia nigra dopamine neurons and their vulnerability to stress in general. Therefore, choosing a proper control for experimental work is not trivial. Since the axons along the nigrostriatal tract are the first to degenerate in Parkinson's disease, the location to deliver the therapy must be carefully considered. We also review studies using AAV-alpha-synuclein to target substantia nigra dopamine neurons to produce an alpha-syn overexpression disease model in rats. Though these studies are able to produce mild dopamine system degeneration in the striatum and substantia nigra and some behavioural effects, there are studies pointing to the toxicity of AAV-carrying green fluorescent protein, which is often used as a control. Therefore, we discuss the potential difficulties in overexpressing proteins in general in the substantia nigra.\njc47 | One. Introduction\nko3c | Our goal is to review adeno-associated virus vector-based gene therapy approaches to overexpress neurotrophic proteins in the striatum or substantia nigra and discuss the use of AAVs as tools to produce Parkinson's disease models in animals. AAV vector has several characteristics that favour its use for gene therapy in humans. The main advantage is that it is a non-replicating vector that rarely integrates into the host genome, and, indeed, a wild-type AAV is not known to cause any disease in humans, making it one of the safest viral vectors of choice for gene delivery to the brain. In addition to safety, AAV is able to efficiently transduce various cell types and confer long-term expression in post-mitotic cells in the brain. However, it is possible to insert only a limited size\nxek3 | of transgenic DNA, up to four point seven kilobases, slightly restricting the applicability. Different combinations of AAV serotypes and promoters can mediate the transduction of different neuron types with varying transgene expression levels in the brain. AAV serotype-two has been most commonly studied in the rodent brain and used in clinical trials, though there has been evidence that AAV-five may diffuse better in the brain parenchyma and transduce neurons more efficiently. Additionally, serotypes may be combined together in different ratios to change expression and transduction. With many AAV options available (serotype, promoter, titer, volume), as well as with consideration of how the protein of interest will interact with the target cells, outcomes can vary.\nbbpr | Among degenerative brain diseases, Parkinson's disease has been the focus for gene therapy, and as such there are currently seven ongoing clinical trials for Parkinson's disease using AAVs. In Parkinson's disease, the nigrostriatal dopamine neurons that project from substantia nigra to the striatum degenerate during disease progression. The death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra results in the cardinal motor symptoms of the disease such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. A number of factors contribute to the neurodegeneration, including disturbances in mitochondrial respiration, environmental risk to certain toxins, chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress, and gene mutations. Though the etiology of sporadic Parkinson's disease (eighty-five to ninety percent of cases) is currently unknown, it seems that the substantia nigra dopamine neurons are particularly vulnerable to stress and protein aggregation. This population of neurons has higher intrinsic levels of metabolic stress and also mitochondrial dysfunction, partially due to the oxidation of dopamine. Additionally, increased intrinsic stress vulnerability of substantia nigra dopamine neurons, as compared to ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, could be due to their distinct autonomous rhythmic activity at a low frequency with broad action potentials.\n5zyf | Regarding the genetic causes of Parkinson's disease, some of the familial forms are related to mitochondria dysfunction or alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) mutations and duplications or triplications of the alpha-syn locus. Interestingly, the pathological hallmark of both sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease are the Lewy bodies, inclusions containing alpha-syn and many other proteins. Moreover, Lewy pathology is also observed in non-dopaminergic neurons during Parkinson's disease progression.\n```",
