You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

06yq | Microdosing with psychedelics to self-medicate for ADHD symptoms in adults: A naturalistic study

o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,

82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

otkr | The chronically ill pet may be brought to the veteri- nary facility with a "chief concern" of weight gain or weight loss. The hydrated pet with weight loss will have often lost both fat and muscle mass. These more chronic concerns have usually developed over a period of at least 1-2 weeks. Changes in body weight should trigger a number of questions directed at determining duration, changes in environment, diet, appetite, presence of intesti- nal signs, travel history, water intake and urine output, etc.
ibgs | 9. Vaccinations and medications. The owner of every pet should be asked about current, recent and previous medi- cations given. Knowing what vaccinations have been given, when, and where may become valuable. Responses by the pet, positive or negative, to any medications should be noted. This information is not only important to help diagnose the disease, but might also help with its subse- quent treatment management. A young dog may have been successfully treated at another hospital with gluco- corticoids and parenteral fluids. Later, the dog relapses with the same symptoms after the effects of the treatment dissipated. This treatment history would be classic for adrenocortical insufficiency.
colo | 10. The animal's present condition. After all of the above infor- mation has been obtained, it is helpful to know if the previous treatment(s) has helped. The basic question is whether the animal is doing better, remaining the same, or getting worse.
d6r4 | All of the above information will help the clinician accom- plish the clinical mandate of "knowing thy patient."
9mrz | QUESTIONS FOR THE VAGUE CLINICAL COMPLAINT
pk06 | There are occasions when the clinician is presented with a patient where there is virtually no accompanying medical history. Herein lies the formidable challenge of trying to solve the unknown (see ch. 8). The circumstances surrounding this particular situation might involve a stray animal, a pet that is mostly kept out of doors, the person knows little about the pet, or a pet owner is unable to communicate. The recom- mended approach is to attempt identification of the chief complaint(s) and then to obtain as much as possible of the information described above. If the person accompanying the animal cannot provide this important information, ask to speak with someone who might be able to provide more information. If not possible, diagnosis will depend on the results of a physical examination, any imaging and/or labora- tory test results, and the experience of the clinician.
