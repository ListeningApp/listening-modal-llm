        "content": "ma93 | holobionts; two compare biodiversity patterns across coral colonies, hosts, reefs, islands geographic and Lagrangian oceanic circulation distances, and all contextual environmental parameters measured; three integrate the Tara Pacific data into the Tara Oceans global plankton dataset. In addition, co-occurrence graph techniques inspired from systems biology are used to reconstruct OTU interaction sub-networks, and we will aim to disentangle the intrinsic symbiotic auto-organization from the extrinsic environmental, historical contingencies forces on holobiont biodiversity. Overall, this study is the first attempt to characterize coral reef and holobiont diversity across comprehensive taxonomic, ecological, and geographical scales over an entire oceanic basin. Comparison with Tara Oceans plankton data will also reveal which part of the coral holobiont biodiversity is found in the open ocean and thus bring fundamental information about reef connectivity, as recently shown for Symbiodiniaceae, which are found all over the plankton.\n\nc6hh | The sequencing of the holotranscriptomes of coral holobionts sampled along the transect will provide important genetic information to uncover ecological and evolutionary questions at both intraspecific and community levels. Two protocols are successively applied on total RNA from three specimens per species and per site. In a first step, a polyA plus enrichment protocol is applied to provide eukaryotic M R N A in order to study the coral and Symbiodiniaceae dual transcriptome, and in a second step, R R N A is removed from the remaining polyA minus fraction to sequence microbial M R N A. We are applying different metatranscriptomics protocols to capture the gene expression of the Cnidaria, Symbiodiniaceae, bacteria and archaea, other microbes, and even viruses from the same initial tissue samples. In addition, we are using similar analysis procedures after filtration of coral-surrounding water samples. This may potentially reveal how microbes and viruses interact with the coral host and how the coral host adapts or acclimatizes to their presence. On top of providing deep insight on gene expression networks at the holobiont level, M R N A samples will also be used to generate transcriptome-wide SNPs for the coral host, allowing in-depth characterization of the patterns of diversity, connectivity, demographic history, and local adaptation of sampled coral species. Hence, the resulting patterns will provide a solid foundation on which to base the study of partner relationships within the coral holobiont, and possibly even allow for the identification of the selective forces acting on key genes for these symbiotic associations, plus an account on standing genetic diversity within and between reefs to highlight regions of high genetic endemicity and diversity important for conservation efforts.\n\ny7ea | A metabolomic approach\n\nnav4 | We will also assess the metabolome i.e., the metabolic diversity of the three targeted coral species two stony and one fire coral, see above. Small molecules i.e., specialized metabolites are the end products of unique metabolic pathways. Most of these presumably possess an ecological role, and as such, they represent key phenotypic traits for the specimens. The broad geographical cover of the collected coral species will enable us to provide some insight into the relative contribution of environmental factors and the genetic information expressed in the metabolome by comparison with genomic data. Recent advances in analytical techniques and bioinformatics led to the development of global metabolomics approaches capable of providing an overview of the thousands of metabolites present in a minute amount of sample. A nontargeted metabolomics approach is applied to the three species of corals collected across the Pacific Ocean using both MS and NMR. The subsequent identification of the chemomarkers unveiled by these comparative approaches are performed using not only databases of experimental spectra but also comparison with in silico databases of metabolites. The results will finally contribute to the assessment of the reef health status when combined with other \"-omics\" data.\n\ngem8 | Identifying the interaction among environmental stressors, the holobiont, and coral resilience\n\ne8nr | A key question to be addressed by Tara Pacific is how reef corals change geographically and how corals locally adapt or acclimate to environmental changes and increasing stress. This question has been rarely studied at the scale of a complete ocean and across multiple populations under consideration of phenotypic traits. The physiological status of corals will be assessed by measuring the parameters of coral growth such as density, linear extension, and calcification rates of P. lobata with added Diploastrea heliopora in few places colonies by analyzing coral cores recovering the last fifty to one hundred fifty years by sclerochronology. The annual density bands and growth parameters of the massive coral sampled along the transect will be determined using X-ray radiography and three D-computed tomography of growth rings on sliced coral cores, allowing the calculation of recent reef growth over the last decades and century. In parallel, ambient sea temperature and pH changes over the same period of time will be documented by analyzing, at an annual or monthly timescale, the most advanced geochemical tracers along the cores, such as boron isotopes or trace elements, trapped along the cores during the coral life. Recent stress events will be identified by a series of conventional markers of physiological stress or damage. In addition, telomere length measurements of coral and microalgal symbiont genomes will be conducted. Notably, although measurements of telomere length as a method of assessing stress accumulation is currently being employed in numerous human cohort studies, the importance of telomere length for stress resilience and biodiversity in ecological studies is in its infancy and remains to be determined. Thus, it will be highly informative to compare telomere length variations with coral growth measurements assessed by sclerochronology.\n\nk78w | More broadly, the integration of environmental and physicochemical with biological data will allow us to pinpoint the specific adaptations that enable corals to live and survive across environmental gradients. Comparison of current to historical data throughout the Pacific will then show the biological cost of this adaptation and the associated time span. This in turn will make for a much better understanding of the capacity of coral holobionts to adapt to adverse environmental conditions and the required time scales.\n\ng9du | We are keen to thank the Tara Ocean Foundation teams and crew, without which Tara Pacific would not exist.",
