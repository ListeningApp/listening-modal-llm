You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:

0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

In this study, we built on existing conceptual and empirical literatures to specify and test a predictive model of voice that in- cluded several of the possible person-centered and situa- tional antecedents of voice. Using a reliable measure of voice with initial construct validity support, our model explained 17% of the variance in peer ratings of employee voice behavior assessed 6 months later.

The variable self-esteem was also a marginally significant predictor of voice 6 months later. Individuals with high levels of global self-esteem were more likely to engage in voice than individuals with low levels of self-esteem. The situational variables also explained a significant amount of variance in peer-rated voice behavior. Consis-

Although the zero-order correlation was not significant, the regression analysis suggested that after several other variables were considered, there was a relationship be- tween style of management and voice such that those in self-managed groups engaged in more voice than those in traditional groups.
jomo | In addition, our results demonstrated the importance
06fi | of considering interactions between person-centered and situational factors as predictors of voice. Consistent with Brockner's (1988) behavior plasticity theory, the relation- ship between the situational variables and voice was stronger for individuals with lower self-esteem. Low self- esteem individuals were more responsive to situational stimuli that foster voice. Extending the general idea of behavior plasticity theory to satisfaction, we proposed that the relationship between the situational variables and voice would be stronger for individuals with lower satis- faction. Instead, we found stronger situational relation- ships for those individuals with higher levels of satisfaction.
hb4s | Rethinking the Satisfaction-Contextual Factors Interactions
cqq2 | Although we found significant interactions between sat- isfaction and contextual factors, the pattern of the relation- ships was the opposite of what we had predicted. Those with higher satisfaction were more responsive to the situa- tional factors than those with lower satisfaction. This un- expected finding suggests the need to review the assump- tions behind our hypotheses.
1ews | High satisfaction implies high plasticity. We had as- sumed that those with high satisfaction with the group were fulfilling their values, in part, through the group and that this would cause them to be more attached to the group. We expected that their attachment to and depen- dence on the group for continued satisfaction would cause them to engage in voice regardless of contextual factors. That is, we did not expect voice to vary significantly across situations for highly satisfied individuals. The pat- tern illustrated by the plots in Figures 3 and 4, however,
afyn | reveals that the favorability of group conditions (i.e., small or self-managed groups ) had a strong influence on the voice behavior of highly satisfied individuals. Highly satisfied individuals in large or traditionally-managed groups engaged in the same amount of voice as those who were less satisfied. However, when highly satisfied individuals were in small or self-managed groups, they engaged in more voice than those who were less satisfied. Kahn's (1990) research on "personal engagement" pro- vides one possible explanation for this finding.
