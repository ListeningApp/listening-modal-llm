You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document.

Your task is to label each textbox with exactly one of the following labels:
  title: the primary document title, no more than one per document
  heading: the name of the following chapter or section (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  subheading: a secondary heading, often following another heading (should never start in the middle of the previous paragraph)
  body: main paragraph content: may start or end in the middle of a word, use context to follow paragraphs that are split across textboxes (if a textbox contains both heading and body text, label it "body")
  math: textbox primarily containing math
  imageDescription: standalone callout that only describes an image, chart, table, or similar (typically begins with "Table...", "Figure...", "Fig. ...", "Above...", "Left...", etc.)
  authors: names of contributors to this document
  institutions: list of universities, business, and other institutions affiliated with this document
  publisher: info about the publisher, or provided by the publisher, including copyright info
  pagenum: the page number
  headerOrFooter: boilerplate text page number, or redundant headings at the top/bottom of the page
  toc: the table of contents
  references: bibliographic references and resources
  acknowledgements: thanks and credits to contributors
  appendix: index, appendix, or any other end matter not part of the main thread (including related headings)
  table: tabular data, label, title, or subheading for a grid or list of data
  datum: numeric data or data label from a chart or list
  advertisement: promotional ads and marketing
  layout: non-content related to the layout of the page, e.g. sidebar navigation
  callout: pull quote or long block text that stands apart from the main text
  footnote: footnotes and endnotes near the bottom of the page
  keywords: list of keywords or tags
  url: web address or email
  other: any other text that does not belong to the main thread

Each line of input is prefixed with a textbox ID in the format `id | Text content`. The output must be in the format `id | label`.

Note that body text may be split across multiple textboxes, and textboxes may start or end in the middle of a sentence or word. Because the text was extracted from a web page or document, paragraphs of body text may be interrupted by multiple textboxes of redundant headers, footnotes, page numbers, tables, images, etc. For example, a real heading will never interrupt the middle of a sentence. Use context clues like this to carefully label each textbox.

2taz | Keywords: ADHD Microdosing Psychedelics Self-medication Well-being Time perception
o3ya | ADHD in adulthood is often overlooked, which negatively affects the individual's well-being. First-line phar- macological interventions are effective in many ADHD patients, relieving symptoms rapidly. However, there seems to be a proportion of individuals who discontinue, or fail to respond to these treatments. For these in- dividuals, alternative treatment options should be explored.
r5il | 1. Introduction
5gui | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders worldwide. Prevalence research indicates that 2.6% of the adult population has persistent ADHD. ADHD in adults is often overlooked because of the high comorbidity rate and lack of knowledge about how ADHD is expressed in adulthood (Kooij et al.,
9d4o | Fig. 1. Flowchart of included participants for each time point.
82qc | 2019). In addition, ADHD is associated with deficits in various domains of cogni- tive functioning. Twenty-five percent of ADHD cases suffered from ADHD symptoms purely because of de- ficiencies in temporal processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).
ls7d | First-line ADHD treatments in adults mainly include pharmacological interventions to enhance dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotrans- mission with stimulants. Overall, they have been proven to work effectively in adults with ADHD, inducing fast symptom relief and thereby enhancing the person's quality of life. In the

The target population included adults diagnosed with ADHD and individuals who experienced ADHD symptoms to the extent that these interfered with their daily lives and who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included in the analyses, participants needed to score above a cut-off point on at least one of the subscales of the Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV).

ixcc | Questions for Focusing Collective Attention
8p6h | on Your Situation
pmgl | What question, if answered, could make the most difference to the future of (your specific situation)?
90no | What's important to you about (your specific situation) and why do you care?
jt0y | What draws you/us to this inquiry? What's our intention here? What's the deeper pur- pose (the big "why") that is really worthy of our best effort?
qb7o | . What opportunities can you see in (your specific situation)?
oae5 | What do we know so far/still need to learn about (your specific situation)?
s0fl | What are the dilemmas/opportunities in (your specific situation)?
43ia | What assumptions do we need to test or challenge here in thinking about (your specific situation)?
3g2y | What would someone who had a very different set of beliefs than we do say about (your specific situation)?
gc7v | Questions for Connecting Ideas and Finding Deeper Insight
wqfv | What's taking shape? What are you hearing under- neath the variety of opinions being expressed? What's in the center of the table?
j30a | What's emerging here for you? What new connections are you making?
7bdk | What had real meaning for you from what you've heard? What surprised you? What challenged you?
fim0 | incorporate time for systemwide reflection in order to enable members to share insights and emerging ques- tions. Collective reflection provides opportunities for the shared meaning-making that is essential in times of turbulence and change.
ojro | Nurturing Communities of Practice. Many of the most provocative questions that are vital to an organization's future are first discovered on the front lines, in the middle of the action of everyday life. But
l6t9 | 12
1ujy | What's missing from this picture so far? What is it we're not seeing? What do we need more clarity about?
qzor | What's been your/our major learning, insight, or discover so far?
a0by | What's the next level of thinking we need to do?
u1ky | If there was one thing that hasn't yet been said in order to reach a deeper level of understanding/ clarity, what would that be?
htm9 | Questions That Create Forward Movement
8hul | What would it take to create change on this issue?
87vz | What could happen that would enable you/us to feel fully engaged and energized about (your specific situation)?
ym66 | What's possible here and who cares? (rather than "What's wrong here and who's responsible?")
l0a3 | What needs our immediate attention going forward?
u8nw | If our success was completely guaranteed, what bold steps might we choose?
l2v9 | . How can we support each other in taking the next steps? What unique contribution can we each make?
afbe | What challenges might come our way and how might we meet them?
78r8 | What conversation, if begun today, could ripple out in a way that created new possibilities for the future of (your situation)?
320g | What seed might we plant together today that could make the most difference to the future of (your situation)?
tp8g | these key strategic questions are often lost because few of today's leaders have been trained to notice, honor, and utilize the social fabric of learning that occurs through informal "communities of practice" that exist throughout the organization.A community of practice is made of up people who share a common interest and who work together to expand their indi- vidual and collective capacity to solve problems over time.
gxfd | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
s2v1 | Nurturing these learning networks and honoring the questions they care about is another core aspect of the leader's new work. It is important to under- stand how these communities deal with the ques- tions and learning needs that arise in the course of the daily life of the organization. These understand- ings can provide clues about how the knowledge that resides in such communities might be engaged in the service of critical strategic questions. Leaders who take communities of practice into account as impor- tant strategic assets help assure that new work processes or organizational structures do not destroy the fabric of collective knowledge that is woven into these informal groups.
jkp9 | Using Collaborative Technologies. Intranet and groupware technologies are now making it possi- ble for widely dispersed work groups to participate in learning conversations and team projects across time and space. As these tools become even more widely available, the notion of "network leadership" will expand to include supporting widespread online con- versations where members throughout the organiza- tion can contribute their own questions and best thinking to critical strategic issues. The HP case shows how important enabling technology infrastructures are for strategic innovation. Several forward-looking companies, including Hallmark, Kodak, Discover Card, and General Motors, are now using an innova- tive online conversational technology, Communispace (www.communispace.com), to listen to their cus- tomers' concerns and questions at a deep level and generate insights about new products at a faster rate than was previously possible.
z8tt | Such collaborative tools will be a critical factor in how well strategic questions can travel both within the organization and among customers and other stakeholders who are key to success. These technolo- gies of engagement create possibilities for individuals and groups to connect with each other and to the larger whole in ways that were previously unimagin- able. Leaders who are not skilled in their use or who do not recognize their strategic importance and sup- port their use throughout their organizations will be at a significant disadvantage.
9g22 | THE ART OF POWERFUL QUESTIONS
41fx | Co-Evolving the Future
7um8 | It is quite easy to learn the basics of crafting power- ful questions. However, once you understand the importance of inquiry, it's hard to turn back. As your questions become broader and deeper than before, so does your experience of life. There is no telling where a powerful question might lead you. Transformative conversations can result from posing a simple ques- tion such as, "What questions are we not asking our- selves about the situation in the Middle East?" Tantalizing possibilities emerge from the simple act of changing an article from "in" to "for," as in the HP example. Profound systemic change can emerge from creating a process discipline such as the Game Plan for discovering and acting on the "big questions" within a business setting.
uow2 | For organizations that need collaborative learning and breakthrough thinking in order to create a sustain- able future, asking "questions that matter" and engaging diverse constituencies in learning conversations are a core process for value creation. Because questions are inherently related to action, they are at the heart of an organization's capacity to mobilize the resources required to create a positive future. Seeing the organi- zation as a dynamic network of conversations through which the enterprise develops encourages members at every level to search for questions related to real work that can catalyze collective energy and momentum. For all of us, thoughtful participation in discovering and exploring powerful questions can make a difference- to our team, to our organization, and to the larger com- munities of which we are a part.
iat7 | Living systems evolve by developing a coherent identity, creating connections in complex webs of rela- tionships, and distributing information widely through- out the organization.At the same time, human systems naturally evolve toward the questions that they ask. Seeing the ways in which the art and architecture of powerful questions can help an organization create its path into the future, and utilizing process principles, tools, and technologies that support this evolution, is everyone's job. For it is only in this way that organiza- tions are able to cultivate both the knowledge required to thrive economically today as well as the wisdom needed to ensure a sustainable future.
