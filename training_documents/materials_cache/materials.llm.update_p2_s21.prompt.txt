You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

195r | and ai is the primitive translation vectors of crystal lat- tice. The displacement of each atom is calculated from the derivative of the enthalpy H per unit cell as
kqmi | Axi = - Ki J dơi dH
g8rd | (9)
nns9 | The constant ki is scaled to ensure so that the norm of displacement does not exceed the given maximum value, Axmax, for each optimization step. Similarly, the primi- tive lattice vectors a¿ is optimized as

2nib | To reach the local optima of the problem given by Eq. (7), we gradually reduce Axmax and AAmax as
naev | Axmax = Q7-14x(1) Imax
7h0h | AA(m) = Axmax "max 4000
a64c | 3 (12)
gi7n | where o is a constant and n is the number of geometrical optimization steps. The values of pameters such as a, ky, kj, and P are discussed in Supplementary Informa- tion [33]. One may consider that structures are never re- laxed due to the discontinuity in the first derivative of the potential. However, the structure converges to an opti- mal solution by gradually reducing the maximum A.xmax and AAmax, even though there is the discontinuity. The effectiveness of linear relaxations of inequality constraints has already been shown in the previous studies on the densest sphere packings as iterative-balance method [34- 36]: The method enables the structures to reach a local optima precisely enough to calculate packing fractions. The inequality constraints are widely approximated by the logarithmic barrier functions [37], but the advantage of the linear potentials consists of the two folds: One is that the computational cost is the lowest and the other is that the potentials can impose hard penalties only when the constraints are not satisfied.
3pn1 | Next we turn our discussion to the second object func- tion in the paired mathematical programming formalism. The problem is how to determine the values of dair (min) and d(max) ijT 2. In the following discussion, we focus on the crys- tal structures of oxides. We introduce the five kinds of geometrical constraints as listed in Table I and illustrated in Fig. 1. The minimum and maximum distances are de- termined as
wjuz | = max p : [ s ] (p) (p,min)
3yxv | (min)
d8zj | SiiT "ijT
ywxn | ʹijT
uxhs | d(max) ijT = ma p J.(p) SijT ijT
ed6e | (p,max)
6qqm | (13)
onum | (p)
3iir | where Siir E {0, 1} is a switch variable selecting one of
7a0a | the geometrical constraints, and p runs chemical bond (CB), non-bonding constraint (NBC), anionic constraint (AC), cationic constraint (CC), and polyhedral con- straint (PC). The geometrical constraints for every pair of atoms are assigned depending on the network of CBs. CBs or NBCs are formed between every pair of an an- ion and a cation. ACs are formed between every pair of anions. Besides, if two coordination polyhedra around cations share some bridging anions, PC is formed be- tween the two cations. Finally, CCs are formed between remained pairs of cations. To assist making coordination polyhedra, NBCs spatially separate the anion and cation when CB is not formed between them. ACs impose the hard-spherical constraint for every pair of anions; oxygen ions often constitute the Barrow-packings if the cationic radii are small. CCs are necessary to spatially separate two cations enough to avoid the condensation of cations, while a minimum distance of PC is smaller than that of CC to share a common edge or face as
o1qp | r(M) D(shared) + D(shared)
jrik | otherwise N (CBA) )=1, (14)
xv78 | (PC,min)
sdks | 'ijT
y8fb | where D(shared) is the minimum distance from the cation i to the shared common edge or face as detailed in Sup- plementary Information [33].
521q | Since any cation i has the desirable coordination num- ber N.(CB) for CBs, the feasible linked-polyhedra must satisfy the conditions of
yogo | s(+) (N(CB) - n[CB) = 0,
2285 | (15)
ys0g | where nå n(CB) is the coordination number, which is counted by the number of CBs for atom i, and s+) (+) is a switch function for the atom i given by
7zvp | (16)
ww6u | 0 if the atom i is anion .
hpi6 | Most of random initial structures are infeasible solu- tions, and the analytic optimization methods such as the steepest-descent method cannot escape from the infeasi- ble solution to a feasible solution. Therefore, we period- ically update the values of d(min) and d(max) depending on the network of CBs that are also renewed periodi- cally. The network is determined from the maximization problem of the number of CBs given by
