You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

meyw | Globalization, via trade and foreign direct investments (FDI), can also be attributed to an additional channel through which economic development affects environmental impact and income inequality (Zhuang et al. 2014). When discussing CO2 emissions, the reviewed authors provide different results. Some authors found that FDI and trade contribute to economic growth and to the degradation of environment at the same time (Shahbaz et al. 2015; Kivyiro and Arminen 2015; Ertugrul et al., 2016; Azam and Khan 2016; Sarkodie and Strezov, 2019). Other authors showed that FDI and trade contribute to economic development due to technology development, productivity and efficiency gains, and promotion of new and more innovative processes and managerial skills (Shahbaz et al., 2015) resulting in the reduction of environmental impact in host countries (Sbia et al. 2014; Tang and Tan 2015; Zhang and Zhou 2016; Kang et al. 2016). As far as income inequality is concerned, the mechanisms of FDI and trade openness dif- fer, and the results of the estimations are different as well (Dreher and Gaston 2008; Celik and Basdas 2010; Ines 2011; He and Feng 2019).
2e62 | Therefore, the reviewed results display that, in the case of economic development, income inequality level and CO2 emissions could change differently and separate channels af- fect these variables differently.
75y3 | The approaches to the influence of income inequality on production- and consumption-based emissions
s2g2 | Almost all authors (listed in Table 1) have analysed the rela- tionship between income inequality and territorial or production-based CO2 emissions. However, only few of the studies have estimated the consumption-based emissions (see Golley and Meng 2012; Hübler 2017) or analysed the consumption-based emission inequality (see Wang and Zhou 2018; Xu et al. 2016). Baker (2018) and Jorgenson et al. (2019) emphasize that research should focus on international inequality impact on both consumption- and production-based CO2 emissions. With respect to the production-based emis- sions, the leakage phenomenon should also be considered, which is defined as a process where the transfer of dirty in- dustries to the emerging economies with weak regulatory sys- tems rather than the increase in production efficiency and productivity accounts for the decrease of CO2 emissions in the developed countries (Carvalho et al. 2013; Ertugrul et al. 2016; Bilgili et al. 2016).
q1q2 | Three theories have been proposed by the authors that the- oretically analyse the approaches of relationship between in- come inequality and environmental impact: (i) political econ- omy explanation (in this paper, it is renamed as determination of environmental policies), which was suggested by Boyce (1994); (ii) economic behaviours of households (the latter the- ory overlaps with the MPE theory), suggested by Ravallion et al. (2000), and "Veblen effect" (Schor 1998; Veblen 2009); (iii) inequality determined changes in working time, which could also be attributed to "Veblen effect", discussed by Bowles and Park (2005). These theories were widely discussed by other authors (Table 2). However, the authors who presented these theories usually referred to the production-based emissions. Meanwhile, in this paper, it is assumed that all the abovementioned approaches do not

Thus, it is emphasized that the approaches should be separated when analysing the production and consumption-based CO2 emis- sions. The following sections propose the separate approaches to the influence of income inequality on the production-based and consumption-based emissions.
epu7 | The approaches to income inequality impact on production-based CO2 emissions
7od1 | Regarding the production-based CO2 emissions, only two of the abovementioned approaches are appropriate: determina- tion of environmental policies and inequality determined changes in working time. Determination of environmental policies operates mainly via political influence due to the changes in income inequality (Boyce 1994). Boyce hypothe- sized that the increasing demand for "the environment" is related to the increase in income. Therefore, in the countries where the inequality level is usually low, the prevailing higher environmental standards condition lower levels of emissions. Other authors state that the reduction of environmental impact might request a higher political and economic equality at first (Roberts and Parks 2006; Downey 2015). Meanwhile, accord- ing to Franzen and Vogl (2013) and Berthe and Elie (2015), a higher level of income inequality causes the material and so- cial problems to take priority over the environmental aspects. Thus, inequality renders the agreement on environmental pol- icies and implementation of these policies more difficult (Hourcade 2013; Laurent 2014; Chancel et al. 2018). In de- veloping countries, where the level of income inequality is usually high, the environmental standards are low. Grunewald et al. (2017) suggested that the growth of income inequality impedes environmental policy solutions to emerg- ing issues, which subsequently conditions that the growth of inequality can contribute to the increase of air pollutions.
0bqy | Besides, expensive environmental protection in wealthy coun- tries generates the transfer of dirty production to poor coun- tries, where the environmental standards are low. Consequently, due to the leakage phenomenon, the CO2 emis- sions increase in developing (or of higher inequality) coun- tries, while in developed (or of lesser inequality) countries, the pollution level decreases. Furthermore, within countries, rich communities reap disproportionate benefits from dirty activi- ties and avoid the negative consequences (as air pollution) of their production by moving polluting industrial activities into less rich areas (Boyce 2007; Martinez-Alier and Muradian 2015; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Chancel et al. 2018). This reveals that income inequality promotes and enhances the implemen- tation of environment-polluting projects, which strengthens the power of the rich society to impose environmental fine on the poor (Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). Hence, for the less developed countries, inequality is as an obstacle for the mobilization of the collective effort essential for confronting environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions (Islam 2015; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017). Moreover, Gassebner et al. (2008) and Grunewald et al. (2017) stated that rising income inequality in less rich countries is related to industrial reduction and a decrease of producers' political power, there- by reducing their ability to decrease environmental impact.
