        "content": "ywwr | Hydrogen has the capacity to meet future emission targets by decarbonizing the industry, mobility, electricity, and heat generation. But, hydrogen utilization and the implementation of a hydrogen economy at large scale requires significant storage capacities. Underground hydrogen storage in porous geological structures has the potential to meet these storage requirements. Positive and cautionary indicators for safe hydrogen storage in porous structures were identified, and a comparison and linkage with existing and planned aboveground hydrogen infrastructures was established. We have identified porous sandstone formations located at depths ranging from eight hundred to one thousand one hundred meters and exhibiting temperatures exceeding forty degrees Celsius as highly promising reservoirs for hydrogen storage. Specifically, porosities exceeding twenty percent and permeabilities greater than five hundred millidarcies were identified as positive indicators for adequate storage capacity. Brine pH values below six and salinities above one hundred milligrams per liter are desirable for effective hydrogen storage that will minimize biotic and abiotic reactions. Based on our estimates, the total hydrogen storage capacity in underground natural gas facilities is projected to be as high as eight billion cubic meters, or equivalently, zero point seventy-two megatonnes at standard temperature and pressure. This capacity translates into a potential energy equivalent of twenty-nine terawatt hours of hydrogen. Additionally, saline aquifers could accommodate eighty-one point six to six hundred ninety-one point eight megatonnes of hydrogen, equivalent to an energy potential of three point two to twenty-seven point three petawatt hours of hydrogen that would meet predicted storage requirements many times over. Most of these sites are located in the North German Basin. We conclude that pore storage systems are likely to play a vital role in the future German hydrogen infrastructure, particularly in regions with significant demand for industrial hydrogen storage and potential imports via pipelines and ships. We recommend that future research focus on assessing the technical storage potential of these sites and their compatibility with planned hydrogen infrastructures and industrial demand.\n0i6j | Data availability statement\n87cq | The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article or Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n0qs3 | Author contributions\nz8f7 | KA designed the study.
