I have not attempted to bring it \"up to date\" in the sense of any tampering with the text, or softening or altering the opinions held by the author. Too many critics praise or censure Burney's work (and, indeed, all Histories) in accordance with the treatment, sympathetic or otherwise, meted out to their own particular period. Burney's History is not a period History-it is a General History, and it is an intensely personal one. I do not intend to embark upon a defence of Burney's opinions; they were his own, and they cannot be dismissed lightly; but I must draw attention to one thing that is frequently overlooked by many, and that is the necessity of appreciating the eighteenth century meaning of words such as barbarous and licentious, etc. The age of Burney was an age of frank speaking, and one must not ignore this fact when reading works of that period. Burney often uses words which have, since his day, received a more special meaning, and if this is kept in mind many of his so-called \"savage and harsh strictures\" will not appear unfair.\npmgl | In the present edition, Burney's text and notes (with the original spelling) have been given in full and unaltered with the following exceptions:\n90no | One. The transcription of the musical tract by Tunsted in the second book has been punctuated correctly.\njt0y | Two. A more correct version of Cutell's tract in Book Two has been substituted.\nqb7o | Three. The titles of the early English Psalters have been given in more detail.\noae5 | All the dates and corrections enclosed in square brackets are additions for which I am responsible.\ns0fl | The work has been re-indexed, and I trust that the new index will be found more useful than the original one.\n43ia | The musical examples are also complete with the exception of a very dull example of a degree exercise, which will be found in Volume Three, page three hundred fifty-one, of the original edition. One or two examples of the difficulties to be found in Virginal music have been curtailed, but enough remains to show the nature of the difficulty. In his musical examples, Burney employs almost every variety of clef. I think that the only one I have not discovered is the old French\n3g2y | A GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC\ngc7v | violin clef. The unusual ones have been altered to modern usage, but I have retained the tenor and alto C clefs.\nwqfv | The question of the examples of Tudor music has given me considerable trouble. Burney not only alters that peculiar feature of the technique of the period, the so-called false relation or augmented octave, but in some cases his scansion of the words has made him change a semibreve into a dotted minim and a crotchet. All cases of wrong notes have been altered, but in the majority of cases I have allowed his arrangement of the words to stand.\nj30a | For the sake of convenience Burney's volumes are called Books, so that Book One is Burney's Volume One, etc. When volume is mentioned it refers to the present edition.\n7bdk | My own notes are indicated by asterisks, and in selecting those inserted, from the large number I had prepared, I have been influenced by what might be most useful to the non-specialist.\nfim0 | Abbreviations Used in the Editor's Notes\nojro | O.X.

Pleasure and innocence ought never to be separated; yet we seldom find them otherwise than at variance, except when Music brings them together.\n87vz | To those who know that Music is among your Majesty's recreations, it is not necessary to display its purity, or assert its dignity. May it long amuse your leisure, not as a relief from evil, but as an augmentation of good; not as a diversion from care, but\nym66 | as a variation of felicity. Such, Madam, is my sincerest wish, in which I can, however, boast no peculiarity of reverence or zeal; for the virtues of your Majesty are universally confessed; and however the inhabitants of the British empire may differ in their opinions upon other questions, they all behold your excellences with the same eye, and, celebrate them with the same voice; and to that name which one nation is echoing to another, nothing can be added by the respectful admiration, and humble gratitude of, \nl0a3 | MADAM,\nu8nw | your Majesty's,\nl2v9 | most obedient\nafbe | and most devoted Servant,\n78r8 | CHARLES BURNEY.\n320g | PREFACE\ntp8g | THE feeble beginnings of whatever afterwards becomes great or eminent, are interesting to mankind. To artists, therefore, and to real lovers of art, nothing relative to the object of their employment or pleasure is indifferent.\ngxfd | Sir Francis Bacon recommends histories of art upon the principle of utility, as well as amusement; and collecting into one view the progress of an art seems likely to enlarge the knowledge, and stimulate the emulation of artists, who may, by this means, be taken out of the beaten track of habit and common practice, to which their ideas are usually confined.\ns2v1 | The love of lengthened tones and modulated sounds, different from those of speech, and regulated by a stated measure, seems a passion implanted in human nature throughout the globe; for we hear of no people, however wild and savage in other particulars, who have not music of some kind or other, with which we may suppose them to be greatly delighted, by their constant use of it upon occasions the most opposite: in the temple, and the theatre; at funerals, and at weddings; to give dignity and solemnity to festivals, and to excite mirth, cheerfulness, and activity, in the frolicsome dance. Music, indeed, like vegetation, flourishes differently in different climates; and in proportion to the culture and encouragement it receives; yet, to love such music as our ears are accustomed to, is an instinct so generally subsisting in our nature, that it appears less wonderful it should have been in the highest estimation at all times, and in every place, than that it should hitherto never have had its progressive improvements and revolutions deduced through a regular history, by any English writer.",
