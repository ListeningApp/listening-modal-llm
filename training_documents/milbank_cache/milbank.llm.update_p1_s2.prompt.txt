You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

oaen | Making the Case for Laws That Improve Health: A Framework for Public Health Law Research
5u67 | Context: Public health law has received considerable attention in recent years and has become an essential field in public health. Public health law research, however, has received less attention.
dvms | Methods: Expert commentary.
qrd3 | Findings: This article explores public health law research, defined as the sci- entific study of the relation of law and legal practices to population health. The article offers a logic model of public health law research and a typol- ogy of approaches to studying the effects of law on public health. Research on the content and prevalence of public health laws, processes of adopting and implementing laws, and the extent to which and mechanisms through which law affects health outcomes can use methods drawn from epidemiology, economics, sociology, and other disciplines. The maturation of public health law research as a field depends on methodological rigor, adequate research funding, access to appropriate data sources, and policymakers' use of research findings.
rxrg | Conclusions: Public health law research is a young field but holds great promise for supporting evidence-based policymaking that will improve popu- lation health.
tf43 | L AW IS AN IMPORTANT DISCIPLINE WITHIN PUBLIC HEALTH (Gostin, Burris, and Lazzarini 1999). Legal "powers, duties and re- straints" structure the mission of public health agencies and shape how it is carried out (Gostin 2008). Law is a prominent intervention tool to achieve particular public health goals. Laws and their implementation also have important unintended effects, both positive and negative, on population health. Although public health law has a long history in the United States (Tobey 1939), it was one of the fields of public health that fell into neglect when public health was thought to have conquered infectious disease. Over the past two decades, though, the reemergence of infectious disease as a major public health concern and a growing awareness of the complexity of health regulation at the local, national, and global levels have restored law to importance in public health and academic law. No longer confined to end-of-the-day conference panels on "legal and ethical issues," public health law now has its own office at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, academic centers, journals, national and international professional societies, and a shelf of important treatises (Larkin and McGowan 2008).
fcco | Notwithstanding all the writing and commentary on public health law, there has been little discussion of public health law research and its place in the fields of law and public health. The evidence produced by empirical research is important to both public health law practice and scholarship. It constitutes the "facts" justifying regulatory action and supporting normative arguments about what policies are most desirable, effective, or consistent with human rights or other legal standards. To be sure, law legitimately serves as a site for the articulation and clash of values, and lawmaking often necessitates decisions that cannot await full information. Furthermore, not all law is or can be "evidence based," even in public health. At the same time, empirical research is not just an ammunition dump for adversarial legal battle. The responsible use of law as a tool for improving public health requires a commitment to the pursuit and consideration of scientific evidence when possible. In public health, just as in health care (Sox and Greenfield 2009), evidence should inform the investment in and implementation of policy, and a consciousness of data and the scientific method can improve the decisions of policymakers and practitioners even in the absence of data. This is the promise of public health law research. At a time when empirical health law has emerged from a general flowering of empirical legal research as a distinct scholarly field (Mello and Zeiler 2008), scientific research is a

Our discussion was occasioned by the launch of a major initiative by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) to sponsor public health law research and expand the field (RWJF Public Health Law Research Program 2009). It thus is an opportune time to reflect on the field: its definition and boundaries, the types of research that a robust field of public health law research should include, and the challenges to be faced in growing and strengthening the field. (Although we are participating in the RWJF initiative as the leaders of its National Program Office, this article concerns the field of public health law research generally, not the specific priorities or funding areas of the Public Health Law Research program.)
53eu | Defining Public Health Law Research
a5u1 | We define public health law research (PHLR) as "the scientific study of the relation of law and legal practices to population health." This includes both direct relationships between law and health, and relation- ships mediated through the effects of law on health behaviors and other processes and structures that affect population health. In this section, we elaborate on this definition in order to distinguish PHLR from other fields and forms of public health law knowledge.
ry7u | Distinguishing PHLR from Public Health Law
5mda | Lawrence Gostin's widely cited definition of public health law is
i4li | the study of the legal powers and duties of the state to ensure the conditions for people to be healthy (e.g., to identify, prevent, and ameliorate risks to health and safety in the population), and the limitations on the power of the state to constrain the autonomy, privacy, liberty, proprietary, or other legally protected interests of individuals for protection or promotion of community health. (Gostin 2000, 4)
r8sm | Using this power/duty/restraint formula, Gostin succeeds in focusing the field on the state's role in managing collective action to protect the pop- ulation's health while still encompassing a diverse range of cooperating
cuin | actors and related functions, including private actors and the health care system. His claims for public health law are broad enough to earn libertarian criticism: scholars have argued from diverse standpoints that Gostin and his colleagues in public health are expanding the jurisdic- tion of public health beyond its legitimate mission and into a realm of wrongful-and counterproductive-meddling in the autonomy of citi- zens (Epstein 2003; Hall 2003; Rothstein 2002). Yet for others, Gostin's definition may be too narrow. Regulatory researchers, for example, ques- tion the importance of distinguishing between public and private actors in health governance (Black 2008; Lobel 2004; Trubek 2006). Other commentators insist that public health law must include the role of law as a determinant and mechanism for the health effects of social and physical environments (Burris, Kawachi, and Sarat 2002; Magnusson 2007; Mariner 2009).
n1i7 | Debate over the boundaries of public health law plays out differ- ently in the realm of public health law research. In defining PHLR, we are concerned not with what is right, proper, or legitimate to include within the jurisdiction of public health law but with whether law can be empirically shown to have an impact on the health of the population. Commentators might disagree on whether equality, for example, ought to be considered a public health issue, but that question is different from whether it is possible to empirically identify the ways in which law affects health inequalities. Empirical data can be highly salient to disputes about normative concepts and positions but cannot themselves resolve disputes about the legitimate scope of public health or public health law or the extent to which health promotion should be traded off against other social goods, such as civil liberties. PHLR, then, is distin- guished from public health law by its focus on description, explanation, and prediction-that is, its focus on empirical investigation.
