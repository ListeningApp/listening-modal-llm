Format dashboard so that the right emphasis is created.\negd7 | Change their location relative to each other on the dashboard so that they are all legible by clicking on individual labels and then dragging them elsewhere.\num9s | We felt comfortable making custom placements because we do not have a filter on the dashboard. We are confident that, with a specific size of the dashboard, the labels will always appear where we placed them.\nit25 | If you want to undo custom placements, you can right-click on the label and select undo the custom location, as shown in the following screenshot:\n3mfz | Adjust the size of the dashboard to five hundred forty by nine hundred pixels because it appears compressed. Unfortunately, this means that we'll have a vertical scroll bar when not using a studio monitor, but we needed to make sure that the visualizations were legible. It's better to have a vertical scroll bar than a cramped dashboard. If no one can read it, it's a waste of time and effort.\n0vyw | Dashboard Design and Styling\nrf9l | Before publishing the dashboard, right-click on every worksheet in the filmstrip and select Hide.\nhycc | This dashboard, as available on a public Tableau website. It tells the story of not only how carbon dioxide emissions have changed geographically over time, but also what compounding factors may be contribute towards the future growth of Tableau Public.\nl8ni | Summary\nipcw | In this chapter, we discussed best practices of dashboard design as well as how to build an empathetically designed user experience that tells a concise story with data. You also learned that Tableau Public dashboards are composed of one or more sheets with added elements such as text, captions, and interactivity such as filters and actions. Dashboards may also contain, or open web pages and can pass dashboard information into the web page in some instances.\nadu9 | Keep in mind that a good dashboard design helps you convey a pertinent message to the reader. Have a goal in mind pertaining to what you wish to get across to the readers. Elements of a good dashboard design start with good data and visualizations, and these visualizations come together in an aesthetically pleasing, intuitive dashboard that helps users tease out conclusions and discoveries of their own. Knowing your audience is critical to dashboard design.\npq8y | In the next chapter, we will explore filters and actions, which are important tools in adding interactivity to dashboards.\n8fpu | Filters and Actions\nkd2r | Dashboard filters and actions in Tableau Public enable users to precisely select the information that they would like to explore, which is powerful. Selecting what's interesting makes a data story personal and relevant to users; all of this is done without shifting their attention or their mouse away from the dashboard. Filters and actions create true interactivity. They also give you, as an author, the ability to connect disparate sources of data or web pages to complete user experience.\nwda6 | In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:\n862o | Adding and using Quick Filters\nzyiv | Filtering the Data sources with parameters\noy6e | Filtering the Data sources with controller worksheets\nvtgu | Highlighting actions\nc1go | Action Filters\n3kye | URL Actions\nou3n | Adding and using Filters\nd3bu | Filters are designed to meet several needs of your users; the following are some of these needs:\numpv | Limiting the scope of an analysis\n1sha | Allowing users to view only what interests them\nbw9p | Removing outliers\nwuha | Using a filter to limit the data that is extracted into your workbook improves the performance of the workbook. However, the following are the two disadvantages of using filters on dashboards:\neei5 | Using many filter actions with multiple Dimension members can slow down a dashboard's performance.\ntzc8 | Filters can be applied to only one data source at a time. So, in case multiple data sources are being used on one dashboard, you'll need to use parameters or controller worksheets to filter all of them.\nb6at | In this chapter, we will use the dashboard that we created in the previous chapter. You can download the finished product by visiting a public Tableau website. The dashboard uses only one data source at this point. As we progress through this chapter, we'll add another dashboard along with a fourth visualization.\ntak4 | Adding Filters to worksheets\nkish | In the dashboard that we are using, we have already filtered the map to show only the data for two thousand and eight, which is a blue pill on the Filters shelf, because it is a discrete number. You will also see that there are green pills for Latitude and Longitude. Both of these pills are continuous numbers, and they are included on the Filters shelf because we filtered out the null values, as shown in the following screenshot:\n6i4k | If a field is not already on the Filters shelf, you can drag it there from the Data window. Alternatively, you can create a Quick Filter by right-clicking on it in the Data window and selecting Show Quick Filter, as shown in the following screenshot. Tableau Public will then display the Quick Filter on the upper right-hand side of the workspace, but you can easily move it around the worksheet, as shown in the following screenshot:\nwenx | Chapter Eight\ndzhw | For instance, if a field is a part of a visualization and it's on the Rows or Columns shelf, the Marks card, or anywhere else, you can click on its Context menu and select Filter.\ng50k | There is a catch to adding filters. If a field is not on the Filters shelf of a worksheet, you won't be able to add it as a filter on the dashboard. In the following screenshot, we navigated to the worksheet in the workbook that has the map on it and added the filter there. In the next section of this chapter, we will go back to the dashboard and add the Quick Filter.\n260v | To add a Quick Filter for Region, perform the following steps:\n3v9q | One. Right-click on Region in the Data window.\nb3q6 | Two. Click on Show Quick Filter.\nf7n0 | Three. Then, it's time to make a selection. With a discrete field such as Region, you will see the dimension members that you can choose. The Filters dialog box is shown in the following screenshot:\nqb6z | Four. In the General tab, we can perform the following operations, as shown in the preceding screenshot:\nwt9j | Select from list: This uses either a custom list of values, or all the values.\nl4y1 | The search box: We can search for a text string that is present in a dimension member.\nrdhl | Checkboxes: Click on the checkboxes next to the dimensions that we want to keep or exclude.\nlgqb | The filter: This sets the filter to show fewer values, which means that it shows the values that are automatically limited by the selections of other filters, and it doesn't show all the discrete values in the field.\nm5n9 | All or None: You can select All or None, as required.\n94av | Exclude: This excludes the values that we have selected. If you are excluding values, be careful when exposing the filter to users. They might need some extra instructions about what the exclusion means and how to use it.\nzfsc | Summary: This shows a summary of your selection.\ntd4d | Reset: This resets all values.\n8etc | OK, Cancel, and Apply: Click on Apply and then on the OK button to filter and set worksheet.\nj4fi | Five. In our example, we selected all the values and then deselected Aggregates.\n73ie | Six. Then, we clicked on OK.\n```",
