You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

yfv2 | Chemokine receptor-ligand dynamics locally within the tumor microenvironment and more broadly, in a systemic fashion can strongly influence tumor behaviour. These dynamics can drive dysregulated autocrine and paracrine signalling loops in cancer collectively referred to as oncocrine signalling52,264. Interestingly, chemokine receptors and ligands are often aberrantly expressed at common sites of metastasis, driving tissue tropism during metastatic spread268. This has been well studied in the context of breast cancer, where it has been found that the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 are overexpressed269 (Figure 1). Interestingly, their respective ligands, CXCL12/SDF-1 and CCL21 are highly expressed in the main sites of breast cancer metastasis, such as bone marrow and lung, driving the metastatic profile of this cancer269. Indeed, CXCR4/SDF-1 signalling, has been found to potently drive breast cancer migration and metastasis187,270-272 (Figure 1). This signalling axis is so potent that tumoral expression of CCR7 is one of the most prominent predictors of metastasis and poor prognosis in several different cancer types268. Numerous other chemokine and chemokine receptor dynamics have been found to impact metastasis in different settings, including CCR9, CCR10, and CXCR5, in addition to playing complementary and significant roles in driving inflammation in the tumor microenvironment52,273,274 (Figure 1).
pujl | Targeting CXCR4/SDF-1 signalling using pharmacological inhibitors such as plerixafor, which is an FDA approved CXCR4 antagonist for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, has shown to be effective in numerous cancer types, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting this signalling axis275,276. In addition to the well-established role for CXCRs in metastasis, other classes of GPCRs have also been extensively shown to act as metastatic drivers, including PARs, LPAR, and S1PRs, and this list will likely expand as we gain a better understanding of GPCR-driven signalling networks 266,277-280
3rqe | Concomitant with this, there is mounting evidence supporting the role of GPCRs as mediators of the oncocrine signalling networks driving tumor growth and neural innervation, particularly in prostate and stomach cancers281,282. For example, activation of the ß2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) by adrenaline and noradrenaline has been found to promote secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by both cancerous and pre-cancerous cells283 (Figure 1). Release of NGF and other neurotrophins potently promote axonogenesis and subsequent tumor innervation, which establishes a paracrine signalling axis via the secretion of noradrenaline by nerves in the tumor microenvironment. This creates a dynamic feed-forward signalling mechanism by acting on cancer cells, in turn, stimulating their growth, promoting resistance to therapy, and reinforcing the expression of NGF284. The autocrine activation of muscarinic receptors is a similar oncocrine signalling axis in prostate and other cancers285,286. Enhanced secretion of acetylcholine leads to aberrant activation of the M3 muscarinic receptor (CHRM3), which has been shown to drive cancer cell proliferation and migration287,288. Aligned with this, amplification or gain of the M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors have recently been found to correlate with worse progression free survival in prostate cancer patients, and is more frequent in castration-resistant prostate cancers, which are significantly more challenging to treat compared to hormone-sensitive tumors289. Strikingly, activation of M1 and M3 signalling has recently been found to induce castration- resistant growth of prostate cancer cells, through the activation of a conserved FAK-YAP signalling axis289. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK was found to prevent YAP activation and castration-resistant growth, representing a promising therapeutic strategy against innervation- driven castration-resistance growth of prostate cancer289.
nsi3 | GPCRs and Tumor Angiogenesis
nil3 | Stimulation of angiogenesis is a key component of cancer progression for solid tumors. Angiogenic factors released by the tumor, including prostaglandins and thrombin, often act on GPCRs in the stroma and surrounding endothelial cells, such as S1PR (S1PR1-5), PAR1 (F2R), and CXCR4-7, to trigger stimulation of angiogenic mediators such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)290-295 (Figure 1). Thrombin-mediated stimulation of PAR2, for example, induces expression and release of VEGF, increased vascular permeability, and cleavage of fibrinogen to create a favourable environment for vascularization267,296-298 EP3 stimulation on endothelial cells in particular, can stimulate production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade extracellular matrix proteins, enabling neovascularization265. Release of chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 can act similarly on the stroma in addition to recruiting immune cells to drive angiogenic growth226,244,268
68a1 | In particular, interleukin 8 (IL8), encoded by CXCL8 and known to bind CXCR1 and CXCR2, is a potent pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory chemokine that can be released from the tumor, the stroma, and from neutrophils, which together can create a robust feed-forward mechanism to elicit angiogenesis228,299 (Figure 1).
seik | These dynamics are typically fine-tuned processes with robust responses induced by minute expression of signalling factors. As such, it is no surprise that tumor cells must co-opt these complex signalling networks to stimulate vascularization and drive cancer progression. Anti- VEGF treatment using the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab is commonly incorporated into cancer treatment approaches300. Moreover, co-targeting the apelin receptor APLNR in addition to VEGF blockade has shown to be a promising strategy to improve antiangiogenic therapies, particularly in glioblastoma, where APLNR has been shown to have a proangiogenic role301,302 (Figure 1). The dependency of tumors on vascularization, and the centrality of GPCRs to several of aspects of angiogenesis have made them an attractive target for the cancer therapy toolbox303. Inhibition of PAR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, and angiotensin receptors AGTR1 and AGTR2 have shown promising results and are all under current investigation as antiangiogenic cancer therapeutics304 (Figure 1). Targeting GPCRs in combination with anti-VEGF drugs may be an effective strategy to extend the clinical efficacy of each treatment alone by preventing the development of drug resistance and bridging the gap for patients with refractory cancer types.
