        "content": "g9du | It might seem that with more sensitive analysis, the ZGA timing in other mammals would shift into earlier stages and the minor ZGA could occur as early as in mice. In fact, Xue et al. reported minor ZGA in human one-cell embryos. However, there are two arguments against this possibility. First, some of the evidence for early human genome activation is possibly an experimental artifact, especially when the analysis is restricted to polyA RNA. Second, the whole transcription correlation data paint a different picture when comparing mice with human or bovine early embryos.\nf682 | The mouse model is exceptional in that minor and major ZGA produce distinct sets of RNAs that are separated by the cleavage between one-cell to two-cell embryos. This can be visualized as a difference in developmental stage transcriptome correlations when\nli1k | separating exon and intron NGS data in mice. When such analysis is done on mouse NGS, intron data show that the one-cell zygote is already establishing a \"zygotic\" nature. This is apparently because introns in maternal mRNAs were already spliced out and degraded while nascent transcripts transcribed at the one-cell stage come often from genes expressed at the two-cell stage, but never from oocyte-specific genes. At the same time, exon data from the one-cell zygote show its \"maternal\" identity because of the high abundance of residual maternal mRNAs. However, such a phenomenon is not observed in bovine early development where one cannot place a clear boundary between minor and major ZGA. Bovine and human early embryos exhibit the major shift between maternal and zygotic transcriptomes at eight to sixteen cells and four to eight cells, respectively, indicating a later onset of major ZGA in these species compared to mouse.\npbea | Mice thus activate their genomes fast in terms of cleavage stages and their minor and major ZGA waves are separated by the first cleavage event. This appears as a novel feature that evolved in the mouse lineage while the delayed major ZGA observed in humans and bovine could be the an ancestral trait. It also seems that transcriptional activation in other mammals is more incremental during the early cleavage divisions than the two bursts of transcription in one-cell and two-cell mouse embryos.\nccpt | Eight. ZGA and the nature of the \"zygotic program\"\n0fpw | While the set of genes that are transcribed during early development can be described by transcriptome profiling, the entirety of the \"zygotic program\" remains poorly defined. In mammalian development, the priority of the post-fertilization \"zygotic program\" is establishing totipotency, i.e. the ability to develop in all cell types, including extraembryonic tissues. During subsequent embryonic lineage commitment, the totipotency is reduced to pluripotency, i.e. ability to give rise to all cell types within the developing embryo, but not extraembryonic lineages. Thus, for oocyte-to-embryo reprogramming, three types of transcription programs or transcription factor networks can be distinguished:\ndqn8 | maternal -the oocyte transcription factor network includes oocyte-specific proteins such as FIGLA, NOBOX, LHX8, SOHLH1/2, FOXO3A, which are responsible for accumulation of maternal mRNAs. As mentioned above, NGS data suggest that germ cell-specific transcription factors, which control expression during oocyte growth, do not contribute to ZGA in mouse embryos. This implies efficient removal or repression of these transcription factors during ovulation and after fertilization. For example, NOBOX becomes undetectable in already preovulatory oocytes. In contrast to somatic cells, where transcription factors are retained on mitotic chromosomes and mark promoters for transcription following entry into interphase, this is not the case for condensed metaphase two chromosomes.\ncop0 | zygotic totipotent -a transcription factor network which forms in mice during the two-cell stage by maternally-provided zygotic genome-activating transcription factors and transcription factors expressed during minor and major ZGA. It is poorly understood how oocytes produce transcription factors that would be recruited for genome activation while not contributing to transcription in the oocyte. While an obvious candidate mechanism is dormancy, where translationally repressed mRNAs become translated in response to developmental stimuli, dormancy of maternal transcription factors acting in ZGA has not been explored. Nevertheless, cloning experiments document that the oocyte's ability to reprogram gene expression of a somatic nucleus into a totipotent state resides in the cytoplasm. The totipotent program forms before lineage commitment and is responsible for the totipotency of early embryo blastomeres.

Interestingly, analysis of ESCs revealed a minor subpopulation of cells with two-cell-like expression pattern, e.g. expressing MuERV-L, suggesting that the zygotic totipotent program might be induced in cultured cells.\n1k9e | embryonic pluripotent - this transcription factor network is equivalent to that of ESCs and gives cells their pluripotent properties. A subset of these transcription factors, the famous \"Yamanaka\" factor combination of Pou5f1, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, is sufficient to reprogram gene expression and induce pluripotency in differentiated somatic cells. Importantly, the pluripotent program is inter-related with the zygotic transcription factor network because its formation is initiated during ZGA.\n5bjs | The set of transcription factors and binding sites in the regulated genes that constitute mammalian ZGA is poorly defined, but details of these gene regulatory networks are emerging. A part of the mammalian ZGA gene regulatory network appears to be the pluripotency network. This raises the question to what extent is ZGA related to induction of the core pluripotency network. The answer is that although the major ZGA and induction of the core pluripotency network have some overlap, the two events are distinct. The contribution of core pluripotency factors to mammalian major ZGA seems small judging by the frequency of known binding sites of the core pluripotency factors in proximity of genes transcribed during major ZGA. Furthermore, zygotes lacking both maternal and zygotic Oct4a expression can still activate the genome and form a Nanog-expressing inner cell mass. This situation contrasts with zebrafish where a conserved core network component consisting of Nanog, Pou5f1, and SoxB1 family members represent over seventy-five percent of transcripts during the first wave of zygotic gene expression.",
