You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).

Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021.

epu7 | El-Guindi et al. [46] used stool colour (clay), US signs (tri- angular cord sign, contractile gallbladder, gallbladder length ≥20.5 mm, hepatic artery diameter <LATEX>\geq 2 . 0 5 m m ,</LATEX> hepatic artery diameter/portal vein diameter ≥0.445 mm, hepatic subcapsular flow), laboratory tests and histopathology to develop a 12- parameter diagnostic score to discriminate biliary atresia from other causes of neonatal cholestasis, reporting a sensitivity and specificity of 100% each. The main concern is the reproducibil- ity of these measurements and of this diagnostic score; Macaluso et al. [47], applying the same diagnostic score to their population, obtained less encouraging results: global sensitivity was 31% (5/16) with a specificity of 90.9% (10/11).
7od1 | Chen et al. [48] developed a noninvasive algorithm to iden- tify biliary atresia in cholestasis using five predictors (shear wave <LATEX>\mathrm { s p e e d } > 1 . 3 5 m / s ,</LATEX> triangular cord sign, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, abnormal gallbladder and clay stool). They divided patients into three risk groups and achieved high di- agnostic performance (sensitivity of 98.7% and specificity of 91.4%) in the high and intermediate risk groups.
0bqy | Discussion
b780 | According to this analysis, MR cholecystopancreatography has no role in the diagnosis of biliary atresia mainly because of the absence of visibility of the normal extrahepatic bile duct, con- sidered a diagnostic criterion by most authors, is observed in almost 40% of non-cholestatic neonates leading to low speci- ficity [18]. Moreover, MR cholecystopancreatography is more complex to perform than US and has lower diagnostic perfor- mance. This conclusion is in agreement with ESPGHAN
ccmb | (European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) and NASPGHAN (North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) guidelines [49].
ma93 | Concerning hepatobiliary scintigraphy, this analysis shows its very limited role in the diagnosis of biliary atresia because its specificity is very limited with false-positive results in pa- tients presenting with severe medical cholestasis with very limited or even absent choleresis. This again is in agreement with ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN guidelines [49].
c6hh | More invasive imaging techniques with direct opacification of the biliary tract using percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography have been evaluated and show good diagnostic performance. However, the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is very limited by the need of specific endoscopic equipment with trained operators. Percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography has very good diagnostic performance to confirm or rule out biliary atresia in difficult cases.
y7ea | Percutaneous liver biopsy remains an important but imperfect tool for the diagnosis of biliary atresia since histological biliary atresia features vary with time related to the evolution of the dis- ease and may overlap with non-biliary atresia cholestatic diseases.
nav4 | According to the results of our systematic review, parts 1 [13] and 2, and consensus of the ESPR Abdominal Taskforce, we proposed at the 2019 ESPR annual meeting in Helsinki a biliary atresia decisional flowchart (Fig. 6). In a neonate with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with or without acholic stools, US should be the first imaging examination. The sufficient duration of fasting for US <LATEX>\left( > 4 \quad h \right)</LATEX> is of paramount importance, and we suggest re- peating US on the same day after adequate fasting in doubtful cases. Gallbladder abnormalities, triangular cord sign, micro- or macrocyst, polysplenia, intestinal malrotation, preduodenal portal vein, interrupted inferior vena cava and abdominal heterotaxia have to be searched for and, if possible, elastography should be applied to assess liver stiffness. Dilated intrahepatic bile ducts can rule out biliary atresia. In an infant (<30 days old) with low clinical suspicion and normal US findings, we could consider repeating clinical examination, US and biological tests every week; if US findings are normal and cholestasis resolves, no further imaging is needed, but if cholestasis with acholic stools persists or occurs, percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be per- formed at the same time as liver biopsy. In cases of equivocal findings on US and very young patients with partially acholic stools, atypical patterns suggestive of medical causes or normal US findings and children between 30 and 60 days of age, we propose percutaneous cholecysto-cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, according to local facili- ties, and liver biopsy. In cases of suggestive US liver findings and syndromic presentation or suggestive US liver findings and high clinical and biological suspicion, biliary opacification should be done under general anesthesia in the operating room and
gem8 | followed by surgical biopsy and a Kasai procedure if normal bile ducts are absent.
e8nr | Our study has several limitations. The papers included a patient age range of 3-360 days, which is very large for an evolutive pathology that we must diagnose as early as possi- ble, and it creates a real bias especially because some US signs (triangular cord sign and hilar cysts) are age dependent as are the results of liver biopsy. Patient characteristics among stud- ies were different; for example, cystic forms of biliary atresia were excluded in some studies. There is a heterogeneity of study design and we included only English language papers.
k78w | Conclusion
g9du | Early diagnosis of biliary atresia is of paramount prognostic im- portance and is the main goal of imaging. No single diagnostic test has an accuracy of 100% and, because biliary atresia is a progres- sive disease, the diagnostic signs could have a late onset; hence, sensitivity and specificity will vary with age. Among imaging techniques, US has a high specificity, although a normal US ex- amination does not rule out biliary atresia diagnosis. Other imag- ing techniques with direct opacification of the biliary tree associ- ated with percutaneous liver biopsy have roles in doubtful cases. MR cholecystopancreatography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy have no role in diagnosing biliary atresia. According to the results of our systematic review parts 1 [13] and 2 and consensus of the ESPR Abdominal Taskforce, we propose a decisional flowchart for biliary atresia diagnosis based on US signs, including
