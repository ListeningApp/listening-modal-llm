You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

EXAMPLE INPUT:
ccpt | stigate the effectiveness of psychedelics for ADHD symp- toms in adults.
0fpw | 2. Materia1 and methods
dqn8 | 2.1. Study design and participants
cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).
1piq | 2.3. Measures
7fqw | 2.3.1. Demographic information and history of substance use
rhaz | At baseline, demographic information was collected. History of substance use assessed experience with psyche- delics (i.e., ayahuasca, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, novel lysergamides (e.g., 1P-LSD, ALD-52), psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ibogaine, and mescaline) in both full (psychedelic) doses and microdoses.
wak1 | 2.3.2. Psychiatric and physiological diagnoses
wtfz | Participants were asked whether they had a current diagnosis of a disorder. These answer options were chosen because most of the listed diagnoses are often reported to co-occur with ADHD (Kooij et al., 2019), or because these diagnoses were reported to be common in people who microdose (Fadiman and Korb, 2019).

b780 | With regard to the second approach, Bowles and Park (2005) reveal that income inequality increases working hours and consequently contributes to the growth of energy con- sumption and CO2 emissions (Knight et al. 2013; Fitzgerald et al. 2015, 2018; Jorgenson et al. 2017, 2019). Furthermore, the latter approach in this paper contributed to the explication of the theories on the impact of income inequality on production-based CO2 emissions. In addition, it separated the effects of scale, composition, technique and globalization. Therefore, the abovementioned channels of EKC, by the means of which economic growth affects environmental qual- ity, could be applied when analysing the relationship between inequality and CO2 emissions. Thus, the inequality deter- mined changes in working time could be attributed to the scale effect, when income inequality contributes to an increase in working hours and, analogically, to economic growth.
ccmb | Inequality, via contribution to economic growth, influences the growth of environmental pollution (Grunewald et al. 2017; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Rao and Min 2018; McGee and Greiner 2018).
ma93 | Referring to the composition effect, Gassebner et al. (2008) declared that in developed countries the increasing level of inequality is related to the industrial decline, which in turn reduces pollution. Meanwhile, in poorer countries, the rising industrial sector leads to the reduction of environmental reg- ulations, when richer segments of population are related to the growing industrial sector. Consequently, these arguments re- veal that in both poor and rich countries, different links be- tween income inequality and CO2 pollution could be observed (Grunewald et al. 2017).
c6hh | In terms of the technique effect, the reviewed authors re- vealed that a high level of inequality negatively affects the diffusion of environmental technologies and innovations (Vona and Patriarca 2011; Zhang and Zhao 2014). Thus, a high level of inequality can influence the reduction of tech- nologies, which determines the increase of carbon emissions.
y7ea | Inequality level also influences trade and FDI transfers. With the high level of inequality investors are not inclined to invest, and in such countries, it is hard to develop international trade. Therefore, inequality via the globalization effect can contribute to either reduction or growth of CO2 pollution. It depends on whether trade and FDI enhance or reduce envi- ronmental impact.
nav4 | The approaches to the influence of income inequality on consumption-based CO2 emissions
gem8 | The influence of income inequality on consumption-based carbon emissions can be explained referring to the following two approaches: (i) inequality determined changes in working time (which is also suitable in the case of production-based emissions and is related to "Veblen effect") and (ii) individual economic behaviours of households (or individual
e8nr | With regard to the changes in working hours, authors have stated that people work more in order to copy the lifestyle of individuals who have higher status (Bowles and Park 2005; Chancel et al. 2018). Thus, at the same time, the increase in working time contributes to economic growth and to the con- sumption increase as well, influencing the growth of pollution (Jorgenson et al. 2017). In consumer society, people usually work more in order to buy more and to consequently support the self-image. It is particularly typical in unequal countries due to "Veblen effect". Veblen (1934) hypothesized that peo- ple from different social classes are more inclined to compare their lifestyle with other individuals from a higher social class and to mimic their consumption style. Particularly, it is ob- served in more unequal societies. Consequently, due to the Veblen status, consumption or, put in other words, the con- sumption competition (Schor 1998), wealthier or higher- income groups are more inclined to consume large amounts of goods and services (Veblen 1934; Jorgenson et al. 2017, 2019; Grunewald et al. 2017) and thus determine the environ- mental pollution (Ravallion et al. 2000; Wolde-Rufael and Idowu 2017).
k78w | With regard to the individual consumption level, the MPE indicates that at various levels of income and inequality dis- tribution, individuals' propensities to consume more polluting goods differ due to the change in the patterns of consumption level (Ravallion et al. 2000; Borghesi 2006; Grunewald et al. 2012; Jorgenson et al. 2017). Hence, Jorgenson et al. (2017) declared that consumption level was the key factor influencing the MPE. However, there is not a single hypothesis analysing the inequality influence on consumption-based CO2 emis- sions. The main condition of the changes in income inequality affecting the consumption-based carbon emissions depends
