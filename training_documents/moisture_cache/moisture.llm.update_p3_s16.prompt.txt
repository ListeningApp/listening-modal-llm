You will receive raw text from an OCR scan of a document or web page. Each line of input represents one textbox from the document. Your task is to faithfully reproduce the text for our text-to-speech engine so that it is easily read aloud.

Note that the text might not start at the beginning and paragraphs may be split acrosss multiple textboxes. Textboxes may start or end in the middle of a word which is acceptable: do not combine text between textboxes and leave broken words at the start and end of a textbox unchanged.

You will receive one textbox per-line in the format `id | Textbox content`. The output must be in the format `id | Clean content`.

RULES:
 • Remove inline citations and references e.g. "(Author, 2021)" or "(https://wikipedia.org/article.html)" or "[ECMOS 35b, 47, 49]".
 • Spell out numbers, dates, and chemical formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "-2.5" -> "negative two point five" or "Jan. 2020" -> "January twenty twenty".
 • Spell out LaTeX formulas for the TTS engine e.g. "<LATEX>p = 1</LATEX>" -> "P equals one".
 • Rejoin hyphenated word fragments within the same textbox e.g. "synth -esize" -> "synthesize".
 • Fix simple typos and OCR errors e.g. "O nce upon a 1ime." -> "Once upon a time.".
 • Delete nonsequiter textboxes that interrupt the middle of a sentence if they obviously do not belong.

Otherwise, the output should exactly match the input text:
 • Do not combine text across lines or attempt to fix words broken across lines.
 • Ensure each ID from the input is included in the output.
 • Make as few changes as possible while respecting the above rules.

cop0 | The study employed a naturalistic design, assessing the experiences of participants at bas-,
lhkq | eline before they start, and at 2 and 4 weeks after initiation. The target population included adults with ADHD symptoms who had not been diag- nosed with ADHD before. To be included, participants needed to score on Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS-S:SV). This cut-off was indicative of clinically elevated symptoms (Conners et al., 1999) (see section 2.3).
82ju | 2.2. Study procedure
y2qo | The online advertisement was placed on a website providing information about psychedelics (www.microdo sing.nl). Interested participants were redirected to information explaining the study rationale and procedure. The baseline survey took 20 min to complete. If the survey had not been completed after 24 h, a reminder was sent. Each of the surveys at the 2- and 4-week time points took about 15 min to complete. Par- ticipants were able to pause the surveys. Data collection occurred between Nov. 2020 and Jul. 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Psy- chology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University (ERCPN- 215_05_11_2019_A1).

A 50 mm wide ring is removed from the center of the length including layers external to the insulation screen or, alternatively, the conductor. A tube at least 10 mm in diameter is placed vertically over the exposed ring and sealed to the surface of the oversheath. Normally tap water is used to fill the tube. A period of five minutes is allowed for filling. The height of the water in the tube is 1000 mm above the center of the cable. The water is allowed to stand for 24 hours. The sample is then subjected to 10 heating cycles. The conductor is heated until it reaches a temperature not less than 5° C or more than 15° C above the maximum rated temperature of the insulation in normal operation. The heating cycle is 8 hours on and 16 hours off.
g9du | A working group of CIGRE Study Committee 21 is preparing recommendations on tests for
f682 | high voltage cables with synthetic insulation and laminated protective coverings as moisture barriers. These tests will supplement those of IEC 840, First Edition, 1988. The recommendations are to be published in the Electra journal in 1991 after amendments are made.
li1k | IEEE/ICC Task Group 6-23 Activities
pbea | of the Insulated Conductors Committee (ICC) of the IEEE has undertaken, and is nearing completion, the preparation of an IEEE standard entitled "Guide on the Design, Testing and Application of Moisture Impervious, Solid Dielectric, 5 - 35 kv, Power Cable Using Metal/Plastic Laminates". The IEEE Standards Board has established Project No. P-1142 as the official identification for this endeavor. The task group is composed of representatives from utilities, industries, cable manufacturers, distributors and material suppliers. This task group was originally established to develop a guide on the use of metal/plastic laminates as , moisture barriers in all types of cable. The scope was subsequently narrowed to encompass only medium voltage power cables.
ccpt | Task Group 6-23
0fpw | As presently constituted, the guide includes sections on moisture barrier cable designs, metal/plastic laminates used for moisture barriers, cable performance and testing criteria and installation guidelines. Also included is a complete bibliography of technical papers, patents and specifications applicable to cables designed to preclude the effects of moisture.
dqn8 | Presently, the task group has under consideration such matters as testing for the effects of moisture on insulation materials both by direct and indirect means. Direct means involve techniques for measuring the moisture content of the insulation. Indirect means involve electrical tests, such as dielectric strength and impulse, in order to determine if there has been a deterioration in insulation performance. Likewise, further consideration is being given to means for measuring the integrity of the moisture barrier. Another task is to resolve differences between proposed test methods for determining the overall performance of the cable in blocking the longitudinal movement of moisture. Draft No. 6 of this guide will soon be balloted by the voting members of the ICC.
cop0 | ICEA Activities on Strand Filling
lhkq | A more recent technological advance in the development of water impervious power cables has been the use of strand filling materials to block the longitudinal flow of moisture in the conductors. Working Group 610 of the Insulated Cable Engineers Association (ICEA) was established in June 1985 with three priorities for developing tests for cable with filled conductors. The first was to prepare a guide on testing for resistance to water penetration. The second was to develop tests for compatibility of the filler compound with adjacent cable materials (conductor screen) . The third was to consider requirements for connectability testing of sealed conductors.
82ju | The "Guide for Conducting a Longitudinal Water Penetration Resistance Test for Sealed
y2qo | Conductors" was published in September 1989.14 The test procedure for qualification calls for two cable samples, 2 m long (7.5ft). One is heated to 90C for one hour and the other is cooled to 0℃ for an hour. After conditioning, the samples are bent around a mandrel for three reverse bends. A 1 m (3ft.) sample is attached to a pressurized water system and subjected to 35 kPa (5 psi) for one hour. For a production test one sample is subjected to pressure for 15 minutes without conditioning, but after being subjected to three reverse bends. Thus, the guide consists of both a qualification test and a production test.
1piq | The second priority of the ICEA working group was to develop a guide for establishing the compatibility of the filler compound used to seal the conductor. 15 The criteria for compatibility is the effect the filler has on the volume resistivity stability of the semiconducting compound used as the conductor screen. The working group has reviewed six test procedures and two have been completely tested and evaluated. A third procedure is presently under test. Variation in testing methodologies are being defined.
7fqw | The work on the third priority, connect- ability, has been discontinued. The ICEA charter does not permit it to deal with accessories. However, extensive work by several organizations has indicated that connectability of strand filled conductors will not be changed versus unsealed conductors. Connectability is considered feasible with standard commercial connectors. 16, 17
rhaz | De-Facto Standards - French Specifications
wak1 | Watertight, medium voltage, synthetic insulated cable has been in use by Electricite de France (EdF) since 1978. Longitudinal water tightness is provided by a hygroscopic powder laid inside longitudinal grooves of the semiconducting insulation screen. Radial water tightness is obtained via an aluminum screen which is adhesively bonded to a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) oversheath. The
wtfz | A cable meets EdF Standard HN 33-S-23. complete body of standards has been developed to cover accessories (HN 33-M-03) , 24 kV plug- in terminations (HN 52-S-61) single core terminations (HN 68-S-06) , joints (HN 68-S-07 and HN 68-S-08) , and connectors (HN 68-S-04) . The connectors developed for the aluminum screen do not require stripping of the sheath. Thus, a complete technology package has been developed for the watertight cable design.
qy1i | Specific tests for water tightness are included in the HN 33-S-23 specification. The longitudinal water tightness test is carried out after three bending cycles. A 10 mm wide ring is cut out of the oversheath in the middle of a 3 m long sample. The area around the ring is enclosed in a small tank that is sealed to the oversheath. The tank is filled with water and a water head of 800 mm is maintained over the sealed area. The sample is subjected to a 24 hour period at ambient temperature without current. Then 10 thermal cycles are applied bringing the conductor to 100° C for 4 hours, followed by a 4 hour cooling period. No water leakage is permitted from the sample ends.
1k9e | For radial water tightness an immersion withstand test is used. A sample at least 10 m long is immersed in water with the ends exposed. A voltage at twice the operating voltage of the cable is applied. A current is applied to bring the temperature of the conductor to 100° C in parts of the cable not immersed in water. Thermal cycling of 8 hours on and 16 hours off for 200 thermal cycles or 5,000 hours is required without electrical breakdown of the insulation.
5bjs | The cable standard also contains tests for checking the compatibility of the cable components and a metallic shield corrosion test is under consideration.
