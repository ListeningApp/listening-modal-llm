Persons who need information about grief and loss and to normalize what they are experiencing can use such pages to obtain information about the grief process. These are generally not interactional pages but are pages set up to give information on a topic. There are, however, some sites that allow the reader to ask a question about a particular topic that may or may not be answered by another person reading that particular page.\n4cgs | Six. Communicating with the deceased. Some sites and some Facebook pages are set up in the name of the deceased. Mourners may use these pages to regularly write to the deceased, often in a letter format, expressing their thoughts, feelings, and questions. Those who have studied this phenomenon find that such communications with the deceased are primarily used for the purpose of meaning making and second for providing a continuing bond with the deceased.\nhtre | For more information on Internet resources for cyber mourning, I would refer you to the book Dying, Death, and Grief in an Online Universe, edited by Sofka, Cupit, and Gilbert, and published by Springer Publishing in twenty twelve.\nda3c | WHAT IS THE NATURE OF COMPLICATED BEREAVEMENT?\n890q | For years, most of those working with complicated mourning and grief therapy have used terms like chronic grief, delayed grief, and absent grief to delineate the diagnosis of those with complicated bereavement or complicated mourning. In fact, some of these concepts were defined by consensus when Beverly Raphael and Warwick Middleton conducted a survey to determine which terms were the most frequently used by leading therapists in the field. Although there was a surprising degree of consensus, the problem is that complicated grief is a Z code in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and Z code diagnoses do not qualify for third-party payment through insurance carriers. Another problem has been the lack of precise definitions of these terms, which makes rigorous research of them difficult. The easiest solution has been to conduct research using well-defined pathological entities like depression, anxiety, and somatization, for which there are good standardized measures. Although these clinical entities may be part of the mourner's experience, they clearly are not measures of grief. There were a few\njomo | measures of grief like the Texas Revised Grief Inventory and the Hogan Grief Reaction Checklist, but most were normed on a clinical population.\n06fi | Beginning with the work of Holly Prigerson, Kathryn Shear, and Mardi Horowitz in the nineteen nineties, there has been a twenty-year-plus attempt to come up with a diagnosis of complicated grief that would be acceptable to go into the DSM-five, which was released in twenty thirteen. Such a diagnosis would make insurance money available for the treatment of patients with this diagnosis and would make research funds available for further investigation on this clinical entity. Details on this diagnosis, its development, and its current status can be found in Chapter Five.\nhb4s | DISENFRANCHISED GRIEF\ncqq2 | This term, coined by Ken Doka and further developed by Attig, has been an important addition to the field. Although Doka's first volume came out in nineteen eighty-nine, he updated the concept in a second volume that came out in two thousand two. Disenfranchised grief refers to losses in the mourner's life of relationships that are not socially sanctioned. A classic example would be the death of someone with whom the mourner is having an affair. If this affair is not widely known, the mourner will not be invited to participate in the funeral rituals and may not receive the social support that many people find helpful after a death. Alternate lifestyles may not be socially sanctioned, and the friend or lover may be ostracized by the family of the deceased. There are numerous other examples of disenfranchised grief, and there are suggestions in this book for re-enfranchising some of these losses to aid the mourner in adapting to the loss.\n1ews | Aaron Lazare, an early colleague at Massachusetts General Hospital, talked about two kinds of loss that are directly related to this concept of disenfranchised grief. Socially negated losses are those losses that society treats as nonlosses. An example of this would be pregnancy loss, either spontaneous or induced. The second kind of loss related to disenfranchised grief would be socially unspeakable losses. These are specific losses about which the mourner has a difficult time talking. Common examples would be death by suicide and death by AIDS. Both of these losses carry some stigma in the broader society. One intervention that can be helpful to those experiencing these types of losses is assisting them in talking about them and exploring their thoughts and feelings about the death. Re-enfranchising suggestions for these types of losses can be found in Chapter Seven of this volume.\nafyn | Introduction\n8sye | CONTINUING BONDS\n```",
